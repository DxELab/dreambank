    "description": "These dreams come from Emma's husband, who is called \"Frank\" in Emma's dream series. His series is far shorter and more sporadic than hers. He only wrote down dreams of special interest to him, or that he thought would be of interest to people with whom he corresponded. There are often gaps of many years between dream reports.  They were not kept in a regular journal; the 72 dreams were brought together in one place by him well after Emma gave us her series, and he did so at her urging. They appeared in scattered notes and copies of old letters to various friends. They came to us on musty scraps of paper, in envelopes with postmarks on them, and on thin, barely readable pieces of carbon paper. We made photocopies and returned the originals to him.
