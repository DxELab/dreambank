"Alicia(P)-01"	"(1995-12-06)"	"#Alicia(P)-01 (1995-12-06) I'm heading towards the ocean in a fancy sports car, a Porsche. I pay the parking attendant $700 cash to let me park anytime for a few days. (The $700 was given to me by my fiancÂŽ.) Actually, I want to throw the car off the cliff because it's a ticking bomb. When it goes over (to everyone's amazement) it becomes embedded in the soft side of the hill and doesn't explode. It's actually landed in a car park for tourists. Switch to: This is some part of a Mob hit for some Mafia gang (90's not 50's). Head back to the beach with my friend who was looking for a cool book (titled Grapes?). I try to decipher the title but I can't keep the book because it's tied to the Mafia. Switch to: Mob people want to give me a puppy. I go into a room, there's a bunch of Siberian Husky pups, but the one who's given to me has colors that are mottled. I ask what sex it is (it's a boy), I say, ""Oh, I wanted a girl."" I look nearby and its mother looks like it's been put through a meat grinder -- literally. I notice some of the pups (there is a table full) have extra ear flaps on top of their heads! The mother looks like it was attacked by wolves. It's badly hurt, a bloody mess. Switch to: Catching an elevator going to work. Looks like the BofA building. Notice someone caught using the phone in elevator -- must jump on cause I've pushed the button. This person resembles Maribeth O'Rourke, actually turns out to be some other news anchor going up to the ""garden on the roof."" We decide to make a special lunch there for the anchor and three other friends. I include myself and start dishing out salad makings. It turns out anchor is going to have surgery (she's crouching in the corner of the elevator, crying). I feel sorry for her and try to tell her not to have the surgery atop this place. Surgery turns out to be removing lump from her breast. I offer better doctors, she says she has no choice. Nurse comes out with tray full of papers and says this is the place she must have the surgery for some reason. Back to serving lunch. My friend and I dish out salad while Beatles' song plays in background (Eight Days a Week). I sing ""Oooh, I need your love babe ..."" to the end where I forget the last lines. My friend says she wants to get some of the egg in the salad -- it's special -- ""It's a red egg from India."" I don't see it at first then I notice I have a whole one in the salad (bright dark red) hard boiled. Yolk is deep rich red; looks appetizing, but I can't eat it."
"Alicia(P)-02"	"(1995-12-06)"	"#Alicia(P)-02 (1995-12-06) I am at work in the Master Control room. I am running the shows, when my co-worker Tom breezes in from around the corner, takes me in his arms and gives me a deep soulful kiss! I am surprised but not entirely resistant. He begins to stroke and massage my breasts while kissing me. I absolutely swoon! I'm a little concerned about the programs on air but I don't want to pull away from the embrace. My breasts are so sore and the massaging and stroking are so exquisite I practically climax!"
"Alicia(P)-03"	"(1995-12-07)"	"#Alicia(P)-03 (1995-12-07) Begins in a busy TV station newsroom (hustle bustle more like a TV show about a newsroom). News producer Dan is getting ready to put on show. Everyone walking around. I'm in the middle trying to do my part but I no longer work there. Somehow music to one of my favorite musicals (West Side Story) comes on. Some people begin to sing (Something's Coming). They don't know all the words but I do. I grab a mike and sing the whole song (to everyone's amazement) catching the attention of a powerful female executive producer. She mentions something about how great TV has led to my knowing such a wonderful thing. I say, ""It's not television, it's the writing!"" Everybody stops and looks at me as if I've committed a great faux pas. The woman exec asks me to come with her. Switch to: On our way to the Opera House, she wants to know about me. I tell her more about my sister who is a bigwig at the Opera House ""in a man's world."" Some of show happens -- I excuse myself and go the bathroom and note I need to fix my hair (still in curlers under scarf). Go back to lobby where it's breaktime. The woman exec is gone but her other cronies (all young 20-something year olds) eye me suspiciously and try to get more info out of me. They are very surprised to know I have a 12-year old son. I begin to leave. On the way out (seems like I'm on some European Street in Greece or Rome) and a sandal floats by in the gutter (some man, an Italian valet of sorts, hands me a note. I am to return this sandal to a hotel. I instinctively know the woman exec is waiting for me in a room there. She will seduce me. Switch to: Myself in a coach with my sister, and another (my mother?). She is laughing about this whole story I'm relating. Back to my being on European Street, etc. My sister now laughing. I'm laughing too because I know I'm on my way to be seduced. I say, ""Hey, I can do this easy! I'll be the woman's driver/chauffeur, if it will get me back my job!"""
"Alicia(P)-04"	"(1995-12-08)"	"#Alicia(P)-04 (1995-12-08) Classroom situation (looks like my old elementary school), but it's more of a college class. Several adults including myself in wooden chairs waiting for teacher. My supervisor from work, Lynne, comes in. She's the teacher, and announces a test on the book Treasure Island. (We are all disgruntled.) I protest. Getting haughty. I say the book is boring. She flashes back ""It's not like you're paying that much attention."" Alluding to my current lackadaisical, somewhat tired approach to work lately. I feel embarrassed and angry. However, somewhere in this dream, I don't remember at what point, someone is surprised at my interest and knowledge in great literature. I say jokingly, ""Well not only do I watch PBS, but I also read extensively."""
"Alicia(P)-05"	"(1995-12-09)"	"#Alicia(P)-05 (1995-12-09) Back at the newsroom studios with man and woman who do the news, among others. They are in the midst of a broadcast reporting about the possibilities (and hazards) of an earthquake. They even cut to a reporter, who talks to some night club owner about what happened to him and his place during the last one. They cut to some video of his home/bar where a camera catches everything in motion. The quake is so violent, one can see the people inside, a grandmother, grandfather, and granddaughter being tossed about like ragdolls. I even see the horrible impacts. Their look reminds me of crash test dummies. During the commercial, there is the general repartee between us all when I notice we are all in some arctic place -- not our usual city. The studio/or the show is being done out of some ice capades auditorium and a segment coming up has to do with some singers (they are practicing). I notice one of them is my first husband! I mention this to the anchorwoman who asks when was I married. I said I was very young. She is surprised and mentions to the rest of the crew that my first husband is there. She is even more surprised when I say I've been married twice before and am about to get married again. We come back from commercial break and the anchorman says to camera audience, ""Well, like Polly says, you could be looking at a bird in a tree but someone else might think you are considering eating the berries on it which are poisoned."" He then throws it to the weatherman. The sports guy asides, ""I'm glad you didn't toss it to me, I don't know how I would have responded to that."" The weatherman just winks and makes a funny face. Switch to: my focusing on my ex (they are practicing a song when I notice the instructor is my old college audio teacher Ken). Anyway, the guys take a break and I walk up, dressed in a sort skirt suit and say hi. My ex is flabbergasted. We walk out of the auditorium and he says to me, ""Doesn't this bother you at all?"" And I smile and say, ""I'm just continually amazed."" Switch to back inside the auditorium, children are being let in for an indoor recess (too cold outside). I see my sister heads a table with many children saying something about how she's sorry she didn't get them in sooner to see the TV stars. Back outside my ex and his team are going to do some kayaking expedition."
"Alicia(P)-06"	"(1995-12-09)"	"#Alicia(P)-06 (1995-12-09) I'm a male, someone in a Gothic tale. I must assemble Bono of U2 or Sting. I'm in a medieval castle with other people. For some reason, these people decide to make a game out of beating and torturing me. I believe I'm killed, but I see that once they're done with me, they want to play the ""game"" with some poor blond serving girl. They also beat her to within an inch of her life. Next fragment: I am leaving the city with my friend Nan and hook up with Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. We're headed to Chicago. I've never been so thrilled. I tell them I really want to move to Chicago. Once there (Madonna no longer with us), we go to EDD office. I'm carrying a dresser and have to guard it so it doesn't get stolen. I almost miss my appointment. Meanwhile, Nan and Rosie are trying out for a women's baseball team. It's exciting but they don't get in. Three other girls do. They are small and brown (ethnic) in Catholic school uniforms. We need to get ""home."" We're staying at someone's apartment. On the way home, I have to cling to the back of the car -- some old little vehicle -- and on the way am chased by a black dog. I think the dog wants to hurt me, but it just wants to play. We get to the house and I leave my dresser outside in the doorway. (Dog stays out too.) Inside, the girls are playing. The game consists of warding off attacks with a small glass table top. The attacks are with tomatoes or soft foods but when I get the glass, I chip it. We try to put it back where we found it so no one can tell."
"Alicia(P)-07"	"(1995-12-11)"	"#Alicia(P)-07 (1995-12-11) I'm on the freeway heading home from work. As usual, I'm in a hurry, but find myself stopped cold by a traffic jam. It is so severe I get out of the car and walk up to see the cause. Cars are stopped in both directions. They are also jam packed. I get to the head of the problem but do not see why precisely we are stopped. For some reason, we are to be there for days. I meet a man in another car and we instantly fall in love. Somehow, somewhere, we end up making love. We plan to build a life together. I don't remember how this one ends."
"Alicia(P)-08"	"(1995-12-11)"	"#Alicia(P)-08 (1995-12-11) I'm at the Riding Stables. I am watching the horses. Somehow, I am responsible for putting one of the horses away. There is a dog running around the training field. I try getting the horse to cooperate. It lies down for me to untack it, but once I remove the saddle it bolts up and away. I know I'm in trouble. I go to report the incident to the office, saying I don't know where the horse has gone. The co-owner, Marta, is not too terribly mad, but I feel awful, stupid. I go to look for the horse and pass behind the stalls where a school group is playing baseball. I'm on my way down the road when I see a girl/woman riding the horse towards me. She is wearing a bright red dressage jacket and beige jodhpurs. I flag her down. She very nicely tells me the horse was wandering around her (very exclusive) riding school. I thank her profusely for finding it. She turns over the makeshift reins to me, which I try to fix with string. She tells me to attach my string to the blue end as it's stronger. Meanwhile, just before as I'm passing the baseball field, I forgot to relate that my 12-year old son had just been let out of school and I ask him if he saw the horse. He said no. I said I needed to look for it. That's when the woman rode up. After I retrieved the horse, I took it back to its stable where two guys were waiting with one horse already saddled. Marta asked me to saddle up the renegade horse as they were going for a trail ride. I was happy for them (but sad for me)."
"Alicia(P)-09"	"(1995-12-12)"	"#Alicia(P)-09 (1995-12-12) My husband and I have bought a new house (my husband in this dream is a total stranger). We are living in the downstairs quarters when I notice that a strange, older man keeps popping up. He seems to be the previous owner. I feel we are being persecuted and we go upstairs to confront the ex-owner. Upstairs is empty but fully furnished. We feel we have bought this house and can live upstairs. We start to discover the different bedrooms. At one point the older man comes in and starts to terrorize me. My husband has gone to get some form of defense. He comes back with a club or bludgeon. Meanwhile, this old guy is trying to strangle me and I yell at my husband to go get one of his many guns -- ""That's what they're for! I'm angry!"" While he goes off, I begin to get sexually aroused by the physical mess of the struggle. I tell the older guy I'm getting excited and he begins to ravish me. He has a long penis. Other people join in, men and women. I am getting the screw of my life. My husband comes back in and is angry. The others all disappear. I am still very turned on and want my husband to fuck me. He does so, angrily, when next I notice my 12-year old son come in (he's a deck level above us) and he excuses himself for interrupting but didn't know we were ""doing it."" I get up to go answer the door and find an attractive woman looking for the previous owner. We are immediately attracted to one another and push towards a room where we can have sex. After which she comes up and meets my husband and son. She says my husband is a hunk and quite handsome. She remarks that usually sex goes out the window once you're married. I feel this is so true. When she meets my son, she gives me a smile and ""slaps me a 5"" in the old way -- down low -- saying my son is equally good looking. I turn around and notice the old man is walking away -- down the stairs into the street -- with a young boy of about five. I realize they are both ghosts. I was being haunted. "
"Alicia(P)-10"	"(1995-12-13)"	"#Alicia(P)-10 (1995-12-13) Mostly forgettable dreams last night, but the first one stands out -- short, but to the point: I'm lying in a small pool of blood. The blood is coming from my swollen belly, from the belly button, to be exact."
"Alicia(P)-11"	"(1995-12-14)"	"#Alicia(P)-11 (1995-12-14) I call this story/dream: ""The Little Snake in the Grass."" It seems two men have come to kidnap me because one of them has a sick fixation on me, the other (his name is Rudy) obeys what the other guy says. They both appear in a video about ... ?? It's a cross between a sex video and a children's video. I don't see anything graphic but there are some kinky allusions to (anal?) sex. Anyway, Guy #1 (I'll call him ""Fixation Guy"") won't leave me be. He has to have me. He'll go to any lengths. I feel he has a gun. My second ex-husband and son are kidnapped along with me. I try to reason with the guy and find a way to escape the house we're in (it's in my old neighborhood). So I get my second ex,and my son and get to the car waiting outside. But it's blocked by another car I parked there. I run to move this car while my ex and son get in the other car to escape. I'm yelling instructions all this time. We finally move but somehow end up being caught by Fixation Guy again, only this time, he's already killed his friend Rudy because he doesn't want anyone in his way. I feel bad, I know Rudy loved him and try to tell him that and he is momentarily upset. But he wants sex from me. Somehow I am in black leather, dominatrix-style, and begin pounding into his butt (he is down doggie-style) but there is no actual penetration, just impact. (Another guy walks in on this but is not surprised by what he sees.) I'm yelling and abusive towards him -- he likes this -- so he'll leave me alone. After this, we're all trying to get some sleep, somehow my soon-to-be stepfather is in the bed with us (trying to protect me) when Fixation Guy comes back. Ã¥y future stepfather tries to hold him off. I get angry and take away the handcuffs the guy has bought, run outside and throw them in the dark, muddy field that was the front yard. A strange woman has entered the scene and she temporarily distracts Fixation Guy, but I find him once again after me. When we go back in the house, the strange, dark (and very beautiful) woman is lying down explaining she didn't want to force the guy, since he's only a ""little snake in the grass"" and I immediately make up a little tune that tells of this whole adventure. It rhymes and makes perfect sense. I wish I could remember a few lines but I can't, except that it ended with ""A little snake in the grass."""
"Alicia(P)-12"	"(1995-12-16)"	"#Alicia(P)-12 (1995-12-16) Again, this is sketchy since I'm writing it so late: All I can remember is that it takes place on a freeway. I see some guys (they seem to be Hispanics or just rowdy teenagers) in a car. They are speeding down the freeway when the car spins out of control and flips over into a ditch. I watch in horror as the car flips several times -- almost in slow motion. I can see the limbs of the occupants being crushed. Amazingly, they somehow survive the crash and begin to argue over whose fault it was. Then they run from the scene before the cops come. I see gas leaking from the car, then watch it go up in flames. Since the car has landed in a dry, grassy ditch, the fire begins to spread and I feel the whole city is going to catch fire. I somehow know chaos will break loose and there will be riots and looting."

I am told to report to the gym where the teacher looks at me and has me do some weightlifting stuff. I labor through it but when I'm done he tells me I would be a perfect boxing candidate. He says I'd make a good wrestler too. I get out of there and end up in the swimming pool area where I see comedy/film stars Steve Martin, Martin Short and John Candy, hamming it up for a movie. I leave there and run outside where the party is, only to run into my co-worker (Tom), who asks me to dance a slow dance with him. I'm a little surprised since I know he's married. When we start to dance, he kisses me and though I'm strongly attracted to him, I push away. He says he wants me, then says he really gets turned on by women who ""look like sluts."" I see he is very drunk. I run away when other guys around us say, ""Tom, here comes your wife."" He is stumbling trying to chase me. I run back into the gym where the gym teacher says, ""You absolutely have to be a boxer, you'd be great!"" I'm dressed in a clingy lilac long silk gown looking very shapely and buff. I tell him there's no way, I couldn't take the punches because I'm pregnant! And I much prefer riding horses. In the gym I see a girl suited up in red jacket and riding breeches pulling her riding helmet from her locker. I tell the gym coach that's what I'd rather be doing. At one point while I'm dancing with Tom, he asks me, ""Do you know what it's like not to have sex for year?"""

She is much farther along (Gwen is due 12/30). Anyway, my boss Susan is so excited but she kind of prefers Gwen (who I dream is having a girl, although she is actually having a boy!). Anyway, Susan is happy for me but kind of hustles past saying ""Oh, you're having the weenie."" In other words, I'm having a boy and that's not as much fun as having a girl. I find this amusing."

When I turned, I was outside the house and there was a field with a light shining on it and corn fields at the end of the field. I tried to run but when I started running, I turned into a beast -- white and thick, maybe hairy. I stopped and turned to look at the house and was myself again. So I turned to run again, and again I became the beast. There was a windmill in the field."

We walked around hill on road and below us was my friend Dan with his truck and tractor and trailer. He said he was doing some work down the road. My husband asked him about something and I noticed the tractor was a big mechanical mosquito. Then Dan said it was poisonous -- a plant that my son and I were holding and smelling sometime before; don't remember when. I disagreed and said ""Are you sure?"" Dan said ""Positive."" I said ""Let me go get it and show you to make sure."" I ran back toward my house noticing the new plowed road was high up and there were holes in the road that if you drove on it, it could fall through. I ran to what was an old chicken coop and climbed in a small chicken wire door. There was the plant but it was dried up so I turned to look for more and I noticed there was a rattlesnake so I turned to leave and right where I was before there was a rattlesnake with the dried weed in its mouth. I tried to move fast but the slow movement (where you can't do anything, no control of self or movements and you want to cry) got me and more and more snakes appeared."

I came to some glass doors and my husband was waiting for me on the street and started to leave. So I ran out waving my arms. He slowed down and I noticed I had no pants on. There was a women's clothing store so I went in; there was no one in there but two retail ladies. She asked if I needed anything and I said I wanted a dress. She showed me a magazine with ugly clothes and I pointed to a dress and asked, ""How much?"" She said, ""$147.00. I then noticed there were a lot of people in the store and I had my tan coat so I put on my coat and told the lady I was going to look around other shops but would probably be back to buy the dress.

The last thing I remember is having to go to the bathroom so I was in the gas station's bathroom and one of the guys came in and tried to either zip my pants up or down (I hadn't gone to the bathroom yet) and I told him that I could do it. I said it as if it were no big deal, but when he left, I checked my zipper and found that they were zipped up and was thinking that it was really weird.

It was outside and my mom was there with us. I was setting up a game on a table. The game was very elaborate and it took me a long time. When I finished, I was talking with my mom and as we looked out, we saw what appeared to be large dark clouds over water but ended up being thousands of black crows diving into water -- the scene was surreal -- dark and turbulent -- with brown muddy hills going up. I saw Bill Cosby there with a bunch of kids, and then started rallying up CharlieÃ•s class. I kept watching Charlie interact with his classmates and felt bad for him because he was trying so hard to please and make friends. He didn't seem upset, he just kept talking and laughing with everyone."

It was a huge place, like a restaurant, I said hello to him and he said hello, ""Hey, you can go get some espresso since it's 10 to 6,"" (because we were supposed to have lunch). I realized then how early it was and I felt good about being up and out so early. Alex was working on an elaborate structure (he's a sculptor) and it was to be a party of the party or event I was discussing earlier. It was actually hung outside his shop in this mall-type place -- it was huge -- two rows of gigantic musical notes and clefs in sliver, blue and white enamel. I was impressed with it and was surprised by how much work had been done since I last saw him. I told him I thought it was great and we were discussing it in greater detail -- he was telling me how he had to strip it, then glue it, then paint this enamel on, etc. "

I had stopped in Michigan and was staying at some unknown rich people's house, a man, his wife and their daughter. Everything was fine until the man became very frightening and tried to chase me. I ran to the next door neighbors, who protected me. The man had killed his daughter. For some reason, I knew I had to leave the neighbors because it was no longer safe. I walked down the street but the man and a friend of his chased me. I ran to a house where an old Indian woman lived and she let me in. The man was trying to get in the windows and doors and finally climbed on the roof to come down the chimney. He made it in the house and I grabbed a knife and so did he. We started dueling and somehow I got away and ran outside. Some unknown man in a car stopped and I jumped in and we drove away. He gave me a green key and said it was to his house."

The weird thing is that I was seeing through his eyes the whole dream -- as if I was him. He finally got out the door and to where he was going -- band practice. He kept apologizing for being late."

It was around 8:00 pm and I spent hours trying to decide what to wear. Then I went for a walk for some reason and when I came back to the apartment, I walked up the front stairs of the building (they were steep and winding stairs). This man ran up to me and grabbed me and was yelling (he was kind of mentally ill). He held me over the edge of the stairs and was threatening to push me over. I begged him not to, but he kept saying he would. I was crying and pleading. Then he stopped and just left. I went in and walked through these long hallways. When I got to my apartment, there was a girl (homeless) laying on the floor in front of my door. She asked if she could stay at my place. I said no because my parents were here -- it wasn't a good idea. She left. I unlocked the door and went in. I realized it was 2:00 am -- too late to go to the comedy club because it would be closed. Then I realized there was a new door in the apartment that was unlocked and led to the other hallway. I got scared. I waited for hours -- my dad and sister never came back and I was afraid to check on my mother -- I was scared something had happened to her. I just sat there and did nothing. I couldn't move -- I was paralyzed."

We went into a bathroom and a bunch of football players ran by. We got on a bus to go back to the hotel.

I went speeding to the airport desperately searching for someone although I don't know who. But it was urgent that I find that person. I'm in the airport and I'm going the opposite way as everyone else. There are hoards of people coming at me. They were in my way and slowing me down. I kept going downwards. I was running down the escalator which was going up. This also slowed me down. Then I had this overwhelming urge to go to the bathroom. I found one but three people were watching me go. The plane was taking off. It was on tracks like a roller coaster. I ran up the tracks and pounded on the door until the flight attendant let me in. I didn't have a ticket but I told her I was looking for someone. She asked me who it was and I started telling her names, family members mostly. However, none of these people were on the flight. But we'd already taken off. Suddenly, the plane started to nose-dive in a spiraling motion. I knew we weren't going to crash and then the plane gained altitude again. No one was really panicked about it. Like it was a normal occurrence. Then I looked out the window and saw a guy in a car (which was just kind of floating on the air next to us). It looked like some sort of space mobile. He was dropping two ladies off so they could catch the flight but they both just ended up being splatted against the windows. This didn't seem at all odd to me. We landed and I was with Lou. I was walking in front of him and I could feel him watching me and starting at my tattoos on my back. We landed somewhere unfamiliar; I had the sense it was another planet in outer space. But I knew that's where my destination was. We were smoking cigarettes but we didn't have to hold them. They just floated in the air in front of our mouths. We went to this area where it seemed as though a glass panel separated us from the creatures of this planet. They were animated cartoon figures like entities. They were putting on a show, like a musical, for us. One of them was a big blue angelfish. I was fascinated and really pleased that I'd finally arrived."

A foreboding feeling came over me and I knew this was not good. The man walked over to the truck where Marcie was and I knew that he was going to rape her. He seemed to be a middle-aged Hispanic man.

"Rose(A)-12"	"(1996-07-10)"	"#Rose(A)-12 (1996-07-10) I'm in church; somewhat of a cathedral and part theater. I sit down in the pew in the balcony. There are people from high school and teachers. People start talking to me. Somebody threw a wet wad of toilet paper at me. More people start doing the same thing. From all sides, people are saying things, asking me why I'm there, telling me that I shouldn't be there. Everyone is right in my face, surrounding me."
"Rose(A)-13"	"(1996-07-11)"	"#Rose(A)-13 (1996-07-11) I'm at a school. There are children everywhere. My friend Becky is holding her newborn and telling me that we really need to talk. It will be good for me, she says. She is looking straight into my eyes very closely. Andrea keeps telling me how I'll feel better if I talk."
"Rose(A)-14"	"(1996-07-12)"	"#Rose(A)-14 (1996-07-12) Driving in a car up north. The leaves are beautiful colors, like Fall. Many maple trees. Getting out, we walk out onto the lake which is frozen. A band is going to play and people are ice skating. A man is selling bikes -- neon green. A foreign man, middle-eastern, steps onto the ice and says that the band can't play today because the name of the band is ""Tomorrow."" They can't play tomorrow because it's Sunday. Sam (my fiancee) is playing the guitar. People are booing at the man who told them to stop. We leave on a bus, and Sam and I sneak past a blind woman who wanted to ""look"" at my ring."
"Rose(A)-15"	"(1996-07-13)"	"#Rose(A)-15 (1996-07-13) I go into the fish store to buy the green plant for my tank. It's very dark in the store. The man behind the counter shows me all different kinds of plans, but not the kind that I want. I leave and go to 219th Avenue. It's a beautiful residential area near The Park. Large houses and many trees. I walk up with someone to a large brick house and a man is walking. We go in to check his messages. We ordered Mexican food. I'm careful not to leave a mess. It gets very noisy. The peacefulness is gone."
"Rose(A)-16"	"(1996-07-14)"	"#Rose(A)-16 (1996-07-14) Barb (my youngest sister) shows me her engagement ring. It's made from some type of golden colored material, but the gold is flaking off. The metal is soft; so soft that I leave marks with my fingernail. Next to my ring it looks very cheap."
"Rose(A)-17"	"(1996-07-15)"	"#Rose(A)-17 (1996-07-15) Nick, his wife, Linda, and I are sitting/lying on my bed. We're all on top of the covers. I'm in the center on my stomach, Nick is to my left, his wife is to my right and they are both lying on their sides facing me. Linda is sitting somewhat behind me. We are looking at their wedding photos. His wife is talking and is very nice. Nick keeps looking at me. He asks me if I have any children. I tell him no. ""When do you plan on having kids?"" he asks. ""This is a good time, you would be a good mother."" His wife begins to talk about it too. I'm looking at their wedding pictures. The reception was in this large glass hall overlooking the night scene in LA. Nick is wearing a blue suit. My hand is underneath the photos and Nick puts his hand there and touches mine. I didn't move away. I look at him. His face has changed so much from the last time we met. His eyes are smaller and his mouth and nose are different too. Nick and I talked in low voices. I wanted to ask about Betty, but didn't want to make him angry."
"Rose(A)-18"	"(1996-07-16)"	"#Rose(A)-18 (1996-07-16) I'm lying on my back in bed. There are five or six people dressed in white surrounding the bed. One of them takes our cat away. Sam is in the kitchen and I call for him. Children are in the closet and I can't move. The people in white start picking them up, some are crying, others are reaching out to me. I call for Sam, but he doesn't come. They are taking all of the children away."
"Marsha(A)-01"	"(1996-06-02)"	"#Marsha(A)-01 (1996-06-02) Gwen and I are going on a hiking trip. The day is beautiful, the sun is shining and we're both quite happy. Suddenly, the hiking becomes rock climbing (the grassy hills have transformed into clay-red, jagged, rocky boulders). Gwen is unaware of the transformation of our surroundings. I, on the other hand, am acutely aware that my sense of stability and gravity are off. Gwen begins to descend; I'm irritated by this because I am now holding on for dear life and she's calling out to me, which is a major distraction. Cautiously looking downward, I see Gwen sliding down a water slide made of the same red clay, but very smooth. She's sliding down and yelling happily, for me to come join her. I want to; she looks like she's having so much fun, but the rocky edge I am clinging to has created a chasm between us. I'm so scared and afraid. I wish someone would make the jump with me. Suddenly an old man is standing beside me on the edge of the cliff, beckoning me to join him to jump. He jumps down to Gwen. The slide slopes into a pool where there are lots of other people laughing and splashing. Gwen is in the pool and calls for me to come down, but she cannot see how high up I am from her. Suddenly a new hot, clay-red boulder begins to emerge from the earth. It is huge and is shaking the foundation I am desperately trying to cling to. It erupts slowly taking my boulder higher. I can barely make Gwen out. I still hear her though, she sounds like a screeching mouse: ""Kerry, Kerry, come down."" I give up trying to jump or descend. I feel a lump in my throat, I want to cry. No tears come."
"Marsha(A)-02"	"(1996-06-23)"	"#Marsha(A)-02 (1996-06-23) My sister Ann and I are driving home from a family function that went on until really late. I'm in a rush to get home because I'm tired, cold, and nauseated. It's foggy and there are two large black men in the middle of the street. We both start to scream ""Oh my God! They have guns!"" Ann tries to swerve the car out of their way, but one of the thugs starts shooting and gives us a flat tire. They come over to the car and demand for us to get out. I'm going to be raped, is what I'm thinking. The men push Ann and me onto the sidewalk, face first. ""Now,"" the tallest one says, ""I'Ã•m gonna show you a picture and I want you to tell the truth if you seen this guy before."" This monster's gun is pointed at the back of my head. I can't see Ann. The darkest skinned bald-headed guy shoves the picture in my face and says, ""I'm not gon' tell you again."" I have no idea who the guy in the picture is. ""Bitch, you bet not be lying to me, cause I'm human, I ain't gon' blast you if you cooperate."" I hear him walk over to Ann. ""You know dude?"" ""No, I don't,"" I hear my older sister say, in the scaredest voice I've ever heard. ""I ain't gon' kill her"" (he must have pointed towards me) ""but I am gonna kill you."" I hear a gun go off, then running. I turn to look at my sister and there is blood coming from her head like a river. I'm slipping and sliding in my sister's blood trying to get her to wake up, because I know she can't be dead. She is dead. No one is on the street except us. I wake up crying."
"Marsha(A)-03"	"(1996-06-30)"	"#Marsha(A)-03 (1996-06-30) One night while Bob is over, I dreamt that we've reconciled completely and things are back to the way they were. The abortion is over and we have decided to give our relationship another chance. Upon returning from a nice picnic at the park, Bob takes me to a place that is unfamiliar to me. I don't know if we are still in the big nearby city. I'm thinking, ""he's going to ask me to marry him."" Bob asks me to sit down. The tone of his voice is beginning to alarm me. ""Marsha, I need to talk to you about us."" First he tells me why we can't be together and that we're both too obsessed with each other. He tells me that he's gone back to work for my brother Alex and that Alex wants him to leave me alone. All during this time I noticed that BobÃ•s eyes have a weird look to them, as though he were hypnotized. I am sick with anger, my brother has gotten to him! I am filled with fury, a burning rage has welled inside of me. I begin to exorcise the influencing demon (my brother) from Bob. I rebuke him in Jesus' name. I am so emotionally enraged that in my sleep I literally begin striking Bob (who is awakened by my blows to his neck)."
"Marsha(A)-04"	"(1996-07-09)"	"#Marsha(A)-04 (1996-07-09) I am at my grandmother's church, in the second pew, listening to my brother and cousin Joe sing a duet (this is unusual because they hate each other). After they finish, my brother comes to sit by me. The Reverend is preaching a good sermon and I get filled with the ""Holy Ghost"" (which is also unusual because I am not a religious person). I start to speak in tongues, I look over at my brother and begin to exorcise the demons from him saying, ""In the name of Jesus I rebuke you Satan."" Everyone in the church is looking at me in total shock. Roseanne, another cousin in the pew directly behind me, points to five chubby little white girls. ""Now you've made the skinheads mad."" Politely, I turn around to see if I've offended these girls, but the first four just smile at me bashfully. The fifth girl, also the chubbiest, scowls at me and murmurs a racial epithet (I can't remember what she said). Then I woke up feeling somewhat shaken."
