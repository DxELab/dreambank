    "description": "Dorothea lived from 1887 to 1965. This series of about 900 dreams covers the years from 1912 to 1965.  There are 54 dreams from ages 25 to 40 and 85 from ages 41 to 55.  She did not start writing down every dream until 1959, when she was 72.  Dorothea kept her dreams for her own personal reasons.  She was not in therapy and had no interest in the clinical theories of dreams developed by Freud, Jung, and others.  She did not write to Calvin Hall offering her dreams for study until a few years before her death.  (For more about this series, including the dreamer's own commentary on her dream journal, click here.)"
