"F01-1"	"None"	"#F01-1 I dreamed I was a the beach with my sister, sun-bathing, and next to me there was a girl whom I don't know in real life. Then we went to this girl's house and some boys came towards us and they threw water on us. And due to this I ran to my house and stayed there till my sister arrived and we went with our little cousins to the pastry shop to buy some cake."
"F01-2"	"None"	"#F01-2 I dreamed I was married to a very tall and fat man, with very hard features, and according to him I was hysterical so he was always doing experiments with me. The house in which we lived was very large with a lot of glass and big rooms with electrical appliances. One day I decided that I would try all those experiments he did on me, on him, to see their results. The results were that we both finished up for good, locked in rooms (separate) so that the doctors would cure us. But the strangest thing about the dream was that I wasn't dreaming this, but rather my sister was telling this story about one of her patients to me. When she finished her story, I met her and she told me that both of the sick people would stay until they were cured."
"F01-3"	"None"	"#F01-3 I dreamed about an unknown person who had a snake and that another person and I stole it. My father realized this and made us give it back, scolding us, but she didn't get upset. Then we went over to a place where they sold Coca-Cola and she ordered one and told me that she wanted to take the straws because where she lived they didn't have any. So we opened a box and put many straws in for her to take. All of this took place in the school I attended until I was 11, but it was in the recreation room of the older girls."
"F01-4"	"None"	"#F01-4 I dreamed about a friend and we were going by a record shop and listening to records. At that point an unknown boy appeared and I told him that my friend (M) had a record collection that he himself had recorded. Any every once in a while a big girl would appear wearing a very fancy tulle dress and she danced in front of me. I don't remember any more."
"F01-5"	"None"	"#F01-5 I dreamed I was at a beach and then a group of people started to walk on the rocks, and I did too. And we arrived at a beach where one could see the bottom of the ocean. Among the people were my parents. My father went down to the shore and swam, then a boy went down quickly and he got in the water wearing a towel and all and he came out and came up fast. Then I told my father that the tide was rising and it was best to leave, so we started to climb, but in order to go up we had to climb some stairs which were very tall and narrow and they were made of tiles and slippery. I remember that at the beginning I was helping my father and when he reached the top, I was left all alone and couldn't go up, and I asked him for help and he wouldn't help me. When I got to the top some people started to get there who said they were going to play golf and that this was the private beach of a club. I went up and walked to a very small white house that belonged to an aunt of mine. There, in that house, I met two girlfriends who told me that we should go to Ancon. They looked very pretty and when I looked in the mirror, I looked terrible and all my clothes were very dirty and I told them that I couldn't go like that, and they said it didn't matter."
"F01-6"	"None"	"#F01-6 I dreamed I was in an operating room where I had just had a baby, but I didn't feel any pain. They made me get dressed and I went out with my sister. We got to the elevator and there my sister met a boy who took us shopping, but before that, in the hospital we went to visit a lady who had also had a baby and was in a room with all her relatives. When we went shopping, the boy got off with my sister to buy bread and when he returned to the car, he greeted a friend of mine (M) who died last year. We met my aunts and they told my sister to take me to the hospital, because it might be harmful for me to be around. Before that I asked the boy to take me to a bookstore to buy a pen for a girlfriend. The salesman showed me how the pen worked in the store. I bought it and asked to have it gift-wrapped."
"F01-7"	"None"	"#F01-7 Another dream I had is that I dreamt that I was studying because I had to take an exam, and that I shouldn't awake because I still hadn't finished my studying (in my dream, of course, right?)."
"F01-8"	"None"	"#F01-8 I dreamed that I was being followed by a car driven by an unknown woman, everywhere. Each time I turned around, I would see the face of this woman. She never got off the car; she just observed me. Then I went on dreaming that I was walking and then I was climbing some very narrow stairs which led me to a school where there were unknown people, and when I had climbed the stairs, I turned around and I saw the stranger again, sitting in the car.\"
"F02-1"	"None"	"#F02-1 I dreamed that I made it a point to leave Nancy and Joe alone at a special moments so that they could speak about themselves. I ran to leave them behind. I took the first bus that came and I watched their happiness from afar. I was sad, though I don't know why."
"F02-2"	"None"	"#F02-2 I dreamt I was at the university with everybody and that they were going to give a party for me and I felt happy. Freddie (my ex-boyfriend) was looking for my friendship, but I didn't want to and Charlie (a friend) was telling me that I should accept him, and I threw him a notebook and with that, I awoke."
"F02-3"	"None"	"#F02-3 I dreamt I was in the classroom and the boys brought a mouse to bother people and they threw it at the girls. It fell on a black girl and she turned ashen from fright. Then they threw it at me and I grabbed Mary Ellen and I woke up."
"F02-4"	"None"	"#F02-4 I dreamt that I was asleep and dreamt that I had gone for a drive with Joe and his girlfriend. We went to the beach and I smeared myself with excrement. I don't know where it came from. Ann was disgusted and I cleaned myself with a paper and I threw up."
"F02-5"	"None"	"#F02-5 I had gone on a bus with two passengers. It was a number 42 bus. I saw the color of the bus, which was blue. I had several shoes with me which weren't mine, which I was going to deliver. Then I was crying along the way. Then I saw some sand hills and some land which wasn't producing. Then I came back and found some streets which looked like a housing development area. I found a woman and gave the shoes to her. Then I went back and awoke."
"F02-6"	"None"	"#F02-6 I was in an unfamiliar but pretty place. I was accompanied by two friends, Raul and Isaac. Freddie, my ex-boyfriend, had told Raul that he wanted to start a fight, but Raul had told him that that wasn't nice. Freddie had wanted to fight with him, because he felt in love with me and couldn't stand seeing me always accompanied by Isaac. Then I awoke."
"F02-7"	"None"	"#F02-7 I was walking on an unknown street when suddenly I saw my ex-boyfriend running towards me. Then he tripped and fell and then I didn't see him any more. I didn't attach any importance to this, because I felt nothing for him any more. Then I woke up."
"F02-8"	"None"	"#F02-8 I was in an unfamiliar place, in front of some mirrors. I looked at myself. Then my aunt, with whom I live at present, was there. There was a broken mirror on the floor and she picked it up and looked at herself. Then I awoke. There was no emotion."
"F03-1"	"None"	"#F03-1 My mother told me that I should go to someplace out of the city to learn something (I don't remember what). I went by car to a house in a  far-away place. On the way we passed through a road that went through a valley; the scenery was green. I got to a house that looked like a ranch, where I had to find an older woman. The house was not very nicely kept; it looked like it belonged to people without much money, though not poor. A man of about 21 years, or perhaps 18 or 19, opened the door for me. I was attracted to him. Then I saw myself going back home in another car and I arrived there at night. I believe the car was black."
"F03-2"	"None"	"#F03-2 It was a place which looked very much like the school I go to, first in a place where there was a stepladder and stairs going up to the second floor. Everything was painted white (the walls), the stepladder was dirty, and the stairs going to the second floor were painted green, but old and discolored; a door and a window on each side, dirty planks, etc. There was a woman who was trying on dresses. It was like a fashion show, but the place didn't seem appropriate; I observed this. There was a man of about 35 who was talking to a group of boys of about 10 to 17 years. Then it was another place. It was a classroom in school, very similar to the previous setting. In class we were talking to the teacher (I do know her and she teaches me Family Education, she is about 38) and I recognized several classmates. We were talking about dresses, materials and patterns, since we wanted to make them. I described a dress in a white material, with a zipper in the front and  a collar, sleeveless and with colored pockets. I said it was a dress for the beach. The people I recognized were the teacher and 2 or 3 classmates of about 15 or 16 years."
"F03-3"	"None"	"#F03-3 It went like this: I was invited to a party and my escort had given me the written invitation for me to keep. The day of the party arrived and my escort, who is a boy from my class, went to pick me up at my home and then the problems started. I couldn't find the invitation that we needed to go to the party and didn't know how to tell him. Then I saw myself with him, waiting in line, and with all my classmates too, in the school yard. He is a very shy and reserved boy and doesn't like parties."
"F03-4"	"None"	"#F03-4 I correspond with a boy from Venezuela. I dreamt that my letters didn't reach him because the address I had was incomplete. Then suddenly he traveled from Venezuela to Lima and arrived at my house. We hugged each other and he immediately asked for my hand and asked my parents for me in marriage. Then I was coming out of a house (very similar to the house of my aunt, but the street where it was located looked more like mine) and he and I were saying goodbye to all my family and friends. But I only saw the faces of my mother and my aunt (the one with the house) and they were wishing me happiness in my marriage. I was crying with joy. We left in a red sports car, he drove."
"F03-5"	"None"	"#F03-5 I remember vaguely that it deals with my friendship with a boy from the exchange program -- an American boy of about 18 years, blonde, with blue eyes and a very likable person. I believe, I am not sure, that he belonged to the group of students from the International Fellowship."
"F03-6"	"None"	"#F03-6 A young lady was asking me for a loan of ten thousand; this girl seemed to be a hairdresser (employed at the place where they do my hair). She told me that she needed the money and that I was the only person who could help her. We were in a room which seemed to be part of a building. The girl was behind a wooden counter. I was next to my father."
"F03-7"	"None"	"#F03-7 I only remember that I was walking downtown on some street with my brother and that we went to a movie. I remember that the name of the theater was ""Leandro."" Then I saw myself inside the theater, and it was filled with people."
"F03-8"	"None"	"#F03-8 The dream is about a party I had last night. I remember I was at the party with a classmate. I saw him, a boy of 17 years, and his cousin, 19 years, who always danced with me. I also saw the boy's house just as it really is. A hallway which is at the entrance was dark and I think the walls were painted green and the floor in red. There I was with my classmate's cousin. In the dream I was very happy, really having fun. I also saw myself dancing with all the boys who were attending the party. I saw my classmates who went to the party. They were playing fast music and the atmosphere was very gay; everybody seemed very happy."
"F04-1"	"None"	"#F04-1 I was at home. I had to go see Lillian, a friend who lives nearby, whom I had not visited in a long time, in spite of living so close to her house. I felt that I had to go see her when I was told that Lillian was calling me. She was in bed, sick. I answered that I would see her at once, but she let me know that since her mother had to go out, she would not be home, but in a grocery store across the street from where she lives. When I found out about this, I felt no desire to see her, or rather I thought I would see her anyway, but I felt frustrated, as though my special interest had been to go see her at her home. The dream ended there. Lillian is a classmate of mine. I know her since high school. She is seventeen or eighteen years old."
"F04-2"	"None"	"#F04-2 The surroundings were familiar. I was in my room with two of my siblings: Tony, the youngest of them all, and Tela, the second youngest. We started to have an argument. I don't know what the motive was. Tela wanted to scratch her stomach in front of Tony, and when I saw this, I scolded her. She reacted furiously and told me that why couldn't she do what she pleased. To show me how daring and independent she was, she took off her panties and stood half-naked in front of Tony and me. Then I reacted violently also and, wishing to punish her, I also took off my panties to hit her with them. This happened automatically. When I realized that Tony was present, I felt ashamed and looked for something with which to cover myself. I found some napkins, but they were too small and I continued to search until I found a larger one. Once I was covered, I went to punish Tela, who continued to be in the same condition, and then she threw her panties on my face. I caught her strongly in order to slap her, but my arms were not strong enough. Anyway, I did slap her some but not as I would have wished to do it. When my mother arrived, I told her everything, and when she found out that Tony had witnessed everything, she went looking for my sister, like mad, and I don't remember if she hit her, but she did tell her that she would never forgive her this and that as far as she was concerned, she was dead. I felt more calm once my mother had recriminated her. Tony is 12 and Tela is 14; my mother is 46. My relations with Tela are more or less tense because she always wants to prove that nobody can tell her what to do, and she does not care if we cry as long as she gets what she wants. I get along with Tony much better. He is willful and wants to do as he pleases also, but less frequently than Tela. My mother does not have the strength to correct us. This dream was not pleasant. At the end, Tela was silent. I felt upset because of what had happened and Tony did not do anything; he was just a spectator."
"F04-3"	"None"	"#F04-3 I remember this dream very vaguely: The surroundings were in the university. There were problems because things were being looked at from only one point of view. Then I presented another viewpoint which was totally opposed to the previous one to see if things would get better. The problems continued. Then I tried to get them over their opposition to each other by searching for unity, something intermediate."
"F04-4"	"None"	"#F04-4 Last night I dreamt of my sister Martha. We were in her bedroom talking a bit angrily, when she stepped backwards and, without realizing it, sat on the bed of my other sister where our cat (who is sick) had defecated. So Martha put her hand right where the cat had defecated and she let out a scream of disgust and surprise."
"F04-5"	"None"	"#F04-5 I dreamt that I was just about to buy a pair of suede shoes, but I did not trust the quality because I have the impression that with water and dirt they get ugly and are ruined. However, in the dream it turned out that somebody (I don't know if it was my sister Martha or my grandmother) had a pair of brown suede moccasins which were already a little worn, but due to time only because their quality was so good that you could wash them with soap and water and they would be like new. I remember that I was very enthusiastic and I asked her where she had bought them. (The surrounding of this dream was home, but I am not sure of whether it took place in the patio which is between our bedrooms.) At the end of the dream I felt great relief at having at last found a good pair of suede shoes."
"F04-6"	"None"	"#F04-6 I dreamt that a boy named Francis, whom I know only by sight and who went to our class yesterday to present a talk on his specialty (Economics), had gone to visit us at home. In our house we were celebrating I don't know which holiday, but not in the living room as it is usually done, but in the rear patio where not too long ago some old rooms had been torn down in order to start a garden in that place. It was a gay night. My uncles were laughing, drinking, and hugging each other, and I remember that I saw Francis among my uncles, a thing that surprised me, since it was the first time that I had seen him with them. My parents liked him very well, at least I heard some comments to that effect. Some pictures of this boy were taken and he got to take part in the general celebration. In the dream I was just a spectator and had a feeling of surprise and astonishment seeing him there; I asked myself what he was doing in our home."
"F04-7"	"None"	"#F04-7 I dreamt of two friends who often come to visit us: Richard and Mike. In the dream I was in the living room and suddenly Mike arrived. I think he came from the patio and I don't remember well what I told him, but he got defensive. Later, Richard appeared, but he was representing a person other than himself. They were questioning me indirectly about my boyfriend Danny (who was not present there), but I got upset at Richard's attitude because he was smiling ironically."
"F04-8"	"None"	"#F04-8 This dream is a short one: I dreamt that I was in a patio where there were whole rows of men's shirts. These shirts belonged to my cousin Ulysses (23 years old) and I, together with another person (I cannot say whether it was male or female because this person just appeared by my side without my ever looking at that person at any time), were trying to put them in order. I was thinking that there were too many shirts. It seemed strange to me that they were putting them in order so neatly folded and in rows, as though they were ready to be packed or put away. I think I told my opinion to my companion. While I was ordering the shirts in tall piles (more or less a yard high), I was kneeling and almost submerged among the pile of shirts."
"F05-1"	"None"	"#F05-1 My dream happened in the H. tunnel. I was with another person, a woman; it seems to me it was my mother, but I am not sure. We had to go through the tunnel, but it was closed on both sides by portals. Then we opened one of them and we started to walk and then to run because the bats' screams terrified me. I placed two objects, like books or notebooks, over my ears in order not to hear. I was afraid that they would bite me, especially my legs. At last we got to the other gate, and the person who was with me started to go out walking on her knees. I walked with my feet because the idea of kneeling on that floor was revolting to me. At that point I woke up."
"F05-2"	"None"	"#F05-2 I was walking with a girlfriend on a street by the sea, when the sea started to come out. When we had the water up to our knees, I told my friend that we should climb the wall that was on our right side so that we could go on walking, but then the water had completely covered the wall and we could not see where we were walking, when my friend slipped and fell into an abyss. But at the bottom of it there were people and she fell on top of a man. She did not die. I did not know what to do, so I started to walk and came across my sister and a friend and they led me through some walls where the water had not gone in, and when we were just about to get out of there, there was a great gust of wind. Then we got to the car and climbed in (my sister was driving). We got a flat tire, but we continued that way until we reached our home and we found our mother."
"F05-3"	"None"	"#F05-3 I don't remember the dream very distinctly. I took our car from my house and went toward some place. In order to park the car, I put down a metal support such as the ones that bicycles have. After going to several places, I came back home. I cannot remember anything else."
"F05-4"	"None"	"#F05-4 I was having a discussion. I don't remember who the people were; I think they were my classmates. I also can't remember what we were discussing. I only know that I became extremely heated, trying to make them see my viewpoint, and that finally I stood up, showing them that the discussion was over."
"F05-5"	"None"	"#F05-5 I dreamt that my boyfriend was kissing me, but suddenly he seemed to disappear and a fat guy dressed in the latest fashion, with a beard and sideburns, appeared and he was getting close to me in order to kiss me, and I was trying to get away from him because I did not like him. And people told me that fat men -- and this one especially -- were very good in marriage and in love. I had seen this figure, this man, and looked at him very closely at Mass on Sunday, and he was very fat. And what really called my attention was that his wife was very tiny and I pitied her for having such a fat and huge husband. That must have influenced my dream."
"F05-6"	"None"	"#F05-6 We had gone out for a walk at night. We were: a girlfriend, a little boy and myself. We were walking when suddenly we realized that we were being followed, that two men were the ones following us, and that, furthermore, they were policemen. They were a good distance behind us, so we got away by going through a series of little streets and we passed by several portals or iron gates. And we arrived at my girlfriend's house on the beach, and when we got there, we found her mother playing cards with some of her friends. We asked her if she had seen the policemen and she said that she hadn't, and then we went to hide. I don't remember any more."
"F05-7"	"None"	"#F05-7 I dreamt that I was having a very pleasant conversation with my psychology teacher at the university (he is very handsome). At some point he took my hand and kissed it, and I told him that he should not do that because all the girls were going to see us. I don't remember how the dream ended."
"F05-8"	"None"	"#F05-8 I dreamt that I had killed somebody, but I don't remember whom I had killed, nor how nor why I had killed him or her. Anyway, the dead person appeared later, but it was in a small container in the kitchen. When my sister came into the kitchen, I put a piece of plastic or a dish towel over the container so that she would not see it. My desperate concern was that she shouldn't see it."
"F06-1"	"None"	"#F06-1 I was with a group of people (I don't know who) in the house of an ex-classmate of mine. Everything was dark. We were sitting on the floor against the wall. Suddenly I found myself walking with people from the university by the school gate. We went into a place where there was an assembly, which looked like a movie theater. I was spending my time looking for my coat, without finding it. The people started to go and then the place was transformed into the house in which I lived up to five years ago, and we were sitting there, around a table. One of the girls said that it was already late (""five o'clock"") and something about a mass. Everything was still dark. One of the boys was my boyfriend (he is really the boyfriend of a friend of mine). I was going with them up to the door, and when we were saying goodbye, I was very surprised that he did not kiss me. When I passed by the living room, I saw it all lit up and there were 6 or 8 people talking."

There were more people, but I did not know them. Later I was with the same girl in an old bus on the Southern Highway. We were going by a place with a sign that said ""Exhibit Club"" and I, trying to think of where that name came from, was slow in getting off the bus. We went down and we started to walk. It was sunny. At the end, wit the same girl and two boys from the university, we were in the living room of my old home. It was somewhat dark. They were dancing, and I was kneeling by a couch, laughing."
"F06-4"	"None"	"#F06-4 I was with my sister in her fiance's car going by a park. It was nighttime. She gave me the wheel and I started to drive; the car was very hard.

Every one of them was very calm, laughing. I was talking with one of them and we agreed to meet later on."

Naturally, after the game there were boys and girls, and one of the boys grabbed some girl and said, ""This is ..."" and he said a name and even an address and telephone number. Then I was someplace with a lady and she pointed to a dog and told me that this was a domestic animal, and then she would say that this animal was from the mountains and so on. She kept classifying them according to what she thought. This happened at my university and I was alone, although there were some girls that I knew. The boys and girls were of approximately my same age, that is between 18 and 20 years. This dream is indifferent. I neither dislike it nor like it."

We were looking for a place in which to rest and after walking for a while, we discovered a very big fall which impressively fell into a small river. I was the one opposed to it and urged them to take another road, until we found something like a canyon with a beautiful house, with a lake that looked like a calm pool. From there we could see the falls. I dreamed that all of us were quickly settled in different rooms to continue during the day. We went through the house, which was full of rooms, keys on the doors, corridors that were lit but filled with mystery. Suddenly I saw that the dam had broken and that water from the falls is running wildly. Panic sets in among the people. I forced them to get on the tallest part which is a wall, their legs are hanging and the water is inches away. I remember the position of the nuns. The three nuns were sitting together and hanging on to the one in the middle, making it impossible for her to get to me. After that three girls, two boys, myself next to my best girlfriend and then a nun who is an intimate friend of my friend and then people. A white cable arrived and we were told that they were coming to rescue us. In order to celebrate, I grabbed the hand of the nun who was in between the two who wouldn't let her move and we jumped into the water, swimming and laughing happily. I don't remember any more."

Instead, seeing her caused me to be surprised and we greeted each other by saying hello. I was always rather distant with her, especially since I got to know her better and found out that she wasn't good for a friend.

I was speaking to him very calmly and telling him that he shouldn't worry about his hands shaking or about people and what they would think  when they saw him like that. He told me that he wasn't worried about that, but about the fact that if the disease progressed, he wasn't going to be able to write. Then I gave him a notebook and made him practice with his left hand so that if the right hand didn't work well, he could write with the other. I was also telling him that the disease became more pronounced at the age of 70 or 80 and that he shouldn't worry because he was still young, and that he should enjoy life and see it from a different viewpoint; that is, I was trying to raise his spirits.

"F22-1"	"None"	"#F22-1 A group of friends from the neighborhood were standing at the corner of my house, waiting for somebody. We were going on a picnic. A week ago we had a picnic and while we waited in the dream, I had the feeling that things were being repeated. I was among my friends. I knew they were my friends, even though I didn't see anyone in particular. We were simply together. Suddenly Louie, who is known to all of us and, like us, is a member of the Circus Club, arrived in a car. His car was very dirty and he always has it clean. He is a boy I don't like very much, even though I don't know him well. We all got in the car, and I automatically thought that there were more girls than guys (in the picnic it had been the other way). I was in the back of the car. When I had thought that, Louie was changed into a girl and at that point my dream ended."
"F22-2"	"None"	"#F22-2 Then I dreamt a different thing, very complicated. Instead of living in a house, we lived in an apartment (father, mother, sister -- 17, brother -- 13) and my father was already very old. He didn't look like my father, but I had the feeling I was the daughter of that man. Suddenly I saw myself sitting in the car with another person. I don't know who it was; I only remember I felt I was with somebody. But at the same time, I felt I was his daughter. I felt like a friend of that family because I was asking my father about everyone's health. He told us that his wife was in her room with arteriosclerosis and that he was taking care of her (my mother is a young and healthy person). Then he touched on the problem he had of a daughter who was very much in love with an indecent doctor and that she didn't know this and couldn't say no to him. He also loved her, but in a very peculiar way. I remember I saw both of them in a hospital. She was crying and scolding him, blaming her own weakness. Then I saw them going into the apartment and she had made up her mind not to see him any more. Everything was very confused because at the same time I identified myself with the friend in the car, with the daughter, such as I am, and with the daughter about whom the father was talking, but the things he told me were like things in a movie and she is physically different from me and older. After this I awoke."
"F22-3"	"None"	"#F22-3 It was a very short dream. A friend of my mother's and of the family has just come back from a vacation in Mexico and the U.S.A. She just arrived yesterday and in my house we were commenting on her trip. I dreamt that she had arrived and that her youngest son, who is 2, didn't recognize her, and cried. She is 38 and we were all in her house, which is a large and pretty house. However, all of us were in the kitchen, which was small, and we were watching the child crying and not wanting to go near her. And while I was observing them, I was wondering what she had brought me as a present."
"F22-4"	"None"	"#F22-4 Just yesterday we had a telephone installed in our house. Well, I dreamt the same thing, that they were installing a telephone, but everything happened at nighttime. Once they had installed the telephone, my sister and I were very happy and we went out to go to the house across the street where a couple of old people live. They love us very much and they had let us use their telephone. They live with a servant. Anyway, my sister and I went out, but when we were going to cross the street, I was completely alone and it was 2 a.m and everything was dark. When I was across the street, I saw Ronald with bandages on his head and he told me that he had had an accident (yesterday afternoon he had a slight one). Anyway, I felt dreadful and I started to talk to him lovingly as I did when he was my boyfriend. He was also nice to me and we kissed, but I realized that it was nighttime and that we were on the street in front of my house, and that my father might appear at any time. And besides, I had to go and thank the people for the use of the phone. So I quickly got away from him and when I looked at the house of the people, it had changed entirely; it was dark, ugly, dilapidated and dirty, with a huge garden and very old door. They were looking at us from the window (they are always doing that). I went up the stairs and anxiously asked Ronald whether we would see each other the next day. He answered vaguely that we might and went on to his house. The door was opened for me; the maid, who is very nice, looked very different. The lady looked the same (she's fat and drunk), but at the same time there was another one who was also her, but who looked like a witch, with a long, dirty robe. I didn't want to go in, but they insisted and I didn't want to offend them. I timidly thanked them for their kindness and wanted to leave for home in a hurry, but instead of seeing the door, I kept seeing depressing rooms with Ronald inside. I got out quickly and when I was in the street, I saw my dog, who was barking, and I kept calling him, but he didn't pay attention to me. And then I don't know what happened. I remember only vague things, like a sunny garden where I was and at the same time I was breathing the fresh morning air, that is, dawn. That humid quality of dawn mixed with the smell of the tree that the family has at the entrance of their home. I felt that fragrance and the disappointment over the coolness with which Ronald had treated me and I was comparing his attitude with the one he used to have about me."
"F22-5"	"None"	"#F22-5 I fell asleep again thinking of the nice dream I had had and I dreamed something different. I dreamed that I and my family were in a strange country. A cousin of mine, who is 22 and who went to Bolivia with us last year, was also there. Anyway, we were lodged in some kind of horrible apartment. It was dirty and we cleaned it with water. There was even blood and it didn't come out. We decided to leave that and return to our country. Coming out of that, we had to go through a labyrinth of dead-end streets, which were dirty and stank (my father, mother, siblings and cousin). We were able to get out of that horrible city and we started to go towards the frontier. Once there (we were in a car), they wouldn't let us through without going through a great deal of red tape that my father had overlooked. At any rate, we had to turn around halfway there and it was nighttime and it was in the country and the road was very narrow. My father suggested that we hide underneath the seats so that if anyone went by, they would only see two people, but one of them was fat. I don't know who she was, but there she was and it was difficult to get her under the seat. We arrived at the border and when we had almost gone through, they stopped us again so that my father would pay a certain sum of money. Then I got furious and jumped out of the car to scream at them and hit these men who were seated behind a table, like judges. They didn't wear uniforms. They were rather old men. I even wanted to hit one of them, and at that moment my dream ended."
"F22-7"	"None"	"#F22-7 It has been a very confused dream and I don't remember very well. It seems that some scenes from the previous day have been repeated. The only thing I remember is that I was at a beautiful beach, in some sort of room which overlooked the ocean. Anyway, I had to study and I was sitting at a desk in front of the sea waiting for my best friend and classmate, Nelly, to arrive. We always study together; she is 18 and we love each other very much. She arrived and there were also other people whom I don't remember. We sat at the desk and when we were starting to study, a very large picture of a whole group of girls from my school appeared in my hand. The picture was old and we looked very different, and we laughed for a good while and a lot of classmates I thought I'd forgotten came to my mind. I knew that time was running and was getting ready to start studying again when -- I don't know why -- all of us went outside. We went down some wooden stairs and stood looking at the ocean. I felt great emotion looking at the ocean. Then we all went up to study again and I desperately felt that the time was running. but to my great surprise, I saw that all our notebooks were gone. We went down to look for them and everyone found theirs except me. I was desperately asking around and nobody knew where mine was. A little ways from there, there was another beach and I went there, but it wasn't there either, and I asked a fat girl about it (she was in a swimming suit) and she pointed towards some hats. And I got upset and told her that I wasn't looking for that. I was desperately aware of the time running out and all the rest were already studying, when suddenly I saw Ronald in front of me and he asked  me what my problem was, and I explained to him what was happening and he also started to search, but I told him I had already done that. When I raised my eyes, I saw another shore on the other side of the ocean and one could clearly see Ronald's car. I started to sigh and said that perhaps my notebook was in that place. As soon as I said that, he jumped in the water with clothes and all and started to swim (he does it very well). The fat girl and I stayed on the shore waiting. I continued to observe the beauty of the sea. She asked me who that boy was, and I told her that she would see that later. Ronald came back in his car over the water and when he arrived, he came to me and took my hand with great love and told me that it wasn't there either. Then I started to cry and wail and he tried to encourage me. Then I looked at the fat girl (unknown) and asked her if she already knew who he was and she answered that she did, with a knowing gesture. I don't remember any more, but I did continue to dream a lot of confused and outstanding things."
"F22-8"	"None"	"#F22-8 Then another situation. We (I and a group) were in a car which I was driving, but I don't remember the way it was or who was with me. Anyway, we were on a small road surrounded by trees and we were singing because we were going to a club. The club had two entrances. One was next to the road where there was a cliff and a bridge which led to the club which was facing the cliff, and for the other entrance, one had to go around a long way in order to get in with the car because the bridge couldn't hold cars. We thought we would leave the car in front of the bridge and then go over the bridge. I was thinking whether it would support the weight of all of us. When we got to the place, there was a car in the same spot and we were furious because we didn't plan on finding anything there. We got off and there were some women. After asking them to move their car, they screamed at us because we became foul-mouthed while at the same time secretly realizing that they were right, because if they went over the bridge, it would break, but they also didn't want to leave us any room to leave our car with theirs. They were all dressed in black and when we got in the car, angrily, thinking about the long way we'd have to drive, one of the ladies called me by name and in a panic, I recognized that it was my great aunt (my father's aunt) whom they call Aunt Nona. She was very affectionately coming to greet me and I, terribly scared, started the car and we left the place."
"F23-1"	"None"	"#F23-1 We were in a speech class. The teacher was a well-known professional in the field of psychology. In this class each one of the students had to expose a theme that would attract general attention. First it was Mary Ann's (a classmate) turn. She did it very well and was applauded by the audience. The second one to speak was a boy named Edgar (also a classmate, very intelligent, cultured and able, whom I admire especially). He spoke brilliantly about Sophocles's tragedies. Then it was Louise's turn (a friend and classmate). She spoke alright, but was not able to narrow down her topic very well. Afterwards, Roland (a quite intelligent classmate) exposed his topic. I don't remember well what he spoke of or how well he did it. The fifth one to speak was Cindy (a friend and classmate, an intelligent and quite studious girl). But something strange happened with her, because instead of exposing a theme, the same as the others, she began to hum a song and to sing and dance. Together with her performance she presented another great number: it turned out that this girl had the power to transform herself into birds of multi-colored plumage and butterflies of extremely beautiful colors; besides she could transform her surroundings, changing the lighting. I believe it would be hard for me to explain the beautiful picture I had before my eyes. At last Cindy finished her performance and was applauded most of all. The last one to present a theme (which was I) did not fare so well. First, I did not know whether to give a talk or sing as the one before me had done. Finally, I decided on the latter, but in the meantime, the auditorium had been emptied, and the only ones left listening were Louise, the teacher, and Roland. In short, I was in a ridiculous situation, but I did not care and continued to sing until the end. Louise came over and started to make some criticisms; I was silent and accepted it. Going out, I tried to find Cindy. Once I found her I asked to explain how she had acquired those wonderful gifts. Cindy told me that it was Saint Martin who had given them to her. I continued to ask whether it was the black saint or Jose de San Martin. It was the latter who had given her those gifts as compensation for the effort that Cindy made in her studies and for having an altruistic spirit. But before this Cindy told me that to get in touch with San Martin, one had to go to the cemetery and stand watch by his grave all night. I thought that it was all a fantasy, an realizable dream, but perhaps it could turn into reality. I would give it a try and go to the cemetery and stand watch by the grave of San Martin."
"F23-2"	"None"	"#F23-2 I had gone to visit my father. On the way I passed by a narrow street and suddenly I found that my father appeared out of I don't know where, but anyway, he started to talk to me about his present financial situation. He said he would have to leave his job, his business, because I did not give him any money and, besides this, a series of bills to be paid appeared from everywhere. Then he suggested that I should do the same thing he would do after leaving his business, i.e., look for another job. I answered him that I had already thought of that and had applied for a part-time job. They would give me the answer within two weeks. I do not remember well what followed this dream, but I believe that the dream was a product of a conversation my brother and I had on the previous night. He told me that my father had written him a letter saying that he would not be able to send us our money allowance because his business was not making any money, and that, therefore, my brother should assume all the financial responsibility for our home. While my brother and I were talking about this, I kept thinking that I would have to get a job to help in some way. As can be observed, my dream was nothing but a product of the impression that my conversation with my brother had on me."
"F23-3"	"None"	"#F23-3 I dreamt that my brothers and I had gone out to scale some mountains (Aurelio is the oldest and he is 22 years old, then comes Mark, who is 20). When the three of us were about to reach the top of the mountain, I slipped and started to fall, yelled, asking for help. My brothers did not know what to do. I continued to fall and scream and simply would not reach the ground. Suddenly something unusual happened: I started to fly, moving my arms as though they were wings, and little by little I got away from those mountains. In the meantime, my brothers were calling me desperately. I flew above a huge ocean of crystalline blue waters. Suddenly I was before a huge, long bridge which led to a strange city. I wanted to get to the city walking, but I could not do it until there appeared by my side a boy of about 27 or 28 years (his face was identical to that of a friend of mine), who led me by another bridge to the same mysterious city. In that city I found my mother who, on seeing me, started to shed tears and to kiss me. The boy who had accompanied me had disappeared. I cannot remember what followed."
"F23-4"	"None"	"#F23-4 I dreamt I was in another planet, fighting against its inhabitants (it was truly a disagreeable dream). The floor of that planet was multicolored and had a jello-like consistency in some parts and a compact consistency in others. At the beginning it was I alone who fought those beings of green faces and shining eyes, but then other earthlings who came to help me appeared. I am going to try to describe how the fight went: the strange creatures had set a goal mark for us; if we reached it, they would pardon our lives, but we were on the losing side anyway because we did not know how to reach the goal mark, which was an enormous building at the end of a corridor. The creatures chased us continuously with their weapons; they shot one of my comrades, and when he was hurt, he began to sink into the floor and was finally swallowed by it. They continued shooting their strange weapons and we started to do the same. They almost got me, but fortunately I was saved. Afterwards I had gotten to the house of an old lady (of unknown features) to ask her to let me use her bathroom, and then to rest a while. The lady looked at me suspiciously and hardly let me use her bathroom. When I came out of the bathroom, she accused me of having stolen her treasure and she would not let me go. I don't know how I escaped, but I then found myself again fighting with the strange creatures. Among the people who were with me, I did not recognize any friends or acquaintances."
"F23-5"	"None"	"#F23-5 I was in a small subterranean city. Inside this city there were houses, buildings, cafes, restaurants, etc. First I was taking some refreshments with some friends: Agnes (a friend, Psychology student); Amery (classmate and friend); Louise (friend and classmate). There were two more boys whose faces I did not recognize. The owner of the café was a boy named Ernest (a fellow worker of my mother), who had something against me. After finishing the refreshments, we came out of the café, and each one went his own way. I was still terribly hungry, and since I had no money, I had to go back to the café and steal two sandwiches. Ernest realized that I stole them and he started to chase me. I don't remember how I evaded him, but suddenly I found myself walking beside Agnes. I was telling her what had happened and was trying to justify my bad action by telling her of the hunger that I had felt at that moment. Behind us there was a boy whose face I did not know, who had a penetrating glance and blue eyes. He listened to all that Agnes and I were saying. Ernest, who had disappeared from the scene, reappeared, infuriated, in front of us. He kept on chasing me. I ran and ran until I could no longer run and I let myself be stopped by some policemen who were nearby. They told me that I had committed an unforgivable offense and that they would give me a death sentence. Suddenly the boy who had been following Agnes and me appeared and stated that my theft had not been voluntary, but rather motivated by the hunger I had felt. He made them see that they would have done the same thing under similar circumstances and that, therefore, it would not be fair to put me in jail. In spite of his speech, which was very convincing, he was not able to make them let me go. Desperate, I was able to run to the main exit of that small city, which led into a more highly developed one. In order to cross the threshold it was necessary for me to climb over steep terrain and avoid being caught by the policemen. Little by little I climbed until I finally arrived at the other city. Everything seemed to be more full of life, there was much more happiness. There were children who laughed openly, and lovers strolling through the green and flowery fields."
"F23-6"	"None"	"#F23-6 The dream took place in the old locale of the university. All of us students were in this building making a collection of money, food and medicines for the people hurt in the earthquake of May 31st I was in a room where they were packing clothes and food. There were several boys and girls. Among the boys that I knew were Biondi and Edwards (they are two students, of Education and Literature, very good friends -- Chela likes Biondi, and Ed is the boy that I am attracted to, somewhat). The four of us - Ed, Biondi, Chela and I - were making packages and singing. Afterwards the boys started to say goodbye. Biondi wanted to kiss me, but then he changed his mind. Ed did kiss me on the forehead. I felt happy and did the same thing. They told us that they would return later bringing us a refreshment, and would continue with the work. Then I appeared alone (because the above-mentioned boys were not there any more) standing in line to make a phone call. I started a conversation with my neighbors, but later I left them because I had become aware of the presence of Gabriel (classmate, very intelligent seminarian, whom I highly admire and appreciate -- he has the same last name that I do, so that I regard him as though he were a cousin of mine). I went towards Gabriel and we began to talk about the reaction that our tragedy had had abroad, about the show of solidarity from all Peruvians, etc. Finally I appeared in a hospital, helping the sick and the victims of the earthquake, when all of a sudden a mental patient came to me and stuck a thick needle in my wrist. He pulled it out immediately afterwards, without letting me react, and left. I was horror-struck; however, blood was not coming out. I left that room to look for a doctor who is a friend of mine (Charles, a boy who studies humanities, the same as I -- sometimes he flirts with me). When Charles saw me, he immediately came to me and told me that I should be home. He wanted to accompany me to my home. I refused, but he insisted. On the way we found my Uncle Gustav (he is like a father to me -- I admire him very much for the way he thinks and acts, and especially for his philosophy of life). The three of us headed for the bus stop."
"F23-7"	"None"	"#F23-7 I dreamt of a terrible tremor. I only know I felt it in my house. I was talking to my mother in the living room when suddenly we began to hear a terrible noise, the noise of earthquakes. We looked at each other, quite scared. The house was starting to crumble and some pieces of brick and glass fell over my body. I was badly hurt. Immediately I went to the hospital; there the doctor (who was around 30 years old and had the same face as that of a psychologist I know and often talk to), started to cry when he saw me, probably due to the terrible state I was in. I felt faint. I was losing lots of blood, and I begged the doctor -- who so far had just stood there looking at me -- to operate on me. While the doctor treated me, I was biting my lips to the point where they were bleeding, so that I would drown the cry of pain coming out of my throat. Once the treatment had been done, the doctor asked me how the accident had occurred. I told him what had happened and added that I did not want to go back home because my mother would be waiting for me, angry, and that she would get even angrier when she saw me with my arms and shoulders bandaged. I began to cry. The doctor probably took pity on me and told me that there was nothing to worry about because he himself would take me home and speak to my mother. We got to my home, which was dark, and when we were talking to my mother I felt that I had some resentment against her. But later she was very nice to me and told the doctor that she would take care of me. Starting on that day, I dedicated myself exclusively to reading -- books were my life. I had read and meditated so much that my head started to develop (physically) and the time came when it got so big that, bit by bit, it began to disintegrate. The pieces started to take the shape of an enormous book. My mother appeared, crying, next to the doctor. He consoled her and told her that everything was for my own good and for the good of everybody. My mother was still crying. I felt anguished."

When she saw me, she came to me and told me that the father of my mother's friend had died and they were having a wake for him. (My mother's friend has two siblings - Nelly and Serge -- and a father of a rather advanced age. Serge is 27 years old. I met him at a party where he asked me to go steady and I definitely refused). I did not know whether to go in and offer my sympathy to my mother's friend because I was afraid to see her brother. At last I decided that the correct thing to do was to stop by their house and accompany them in their sorrow. I was very well received (I felt very good about this) and I offered my sympathy to all the relatives of the deceased. Suddenly I realized that Serge was isolated in a corner, crying. I felt so sad, seeing him in this situation, that I went over to him in order to console him. At first he refused me, but then he told me that I was the only love he had left in the world, and that if I left him, he would commit suicide. At that moment I felt obliged to say yes to him, but after a while I reacted and told him the truth: I was not in love with him; I just loved him dearly, as one loves one's brother, and that I would help him to find a girl who would really love and understand him. Afterwards, I appeared walking through the building. I found that they had painted and renovated it. It looked new. I felt satisfied because I had been the one with the idea to fix up the house."

We were all in the bathroom when an elderly gentleman came in and I left the bathroom and was talking to some friends.Then the girl's mother came out saying that the girl had killed the gentleman and her father (? he had not been in the bathroom).

I felt very scared because I could not find them. Suddenly we went back to Cuzco. I went to change my clothes and I saw the jewels hidden underneath the bed. I could not explain to myself how they had gotten there."

The seats were kind of like blue sofas, there were lots of people, and they would not charge for the seats on the right-hand side of the theater. But I did not feel comfortable, and I told my friend that we should change places, but we didn't. Next to us there was a great big sofa, which was taller than the one we were in, and I saw with amazement that the sofa was transformed into a roller coaster, the same as the ones they have at amusement parks."

When I saw them turning the corner, I hurriedly ran and told my friend to wait for me; before he had asked me to go to the cleaners with him and it was just when I told him to wait for me that he went to take the car out. When I got to the corner, I saw that Louis (that is his name) was coming out of the garage in a light blue car with the same girl he was with before, and they were leaving, and they made a turn the wrong way on a one-way street. At that moment I started to run, not the same way they had gone, but rather I took a shortcut which went straight. I must have run for about two blocks and I did not see them any more, but as I kept advancing, the place became more unfamiliar, there were trees and few people."

In the back of the garden that belonged to my grandparents' apartment there was something (I don't remember what) hanging from I don't know where. A classmate from the university was in the next apartment with his parents, and in the other one there was a gentleman, who I suppose was with his wife, since there was a double bed (she never appeared in the dream). The garden where ""that"" was became filled with boys and girls (youths) and everyone was looking at it. Some were coming and some were leaving. After a while, the only ones still in the garden were a small group of people which included my university classmate (he, in reality, has the same last name that I have). I was the only girl there; all the others were boys. One of them brought down the ""thing"" and I believe (I don 't remember well) that he started to move from one side to another and then to destroy it. I remembered just now! At the beginning the thing that everyone came to admire was a strange flower, but the thing that the boy brought down was no longer the flower. At the end it destroyed itself and each person went his way in the most normal manner. Between apartments there were curtains instead of walls, so that I  could see my classmate sitting down at the table, taking a plate and serving some salad for himself. My grandparents and my dad asked me what had happened (they had seen everything from the apartment), but I don't remember what I answered them, and I woke up.

They got off there because their house was at that stop, and I got off in order to get home from there. They waited until my bus came and saw me get on it. I thanked them very much. It so happened that my brother was in that other bus. We got off and were standing by a lamppost when a couple of Arabs caught us and took us to their ""camp,"" which was nearby. We went in, deathly afraid, and found people doing Chinese or Japanese exercises (something like karate). After their practice, they grabbed me, lifted me, and wanted to take my clothes off with a sword. The guy who was going to do this, i.e., the one with the sword, did not look like an Arab. He had clear eyes and the features of a white man. He was very good-looking. He did not do it, and I don't know how, but I was able to escape. The two doors were opened, and I came out running and nobody followed me. but then I found a group of 3 or 4 who forced me to get back. I spent all the time with the one who was white. He was very nice, and he told me that he really wasn't an Arab, but that he had joined them because he liked their way of life. We went up on a roof to a point where we could look on the whole ""camp"" from up high, but they did not see us because some pieces of material were covering us. Afterwards we came down, and the people there, including my friend, started packing their things to leave. They didn't look at me like a stranger any more. I asked him what was going on and he pointed with his finger towards a fire and told me they were going elsewhere.

It was noon, sunny, and there were lots of people at the stadium. I was with my father, mother, and sister and couldn't understand my excitement at that moment because I do not like soccer too well. Nevertheless, I was cheering our team. The minutes were passing by and the game was very exciting. Suddenly, I don't know how, I saw the dining room at my house where I was listening to the game on the radio. It must have been 3 or 4 in the afternoon and there was no sun, and I was alone with my sister. The game continued to be exciting, when I saw a newspaper and took it and started glancing through it. When I saw a photo of a U.S. rock group, I looked at them intently; their faces seemed very expressive. It seemed a very clear picture or a mirror reflecting their image directly. The picture seemed to have been taken at a performance because it looked like they were singing. After looking at the picture, I got the impression of having gone inside it, because I found myself in a theater, big, full of lights, with a huge red curtain which opened immediately, and I could see the rock group on the stage. The lights were turned off and the spotlights went on. They were very brightly colored in red, blue, yellow, green -- the members of the group were dressed in black with colored accessories. They were dressed as ""hippies,"" had long hair and they all moved too much. The leader made gyrations with each of his screams. The sound was strident, although at times the music seemed sweet and melodic, but then the loud sounds were repeated. They were doing a very long song, and then I was told that the members of the group had taken drugs before the performance, which made me nervous, but I calmed down when I realized that I was with three friends of mine (I don't remember anything about them; they were girls) that I was not alone, but I had the idea that the police would be getting there any minute.

"F27-2"	"None"	"#F27-2 I dreamt that I was in a very old and dilapidated hospital which I did not know, and nobody came to visit me there. The other patients got lots of visits; their relatives went there and brought them food, magazines, and stayed with them a long while. The other patients and their relatives looked strangely at me. I got the impression that they did not want to get close to me. I couldn't understand this. I was alone, sad, and did not know how to get out of that situation. I knew that I could ask the people around me for help or try to communicate with them, ask them why they had that attitude. I understood this, but something seemed to stop me from doing it. I could not speak; however, I was not quite desperate because it made me happy to see the other patients talk among themselves, smile and wait for visiting hours. Every once in a while I would react to what was happening to me and I would look at the other patients, and try to catch their attention, making gestures. I would move back and forth in the bed, but since they did nothing about it, I felt like crying, but I controlled myself. Then a nurse appeared, and when she saw me like that, she looked at me mysteriously, and came back after a while with a shot which I did not want her to give me. I tried to defend myself, but she grabbed my arm with strength and gave me the shot. I think I fell asleep, but not too soundly because I heard noises of metal instruments being handled and I did not want to open my eyes. I heard voices whispering, men's and women's voices. I can't tell what they were saying, but an authoritarian voice said, ""To the room,"" ""To the operating room!"" It must have been the voice of a doctor. I felt that my bed was being moved. I wanted to speak, but could not do it, so I tried to move, but I was numb. I kept hearing voices, among them I recognized my mother's, so I wanted to make a big effort to speak to her. I was going to open my mouth and I saw a shadow in front of me. More or less at that point, I awoke. Surroundings: the hospital room where I was, was white, but there were cobwebs in the corners, everything was dusty, and the ceiling, walls and floor were cracked. The patients wore white and blue striped gowns, the beds and beddings were white. I did not know any of the patients, except I could tell they were older than myself. The same goes for their visitors."
"F27-3"	"None"	"#F27-3 My dream begins at 11 a.m. (closing time) on a Saturday, when I was in school. I was in a classroom with a group of friends, hearing a reprimand from the principal, who was telling us that due to the lack of discipline, we would have to stay until 2 p.m. We stayed in the classroom, supervised by a proctor. My friends and I made fun of her, telling her that since she had to stay with us until 2, she was also being punished. I felt very, very happy because I knew that my boyfriend (at that time) was coming to pick me up; he was a cadet and when he got out, he always went to my house and if he did not find me there, he would go to my school. My friends and I were talking about our courses. I was a senior. We were telling jokes and talking about the parties to which we went, until the time came when they let us out. And, as I expected, my boyfriend picked me up and we left arm in arm. I was very happy next to him, but afraid to run into my father because both he and my mother couldn't stand my boyfriend because of their dislike of the military. I remembered that each time my father saw me with him, he would say to me, ""Let this be the last time that I see you with that cadet!"". And he got worse every time, so I was afraid we might run into him and that he would embarrass us. I told my boyfriend that they had punished us, and he said to me what he had once told me, ""They punish me at the Academy, so it's about time they punish you too."" He was smiling when he said this, and we kept on walking. Suddenly I saw a big green car coming rather fast, and then I got scared. I looked quickly at the car and saw my father and other gentlemen (whom I did not know) in there, so I let go of my boyfriend and started running, and I saw him turn and look at the car, and he started running behind me. I was running as fast as I could, but he caught up with me and stopped me. I started to run again because I had turned around and seen my father with a gun, and he started to shoot. I was so nervous I couldn't run any more, and very tired, and I fell. When I was about to fall, my boyfriend caught me by the shoulder, but I had fallen already, as though I had fainted. Then it seems to me that I did not dream for a while, but later I was in my bedroom with my sister and she was saying to me, ""It's nothing. It's over now."" And she repeated this several times. I felt hurt all over my body, and then I remembered about what had happened and about my boyfriend and asked about him, and she told me that he was alright in the Academy and asked me whether he was going to come Saturday. And I got the impression that she was lying to me, but I was too tired to talk and I let her go because she was about to leave. My mother came in to heal my knee, which was injured, and I sat up and saw that it was injured and it stung and hurt me. Then I wanted to ask my mother about what had happened. I looked at her and was going to do it when I realized that she did not like the military, and I did not tell her anything, but at that point I woke up."

We said hello and she asked me where my sister was, and I told her that she could not come and that I was there to take the test for her. The girl laughed a lot and told me that it was really going to be something since I knew nothing about medicine. But I was not nervous. I kind of had the impression that it was all a game or that we were going to be given some psychological test to take. The classroom was very large. I think it was the largest in the school.

I went in and asked how much it cost and whether they had it in my size, and the salesgirl told me that it cost $20, but they did not have it in my size (in that color) and that she did not think that they were going to get a dress like that.

A curious and important thing is that the three of us were younger than we are. I was between 11 and 12 years old and was wearing a dress I had when I was that age, and my mother and my sister also were wearing dresses they used to have when I was about that age.

My aunt and uncle and my cousins were also younger. All of us cousins were playing and we made lots of noise, even though I don't remember the exact words we were saying. Suddenly I saw myself alone and the garden looked so huge that it seemed to be the jungle. The trees were very tall and there was a lot of green. There were huge banana trees and in front of them I looked even smaller in size. I was alone. There was a breeze and the evening was coming; the sun was starting to set. I walked aimlessly.

A group of friends of ours had invited us to a very nice restaurant that I know. They were giving a dinner party in our honor. People were greeting us and I got to see a table decorated very nicely with delicious food. I did not look at the locale too much, but it was big and elegant. It was nighttime. That is all I remember.

There were dogs and people with their children on the dock, fishing. Suddenly night came and the tide started to rise. It rose so much that we all woke up and tried to run. At that point the waves got so high that they inundated the bridge with great strength. Many people fell off the bridge and drowned. My fiancé started to jump on the rock because he was at a lower height than we. We shouted for him to come up, but he could not do it due to the waves. The waves hit that rock furiously, and I was desperately shouting for him to come up, and then he slipped while jumping and blood was coming out of his knees. It was very cold and we couldn't get out of that place. In the meantime we could see beds and houses floating in the water against the rocks. There was a terrible noise. We were all terrified. People screamed and cried. When the tide lowered, we were able to get down and we got in the car, after walking quite a bit. On the way back home I remembered that I had a party (maybe the shower party I did not go to the other day) and asked them whether they could stop. I went in and ate a lot and took some food out for the others. Then we continued on our way and arrived at another beach. I was deathly afraid that the same thing would happen to us there, but this place seemed safer. This place had houses around it and gardens. But just as in the other place, the sea came up and we started to run towards the highway. The waves started to flood the houses and many people were running and screaming, even though nothing happened to anybody. Only the things inside the houses were lost."

I kept talking to her and I could hear through the phone that there were lots of people at her house. I remember this because I could hardly hear her voice on the phone. It seemed that her brother was not there because everybody kept calling him and nobody would answer. Therefore, I could not say hello to him. Then I dreamt that on the same day I had my sewing class, which is generally on Thursdays, though that day was a Monday. I had not done the assigned homework because I had not had the time (I want to point out that the other day I was not able to do the homework for my sewing class). I dreamt that the girl who teaches me had not realized it, and I was thinking that I really did not have to do it since my class was on Thursday and this was only Monday.

Then I dreamt that my sister had gone to the concert (which in reality had happened, but I had not gone) with me and that we met a lot of friends of ours and that after the concert we went to a coffee shop to drink some coffee.

I was in the bedroom with 2 boys of about 22 or 23 years who I now see often since we work together and we are friends. One of them starts to kiss me and fondle me, to which I strongly object, because besides my brothers are nearby (this boy courts me in real life), I think that I should not let this happen, but at the same time I don't make a strong enough stand to stop it. A little later I changed my clothes, and I remember distinctly that I put on a black pair of suede gloves, and I put my hands around his neck, telling him that I had put them on in order to strangle him. He starts kissing me again and fondling me all over, and I maintain a shy attitude. The dream might have produced a certain pleasure for me, but at the same time some shame and inhibition; but also a certain amount of calmness because in the dream itself I thought, ""It's not true; it's only a dream.""

The house in the dream was different from his real house. Suddenly my uncle appeared and he was rather drunk and beat up.

She lived in the building that was across the street from where I live now. She was not marrying her fiancé. In the dream she was already married, but she was marrying someone else and was giving a big party in that building. Her mother called me at work to tell me that she was very angry with her daughter for not having made the reception at their elegant residence. She thought that she could not take her fancy friends and relations to ""that building,"" and was ashamed to do it. In short, neither my aunt nor my uncle attended the party. I, on the contrary, fixed myself up very nicely to attend it. I put on make-up so I would look nice. I went, I talked to her, I ate, I danced, but I was very worried because my sister had asked me to take care of her two-year-old daughter while she went to the party, and I had left her all alone, playing with another little kid whom I cannot identify, so that I kept going across the street to my house to see how she was. I remember well that I couldn't go to the ceremony because I was working, and that in order to save time I had gone to work in the party dress, to go straight to the party from work. I had situated work in the block next to my cousin's place, and therefore very close to my own house. But I had put on my dress without putting on make-up, and that upset me so much that I wasn't calm until I found a chance to put make-up on. I saw my cousin, dressed in white, at the moment she came into her house, surrounded by people. I was asking her why she had married another man. Among the guests was her ex-husband who, naturally, was in his own home. I also remember that I was desperate when I was trying to amuse my sister's daughter, and I was missing the party, and she would run away from me, and I would have to chase her and bring her back by the hand."

The other one is a classmate at the university, about 20 years old, fat, and also very nice and smart. Another thing was that, though I have one brother and one sister, in the dream it looked as though I had two brothers.

But the bank in the dream was near the main market, and this is not true. Then in my dream it looked like the bank's vault led through a tunnel, known by everyone and lit, to the market. That is, the bank's vault led to a subterranean tunnel which in turn led to the lower part of the market, which is several stories high, and we were going through there and went to the stores. But my mother stayed in a store which was not the kind of store they have in the market building, but rather an ordinary store like you find in any corner of the city. And we stayed in front of that corner, but our corner did not look at all like the one in front, since the store in which we were is at the main square in Lima, and in the dream there was like part of the Lima portals on that corner. Anyway, we were working there. It seems that, in the dream, there was a fixed closing time, and if we didn't, they punished us and chased us, and the store where my mother was did not want to close. We had already closed when we heard sirens and other signs that they were coming to punish the people who did not obey the orders, then we (very scared) were going the other way because we had not seen my mother.

I was waiting for Susie's mother, who was going to bring us some shoes, rather old ones, that she was asking somebody to give to us, so that we could take them on the trip and not ruin our good shoes. Susie's mother, in the dream, was the complete opposite to what she really is. She was fat, tall, and dark, and Susie's mother is thin, like all Chinese, and therefore she couldn't be dark.

It seemed that the little dog he was pulling was suffering a great deal, and the ragamuffins were trying to unleash the dog in a way that the old man would not see, because he did not want them to let the dog go. Then I, who love dogs, went close to them and very carefully unleashed the dog without letting the old man realize it, since he could not see. At that instant the old man started to scream and to throw curses on us, and then he disappeared.

Many employees had already come down, but she hadn't. I got to a floor where the offices were modern (without exaggerations) and cozy. I looked at a girl (whom I don't know very well) who seemed to work there. I was like looking for something, and she did not see me when I went into another area. At that point Nelly and Martha appeared from some door, talking enthusiastically, and we went down together. The lobbies at the office had interesting magazines and pamphlets. One of them advertised a well-known resort, but the name was misspelled (from the point of view of phonetics). Nelly is usually not punctual in what she does and one can never have any confidence in her. That is why I didn't look for her with a lot of enthusiasm.

At the end of the day I felt the metal in the staple and its coolness and from rubbing it with my tongue, blood started to come out and I decided to take it off. I think I dreamt this because during the day I went to Chaclacayo with my family, looking for lodging.

Thinking about it a good while, before breakfast, I remembered that this had never happened, and that everything was in order. I must disclose the fact that I would have wanted something like this to happen, because the problem went as follows: A few days ago, my brother's fiancé came to my home while my cousin was visiting. I told my cousin that this was a person my mother knew, and she, due to something that was said, thought that she was my grandmother's godchild. Naturally I only told her this because my brother had recently been engaged and he expressly asked us not to tell the family about it, in order to avoid comments due to the young age of the bride-to-be. But my mother could not hide the fact any longer and when my uncle came to pick up my cousin, she told him that her son's fiancé had come, but she didn't say anything to my cousin, and she didn't find out. The worst of it is that this incident has left me very nervous, and I don't even want to go to my cousin's because then she will ask me why I didn't tell her, etc. It's been a week since my cousin's visit, but all the members of my family, including my parents and myself, are very nervous about the reaction of the other members of my family. I think that this has influenced my dream a lot. Coming back to the dream: I remember that my uncle was telling my cousin, ""You are a fool; you shouldn't have said anything,"" and my aunt, ""What they must have thought!"" My cousin was answering, ""But I didn't buy the magazines, they gave them to me; besides, what was I to do? They were not going to throw me out of the house for letting him know that they were keeping so many magazines and hadn't paid taxes for them.""

But the same pilot flew us back to Lima, Peru, and when we arrived, my father and my brothers were waiting for us at the airport, very worried. That's how my dream ended.

I must point out that my brother was already working in Apurimac, Abancay. It continues this way: Since I think that his work is dangerous, my brother was killed, I cried inconsolably due to the loss of my brother. So that Mother would not see, I went in the bathroom and cried there. They had already buried my brother, but in my dream I said that it wasn't true, that it couldn't be true, and so sleeping and dreaming, I was crying real tears. They were running down my cheeks, but I kept saying that it was a lie, that my brother hadn't died. Then I awoke and looked at his bed and saw it was empty, and then I thought that it was true and that he had died and I started to scream desperately. My father ran to see what was happening and asked me what was the matter and I told him that my brother, my dear brother, where was he, was he dead? And he told me, ""No, he isn't, my child, your brother is in Abancay, working; don't you remember?"" Only then did I realize that it had only been a dream, a horrible dream, and that I would never want this to happen and that is why I pray to God so that he will protect my brother and my boyfriend, because both of them have the same profession, and I think it's dangerous, at least my brother's, because he is not in Lima."

There were extremely poor houses around, and then a train was coming just when the car was on the tracks, but nothing happened. The girl with the car left us there, and the two of us had to go through some very ugly places, and even swim to cross a river.

In my dream I saw that the bank that is across the street from La Merced Church was across the street from school. There I saw a bunch of armed policemen, armed for assault, and they were observing us. Suddenly I saw a boy from my class who is one of the most rebellious agitators and he was going towards a group of boys who were on the same side of the street I was on, and I saw myself asking him what time the meeting would be. All of a sudden I was inside the school in a room next to the door, and suddenly everything was confusion. I heard screams from women who were frantically running. In the room we got to see that the police were invading the place. Suddenly we saw the policemen throwing tear gas bombs, even inside the room where we were. We couldn't go out, because it was worse outside, and we were getting desperate. Suddenly I saw my sister and I saw that the ones who were in the room shouted that we shouldn't go outside. I saw some people fainting. I felt faint myself, and when I came to, I found myself and 4 classmates (2 boys and 2 girls) lying on a table, and we tried to get out but we couldn't. We decided to shut the doors and windows, but through the door cracks they kept throwing tear gas at us. I felt desperate. I wanted to get out and look for another exit into the street. Then I started to think about my mother and father and to hear a friend telling me that it was because of this that she did not go to meetings. The boys were telling us that the police were unjust because we hadn't done anything; they were the ones who had suddenly and mysteriously invaded the place. The dream was interrupted here."

And then he told me that he was doing this because they were in a bad situation at home and he was trying to help his mother. I gave him everything of value I had and was very surprised because even though it was 9 p.m., there were many people in the store across the street from my house, and they all looked at the scene as though they understood and found it very natural. The boy, whose name is Victor, started to run. He was very nervous, and I remained petrified, and then I reacted and ran to my house and saw that it was not close, and I had to run about 8 blocks. I arrived at my house and saw that it was dark, that nobody was there and nobody opened the door for me. I felt desperate and I crossed the street and stood in front of my house, and suddenly I saw a car arriving to my house. It was a blue Dodge and it was big, but rather old (I think it was a 1960 model), and I wanted to stop the car, but then I went behind the car and first I saw my brother driving it, but when the car stopped and I got to it, I saw that an unknown man was driving it and my brother was sitting next to him. In the back of the car there were other people, and I was surprised to see they were people I knew from the university. I banged the car window so that they would open the door for me. I shouted that I had been assaulted and that there was nobody home, and I kept screaming to my brother that he should get out and open the door of the house, but he and his friends looked at me and smiled with sarcasm and making fun, and that's how the dream ended. Then I saw my mother scolding me for having left the university so early, before dawn, but I was telling her that the assault had happened at night, and she did not understand, and here everything stopped."

Across from the park I found a grocery and I asked the grocer for something which he did not have, and I started to play with his crayons and I had to buy the one I had broken. He gave me the money back with a coin which was very rare and old. Then I started to dream about rare coins. I and a girl, I think it was my cousin Bertha, and a boyfriend (I don't know who) started to look at them and classify them, although I told them I classified them in my head.

When I went in, I found another friend who was waiting for me to go see a ship, but we had to wait till the maid arrive because nobody was home and I had to leave word of where I was going. I don't remember exactly who the maid was, but everything looked familiar. It was my own house. But I don't know how, when we went out the door, there was a bunch of gentlemen of around 40 or 50 years who were waiting for us to get into the ship. My friend got in, but I couldn't because I said I felt uncomfortable with the clothes I had on and I asked them to wait for me to change. This time I went into a house that was on a second story, while mine is on the first, as though it were mine. I ran up the stairs and saw my mother and father who were asking me where I was going. I told them that I had been invited and that I had to change into slacks. I went into my room, and it was just as it is, except that for some reason I couldn't find the clothes that I was looking for, especially the shoes. I spent hours desperately trying to find them until I realized that my father had left some shoes he had bought for me on top of the dresser. There were many shoes, but in different sizes, all the same color and shape, and to my surprise, I realized that they were the ones I used in school. I put them on, but I realized that they did not have any straps to tie them, so I desperately searched everywhere until I found a pair of old shoes underneath my sister's bed and took the straps out and put them on mine. At that moment two girls about my age came up; one had black hair and the other brown, and they told me to hurry, that they had been waiting for me for quite a while. I don't know either of them. The brown-haired one stood at the bottom of the stairs and the black-haired one came up to the top of the stairs and stood there. My mother went over to talk to her and I felt very uncomfortable. I felt that the clothes I had on were bothersome and that they didn't match. I saw myself uncombed and in disarray. In contrast, the black-haired girl had a party dress on and my mother told me she was very pretty. Then we descended the stairs and I saw a ship at the door of my real house (not the one on the second story). It was a war ship and the heads of the gentlemen I had previously seen were sticking out from it. I don't know if I went inside or not because at that moment everything became blurry or I don't remember what happened."

The street was peculiar; it was filled with religious images, lit with candles. We walked, looking at these images, talking and laughing, until we reached or somehow got to her house, which wasn't really her house, but my grandfather's house. When we went in, her mother and nieces and nephews (between the ages of 1 and 12) were there.

I then told him that they were really nice, but he was angry. Then my friend asked me to prepare some food for her children, and I said no, that she should do it herself, but as usual I started to fix something. Then they served some soup for the rest of us and my friend's husband asked me what I thought of the meat I was eating, because he thought it was terrible. His wife disagreed because she thought it was good. Then he said that he was going to the movies to see ""Candy.""

Then I told her that this was because she had so badly wanted to gain weight and now she had to lose some.

In order not to be embarrassed, I told him we should go and we started walking toward his car, which was in a garage a block away from my house, but as we walked, we kept hearing my mother's screams, complaining. I was worried about what he would think and told him to excuse her because she was sick. He looked serious but was hugging me.

From there one could see a white cloud and an avalanche of very white snow was coming down. I almost started to run, but I thought it would be better to die with my whole family. We all huddled together and the snow came on top of us. It ended."

Finally we got through and went to a house that was big and quite dirty. A station wagon from the detective squad came and observed the house. My father hid some blueprints he'd been working on and another girlfriend appeared and I shoved her so that the detectives wouldn't see what my father had done. Suddenly a boyfriend whom I liked very much arrived, and I took him by the arm and we went for a walk. We sat on a wet stone and a Chilean girl criticized Peruvian girls and had an argument. I returned home with him and the dream ended."

There was an ordinary table and everything and 3 chairs. I only remember this, but not the walls or what surrounded this place. There was a woman, Marcia, of about 35 years and Ann, a girl of about 15, daughter of Marcia. Marcia was the cook of the next door neighbors we had when I lived in Arequipa. In the dream she was complaining to me about Ann. I am not sure about this, but so it seems to me."

My cousin suggested that we each go different ways (I had thought we were going to go together), but I got scared. It was 10 o'clock at night.

Now I'll describe the dream: I was in Arequipa, but it was in a house where I lived before I came here. That is, it wasn't the one I lived in when I came here; am I making myself understood? Well, it was about two hours before the car came to pick us up and I asked my mother when we were going to fix the stuff that we had left, and she was telling me to start and so on. There were lots of things and several suitcases and from that bunch of stuff we picked out what we thought was best. Well, when there weren't any more suitcases, I handed my mother a large bag for her to put what remained in there. But before that, the driver came to pick us up, and we told him to come back later, and I had a terrible feeling, knowing that we had run out of time. Well, before everything else, I now remember that I had gone to confession and when I went into the church, there were two confessionals, one on each side. Then I went to the one on the left, but there was a very old priest, all bent down and with a hunchback, so I went to the other one because he was younger."

"F45-2"	"None"	"#F45-2 In this one I was in a rather large, unfamiliar place that looked somewhat like the portals at San Martin Square (Lima). Instead of sidewalks and roads, it was some sort of a yard that was next to a wall (something like a seawalk), but this place was not by the sea. I was with a bunch of guys, around my age, and I started to think that I was the only woman in the place, and at that moment a bus that picked up people who worked in a nightclub passed by. This called our attention and we were asking each other questions. In spite of being surrounded by so many people, I felt lonely. At this point I turned around and saw a group of three girls, among whom there was a friend who went to school with me (she sat next to me in school and we formed a quartet which we called ARAB from the initials of the four names; it's the best way to describe her). When we started to talk, I remembered that she had relatives in Chimbote and I asked her if her family was alright, if nothing had happened to them in the May 31st earthquake which affected that zone. She told me that two of her brothers had died. Then she laughed and said it was a lie, and I was so relieved! I also asked her about her brother (older than she) whom we used to tease when she wrote letters to him in school. She told me he was alright and that he always remembered the quartet that teased him. I don't know how I got away from them and I became like a child in my behavior. I wanted to play, jump, laugh, because I felt lonely and bored. I could see the group of boys doing their thing on one side and the girls on the other. Then they started to come toward me one by one because they were also bored. I had tried to call their attention. We started to look at the stores and then we saw a group of foreign sailors and we thought we would introduce ourselves to them and did so. They were either North American or English (one of these, and it seems they were North American). They only spoke English; none of them knew Spanish. One of the girls who knew English started to translate what they and we were saying. Since I didn't understand anything in English, because I always studied French, I felt kind of strange and kept getting more bored. The girl who knew English had graduated from a British school which is near my home and her parents are North American. I know several girls from that school and know that they come out speaking English perfectly, but I don't remember this girl. Truthfully, she wasn't one of the ones I know. That was all of my dream, because I awoke at that moment."
"F45-3"	"None"	"#F45-3 The dream I'm about to tell happened in several surroundings. I can't say they were more than one dream because I remember it as one. In the first place I was at home, but the structure of the building was different. My mother was with me and she was sewing a robe. When we looked out the window to see the street, we saw Fanny, a friend of mine, in front of the house (19 years old). I was telling my mother, ""Look how much weight she's lost."" I was about to call her when she told me not to because she was playing volleyball with some friends. I could really hear the ball bouncing. When we looked out the window later, we saw she was inside the car in which we had seen her before, lying there with her friends and in the back of the car. There were some North American girls that had come to Peru on a cultural exchange. Fanny talked to my mother and told her that her mother had also made herself a silk robe. She asked my mother about that material she was using to make the robe and its quality, and told her about some material that I don't remember which I have never known about. Then the North American girl asked me about the number 7 bus line, which took you to another one (10 or 14). Since I didn't know, I told her so. Then I remembered several bus lines -- 10B, 70, 14 -- which go by my house. While I was thinking of them, I was already walking with my friend Mary (19 years) through a row of hills. We wanted to come down from there and we walked horizontally until we reached a road that was almost vertical, which led to another which was in between two hills. We came down, almost running, and then I remembered that one day in Punta Hermosa (a southern beach) I had done the same thing and had gathered so much momentum that when I reached the road, which was narrow, I had to keep climbing the next hill until I could stop, so I wouldn't fall (this really happened to me and I remembered it in my dream). We continued on the path, which was rather broad, and we were saying that we had to go back because our parents were waiting for us. But after walking a while, we saw a couple of North American sailors, with two girls from the same country, behind us. Mary told me we should go over to them and we did this, and we decided to go to the beach. Following the path, we arrived at a sandy place and couldn't see the sea, but when we walked three steps from there, we saw it. I was asking myself why we hadn't seen it before. I thought that perhaps because I was short, but this was not it. I saw my brother swimming and he called me to the beach, but later I didn't see him any more. Then Mary and I took off our slacks and our blouses and we already had bathing suits on. When I started to swim, it seemed to me that the sea was rough and pulling me and I wanted to get out, but couldn't. Then a big wave came, bringing lots of jelly fish, and I was scared of them (I am) and I came out in a hurry. When I got out, I saw my mother, father and brothers coming and I went toward them, getting away from the group of Mary and the sailors because of what m parents might think. I could hear what they were saying, because they were speaking Spanish. Then my mother started to put some cream on my head, telling me that it was so that the sea water would not spoil my hair. but I didn't want to go in because there were jelly fish. (Fanny and Mary are friends of mind and I like them very much and appreciate them.)"
"F45-4"	"None"	"#F45-4 I am sure that my dream happened at the university, but the building was completely different. I had been in class and then one of the professor called my 10-year-old sister and asked her to recite the lesson and she did it very well (this amazed me because when she recites her own lessons, she gets stuck with words). Everybody applauded her. Among the students and sitting in the third row was my mother. Becky, my sister, addressed her and told her that she had studied for her, and I got upset and told her to sit down. In my dream there were two boys I like, I am attracted to them. It was strange to see them in the classroom because they really study in different classes. Seeing the attitude I had taken towards my sister, A. was looking surprised at me. He was just behind me, but I didn't care at all. The other one, B., was sitting in the same row as my mother, but his hair was lighter. When I turned to look at my mother, she was no longer there. I remember having seen her later on and asked her if she had seen B. and told her that he looked better every day. To this she replied that he seemed to have changed (in real life, my mother doesn't know him, has never seen him and has just heard me talk about him). Later on, since the class was over, I went out in the hallway and found Fanny (female, 19) who asked me to go to the department offices with her, and while we were there, I saw to my surprise that the Dean of the school was Sister Angela (she is a nun who was, and still is, the principal of my high school). When we asked for the results of our tests, the lights went out (according to the nun, all over the school), but when I returned to my class, they were not out and the others weren't either. The boys were getting ready to pull a practical joke and had drawn the caricature of a man on the board. When I went it, I sat at another place where another friend of mine from school (who didn't get into the university) was sitting with her younger sister. The boys who were in back of us started playing with our caps. They took them off and put them back on. Anyway, they messed my hair. Some boys who were in front were laughing. I got angry. Angie had to comb my hair (in real life, I have never played with the boys). Then Sister Angela arrived and made us get out of the room because, according to her, the lights had gone out, even though these were on. She led us through a corridor to a door and, opening it, she made us go into a church. I knew its name. I said it is such and such, but I didn't know it. They made us go in and sit on benches and a priest who was saying Mass interrupted it in order to teach us Theology. I was sitting on the first bench and was amazed. A moment later he interrupted the class and continued with the Pater Noster of the Mass, but in order to say it, he gave a plate of food which we had to exchange with each other and nobody should have the same plate that they had at the beginning. Only one girl cheated (if you can call it that) and kept the same dish. Well, this happened only with a few of us (among them myself) because the rest of the girls had disappeared. The priest made us sit at the table where the religious act was being done. That's all; we were sort of playing at the altar. I had forgotten a detail -- at the university we were all in our old school uniform (the one used in 4th grade). I don't remember whether the boys were wearing uniforms."

There were more people there than in reality and more men (in my class there is only one). I didn't want to go out and take the test by any means and kept waiting to the last moment. A boy who is the brother of a friend of mine (both are in the university, but I never speak to him) came into the class. I remember he came in and sat the wrong way, in order to talk to a girl; he seemed to me to be very uneducated and uncouth. Then he went out of the class just as freshly as he had come in. I remember there were only three people left to take the exam: a boy, Silvia (a friend of mine who studies English instead of French at the same Academy or school of languages, and studies with me at the university) and I. Silvia and I looked at each other and got away, leaving the boy to take the test before us. Then I remember having gone to the yard or garden and putting on the swimsuit there to take the test. My cousin Dotty (20 years) who had not been in the dream at any other point was next to me, also in a swimsuit. Then I came out to take the exam and everybody was teasing me because I had a bathing suit on and I told them that I had it on because I knew they were going to get me wet and didn't want my clothes to be spoiled.

The man I had imitated was following us everywhere and that made us laugh, it was like openly flirting with him. The man was approximately 28 or 30 years old. Then we got to a street where there was a small neighborhood bookstore, which in my dream was the administration office at the university. The exams of the History of Culture were there, tied as though they were a bundle of newspapers. I seized the occasion to ask for mine. I had to search through the bundle to find mine, and in order to do that I had to pull out the ones on top and place them on the side. When I found mine, the other exams had been already given out, according to me, because there were only a few left. When I saw my grade, I didn't laugh anymore because I had flunked, I had gotten 40. Then I told my mother, ""They flunked me, I could never raise that grade. This happens to me because of having laughed so much."" In real life, I have always had the notion that when I laugh a lot, I will then cry; something will happen to make me cry.  I always think about this when I laugh too much. Now, about dreaming of flunking, this always happens. Whenever they are going to hand me a grade, I dream about that test, I see a grading notebook or some such document, and I always dream that I flunk. Then, when I see my grade it's a passing one. In this instance, this has happened too. I've come out alright, I've passed the test."

I went in and everybody was there. They are eight children, but nobody paid attention to me. I started to talk to someone and at that point I got up. I passed by Chiqui and I remembered, I went to where she was sitting and on my knees and hugging her from the back. I sang Happy Birthday in her ear. I wanted everything to go well.

I would tell her that this wasn't the one. So it happened about three times until I took it and we went inside to wrap it. There were shelves filled with toys and a girl who was looking at us. She told me it cost about $10, and I told her that I didn't have that much, only about $5. Then I told her that I would leave the small radio I had as a deposit. And when she had it, I told her that I was only leaving it because it was an expensive radio; it was foreign. She took it and liked it and then I realized that it was too much, that I should only leave the money. She didn't want this. She told me it was the radio or nothing. I took the radio from her and at that point a friend called Mary came to tell me that another friend had come to pick me up in a car because I was supposed to study with her. I went out running and got in the car, and the first friend was left alone. I didn't know what to do. The car had already started.

When I saw him, there was an old lady behind him who looked like a witch. It seems there was some relation between them. I told him to run faster and I was afraid of the old woman, so both of us ran. But before, when It old him to run faster, he answered something to the effect that she moved very slowly, but we moved fast, so we shouldn't worry. We kept on running until we got to a corner. It was a corner I knew because it was and is part of the neighborhood where I used to live, which I don't like. Well, when we got there, I crossed over to the other street, but very briefly saw a face that smiled in the strangest way; I think it was a homosexual. I didn't see the kid any more. I think I kept on running. I had never seen the old woman or the kid or the homosexual. I am not sure, but I think that in this dream I saw a small cat, with a light fur, but I can't say at what point I saw it."
"F48-2"	"None"	"#F48-2 I was in a church where Mass was being said. I was in one of the front rows; it was about noon. Suddenly, when I turned around, I saw a priest friend of mine. He was with another lady, not very young, and with a stern expression. He made a gesture like asking me what had happened, what I had done till now. I felt ashamed, but didn't let it show. I just looked at him and turned around. The priest who was saying Mass stopped it and said that the next part would continue later on and he invited us to go somewhere, I don't remember where, but suddenly I was in a house where they had a birthday party for a relative of my priest friend. I saw myself surrounded by girlfriends, and we were making jokes. I saw a friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. She is tall and thin, has green eyes and long hair. We were talking, and I think we ate something, I don't remember what it was. Note: The priest friend of mine is 28 years old, he is a professor, but he never taught me. He gave me the chance to transfer to the university where he teaches, and I got in, but later on I got out and never discussed this with him, because I didn't see him. The friend I describe was one of the best friends I had in school."
"F48-3"	"None"	"#F48-3 I was in the house where I used to live before this one, all of us were there, including my father. It was around 10 a.m., somewhat late, because it seems that we had had a late night and we were all in pajamas. We were very happy. It was my brother's birthday (he is three years older than I, 24). My stepbrother, on my father's side, was there (he is married and has a family). I saw he had blue pajamas on, but the top was too short for him. It was a Saturday and when we were having breakfast, they knocked on the door and nobody wanted to open it. We all told my brother whose birthday it was to open, but he didn't want to because he was not well dressed. Since it was Saturday, my brother and I wanted to go out, but it seems that my father said that only one of us could go out and the other should stay. I felt I was going to win and that my father was letting me decide and I felt a strange sensation. I don't know how to explain it; it was like a disappointment or anger, I don't know. I wasn't happy."
"F48-4"	"None"	"#F48-4 I was walking by a big road, at the edge; I was with my mother. Then we met my cousin and his friend (M). We talked of something, I don't remember, and then left them. Then I was on a bus and they were in the back and I saw my little nephew sleeping and we had packages with us. We got off and didn't say goodbye to them. I got home and my mother was sick in bed, the room was in disorder and my aunt, my mother's sister-in-law, had been there. I was angry because my little nephew was sleeping on my bed and I told my mother that she was always bringing them over and then leaving them to me. I started to fix the room and I went to the closet and opened it, and I saw a black coat inside. I think I was going to take something out of there."
"F48-5"	"None"	"#F48-5 I was with my mother in a taxi and we were going to a movie. We met a blonde and rather fat girl and since she was in a hurry, she started to drive herself. She knew the route very well, and the driver liked the idea and gave her his seat. We got to the movies. Next to it was a store. In it they sold stuff for hair care. I asked for a couple of things and put one of them in the bag I was carrying, without meaning to keep it, but the salesgirl didn't see it that way, I think. We went into the movie theater, which was very nice, and we sat in the front rows. In the movie I saw an actor I like very much and I don't remember any more."
"F48-6"	"None"	"#F48-6 I was at a party; a wedding was going on. I was wearing a pantsuit and when I was dancing with a fellow who was sort of a Casanova type, my pants fell down. I turned around and went towards the back and found my mother and she fixed it up."
"F48-8"	"None"	"#F48-8 I was in a room and I saw two of my classmates suddenly and we started to talk about clothes. I saw I was putting on a pair of light brown men's slacks (striped with red). I tried it on and found that it was too big, and I immediately thought I would fix it up and wear it. I also thought that fashion these days is very similar for both sexes."
