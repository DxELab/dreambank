    "description": "The dream reports in this collection come for one of the earliest and most extensive studies of dream content ever conducted in the sleep laboratory.  They are the only set of dreams in the DreamBank that includes dream reports collected in a sleep lab.  In addition, the set also includes dreams written down at home from the same young adult males who were studied in the lab.  The study was carried out in 1963-1964 at the University of Miami by Calvin S. Hall and Robert Van de Castle with a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The main results can be found in a paper by Domhoff and Schneider in the Dream Library on dreamresearch.net.  Their findings show that home and lab dreams differ mainly in terms of the greater amount of physical aggression in home dreams.  This means that dreams written down at home, if done so fully and carefully, can be useful in dream research."
