    "description": "Phil is a retired humanities professor with no professional or theoretical interest in dreams. He has provided us with dreams from three periods of his life, stretching from age 15 to age 62. We have no other dream series that covers such a long time span starting from such a young age. The dreams have never been studied. No biographical information is available on Phil, and he is not available to provide answers to questions, but it is still a great series.  (For further information about Phil and his dream series, click here.)"
