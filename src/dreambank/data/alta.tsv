"1"	"(1957)"	"The one at the Meads's house, where it's bigger inside than out; there's a European village just inside, with a cobblestone street and a Pied-Piper sort of man with curly hair, he can do things like juggle - I go up the back stairs [there aren't any in the real house] and then down the other side [since there's a second set, immediately] then down a short empty hallway that turns a corner, where I find a tiny room...a young woman with shoulder-length blonde hair in a pageboy is there, cooking at a stove that almost fills the room...she's nice to me. Now outside, I'm waiting for my aunt to pick me up - she arrives in a little round convertible and we go for a drive, not very far - we cross a little bridge over a creek, then double back and she drops me off at the house again. Inside (?) I sit with a couple of people, playing with a string of blue balloons."
"2"	"(8/11/67)"	"I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me."
"3"	"(8/1/85)"	"I watch a plane fly past and shortly realize it was too low. It crashes not half a block away (rather as though it fell from a height of a few yards than flying straight into the ground). and I think there might be survivors, and that I should call the police. Before I get the number dialed, I realize I want the fire department instead. I get no ring, try again and find the line is dead. Some people (3? - at least one a woman) are coming toward the house and I understand they are responsible for the dead phone and I should be suspicious of them. I try to leave the house - run into a pregnant girl at the back; she seems to be in some sort of a bad way and has maybe started labor. The woman from the plane comes this way, calls the others to come get the pregnant girl, and I pretend to be asleep or dead. They don't buy it, I guess, and we all go inside. I'm not a prisoner, I don't think, so much as being detained for some reason, and I go to my brother's old room. He moved out of it a couple of years ago but there is furniture still there and I haven't looked around in a long time. [This does not seem to be the family home - I felt like it was rented.] There are a couple of chests of drawers that I realize I could have used downstairs long ago, yet I've been looking for acceptable furniture all this time. Also there are blankets (as well as clothes and shoes - women's shoes - but they aren't important), a lot of blankets, and I badly needed those last winter but didn't realize they were here. Also a very nice shoe rack. The woman comes back to say or do something. [I don't know what, and the dream ended about there, I think.]"
"4"	"(1985?)"	"Me pulling the green leaves and berries off some branches or a bush (not from a live one growing in the ground, but inside the house). A boy of 10 or 12 is impatiently telling me, ""Mother's asleep"" (I think) - as if I'm not supposed to be doing what I'm doing instead of her or without her knowledge or something. This is in an old rambling house with lots of old furniture and interconnected rooms. Lace doilies on little tables, throw rugs, etc. Some of ""us"" (family? friends?) - there's 3 or 4 of us, I think - are outside and there's a dog on the rampage - didn't we think it was a wolf at first? Anyway it turns out to be a black boxer or bulldog or something and it charges the back door. There's some kind of flap or opening in it that I plug up - I don't know what the people outside are doing but they're okay and they come in shortly. Somebody has rather by accident invited somebody like a neighbor to come over for something on the order of borrowing a cup of sugar. Trouble is this person always has a party with him/her. Kind of a group of hangers-on who just hang around talking and drinking tea and you can't ever get them to go away. For some reason I go to the front door. There are 2 of them in the room at the front, in a couple of chairs each with doilies, and little tables next to them with doilies and little lamps, and I think they're men in fairly formal suits and oblivious to anything around them. I sort of look at them in resignation or bemusement. There's a staircase here. (They don't go upstairs, after all they are just visitors, not a mob.) Outside there is a hutch as for rabbits or something, covered, not particularly nice. Next to it are a couple of little open shelters with no amenities. There is a guinea pig in each place. The sun is shining directly on the two outside and it's hot. The one inside is not particularly comfortable but he's okay. The other two are dehydrating and too weak to move. I come and look at them, feeling sad and sympathetic but no anger - I have the idea the person who set this up isn't there. I'm going to take them in and try to save them but I'm not sure I can. I'm not going to just let them die out here. The reason they're here if because they were replaced by the one inside like their usefulness as displays was used up. I want to come back and take away the other one, and get him out of the nasty cage. I'm sad."
"5"	"(1985?)"	"I'm in a room that reminds me of (but definitely isn't) the living room of the house on A Street. I am there because I live there or at least it belongs to me and I spend time there, and I am on vacation or something. It's afternoon and I remember how the light looked and my cousin came to see me for a visit, as though to let me in on some news or just for fun. I don't know of anything else that happened, but it did involve him lying around on the floor very much the way I do. Very comfortable and casual and warm - that is, that's the way I was feeling. So there's a Training going on, and the room reminds me a bit of school, like a school auditorium. The light is greenish, daylight, morning. The staff wasn't sitting behind tables but in rows of chairs. It was still early - we were instructed to go up on the stage, and we did, but they weren't quite organized and we were standing there for a while. Very informal and chummy. Later I left for a break and went (home?) somewhere away, not a restaurant, for more time than a dinner break. Pete Townsend was with me and maybe some other people. (He wasn't on the team.) Don't know what was going on there, but when it was time to go back we had an errand to run - stopped at a sort of store on a sort of small-town main street. We were going inside and this guy who was with us burst out at me - I don't know what about - and said he was arresting me and getting a peace bond on me. I was shocked but didn't know what it was about except that he was angry at the effect I was having on the group of people that P.T. was involved with. In any case, he keeps me with him and we may have gone inside and come back out again. The place reminds me rather of a dry-goods store, with rows of waist-high bins, and a counter along the side. On the way out, P.T. takes the guy aside and says something very stern and final-sounding in French. I knew it was French but I don't understand it and that was the reason he was using it, so that I wouldn't be embarrassed or have to hear something I wouldn't want to. The guy said something back in French but shorter. P.T. just looked at him like he was disgusted and all through, and took me outside. We got in the car and were driving back - I was still kind of stunned and found he was talking to me - he was explaining something about the incident, and that he could do without this other guy, who I think had been his friend; but he couldn't do without me. He looked at me and said very firmly, ""I need you"". I was overwhelmed and leaned over to him and he pulled me over for a hug. At some point I was concerned that we weren't going to get back to the Training in time because of stopping for an errand, and I thought there might turn out to be another and another, the way I do it."
"6"	"(1985?)"	"Living next door to Loretta in an apartment - looks as if we just moved in or were just moving out. I'm in her place, and aware that the door is open to my place and anyone could walk in and steal things. (It's also as though there's no front wall at all - and this is upstairs, not inside the building but facing outside, we're at the end of the walkway and the stairs are at the other end so anyone coming would pass my place first). Don't know what's happening, but there's a group of people involved. At least 3 of us stop at a grocery store on our way somewhere - an outing of some sort, like a picnic or an amusement park. The 3rd person is a woman I don't recognize, but she's friendly and energetic - I think she has a kid - this is her store and she knows what we're looking for. It's the sort of place you don't see much anymore - leftover from the Fifties and Sixties. Funny lighting. Also a brief image of going high on an overpass in an open car - don't know who's driving - blue skies, sunlight - there's something beside the overpass that we mean to grab at but it's not easy to reach and we think it's best not to try."
"7"	"(1985?)"	"Kidnapped - I'm on my way somewhere else (by car?) and stop to visit with some people I know - seems like a few houses or buildings together, maybe like a small village out in the country somewhere. Some people with guns turn up, rather like political terrorists, and they're going to keep us prisoner until something, but I don't know what. I grouse about it and use the word ""kidnapped"" and they think it rather an affront that I would use the word - hurt their feelings. I'm rather in two minds about trying to escape - I think it's the right thing to do but I'm not sure because I find I don't trust these people not to shoot me (!) or the others not to botch the job. In the end, one of them gives me an opportunity - I kind of think voluntarily - and I run. Somebody chases me, but I keep on running - stop once and look around, decide to keep running just in case. They give up fairly soon. Later I go back, after they've been caught - I don't know if that was my doing or not - and there was some problem with punishing them. I'm real mad because I don't think they're being dealt with harshly enough. My friends try to talk to me, make me see that they aren't such bad guys as I made them out to be, and I won't listen. (And they aren't - they didn't hurt anybody, or get nasty. My biggest problem was being so angry at the insult to my freedom, that anyone would think he or she had any right to interfere with it for any reason.)"
"8"	"(1985?)"	"I'm alone in an apartment - old place, inside the building - it's dark, maybe I've gone to bed - somebody breaks in, there's at least 2 of them and they come towards my room, being quiet, they don't know I'm here. I can't lock the door (or maybe it makes too much noise) but I try to hold the door shut so they'll think it is. Doesn't work. A guy with a knife comes in - black, looks the part of a bad guy, leather jacket, nasty expression. Waves the knife. I say, ""you don't need that knife"" and he says something like, ""Oh, so I don't need the knife, huh?"" - sneering-like, and feints it at my face. I am very aware there's nothing I can do to help myself and I'm afraid but stand still. He pushes the knife at me again and I grab his wrist and he sort of turns the knife upward to cut my wrist with it - I'm aware that even if I can kick him I'm probably going to die or get hurt."
"9"	"(1985?)"	"I'm somewhere with a friend I don't want to be around much and going back to her house and then elsewhere on errands. She asks me to take something with me to return to the library. At her house I see her mother and stepfather. (Rather young and both attractive.) They're both in a hurry to get somewhere too, rushing about. I seem to want to stay, or I want something from them, and am reluctant to go out the door - but I do, and stick my head back in several times with one last question. Then I remember the library - the things to take back are very large magazines (""American Baby""?) And even have ""return to Marty"" written on the front - Marty is the mother - so I say to her, ""don't you work right by the library?"" and she says yes, she'll take them for me, so that was nice. I can almost remember where she worked, someplace like an aerospace or computer office, standard modern waiting room, light colors, plants, etc."
"10"	"(1985?)"	"I am in some public place, reminds me of the grocery store in another dream, or lots of airports - there is food involved, and for some reason or other people are eating in the restroom. (This isn't normal.) I'm sitting at the mirror-counter next to a man, and am very ill at ease about it. There's no actual reason for it, it's entirely the principle of the thing."
"11"	"(1985?)"	"At a school - I don't think I actually go to it but I'm with somebody else; it's real close to the end of the year and everybody has a what-the-hell attitude. We're in a big open room without chairs to see a film (educational, of course) and my friend parks beside a big obnoxious-looking woman (also not a standard-issue school student) but I don't relish the idea so I pick another spot and my friend joins me. The film rolls and it involves sport or dancing, and a couple of kids get up to demonstrate something which involves vigorous movement, and they ""dance"" right outside to the open grass and air - a spot rather like one at Scarb Faire. I seem to have come along for the ride, as has somebody from the class who's supposed to be getting them back in the classroom and doesn't really care any more than they do. The routine is something like, ""well I looked but I didn't find them"" and everybody goes their merry way."
"12"	"(1985?)"	"Me and MB (one of my cats) in a big fancy dark-colored van - going to some kind of a show. She was in a cage to go there but came out for it - don't know what happened at (like an auditorium?) but we came back to the van. I put her in the driver's side door and went around to the other. Then I fiddled with the door a long time. It was a double swing door, and I hadn't known about this one inside latch about 2/3 up the door - black switch - that latched the side without a handle by itself. I tried several different things to see what it did, then when I got the whole thing shut up it was real dark inside and everything was real awkward. MB went back in her cage and we started off, but I was having some trouble handling the van. We were going along a dirt road on the grounds of the auditorium, joining a line of cars to get to some place like a campground for another event. We weren't gonna stay but I wanted to do something there. We were behind a guy with dark hair and a blonde older woman in a convertible and the guy first looks startled, then nervous, then annoyed at the van. Keeps looking around at us and I wondered what I was doing wrong. I figured I was driving the van backwards at first and looked out for a place I could turn around, but then I realized I wasn't backward, but I was on the passenger side driving with an auxiliary steering wheel. Would've been difficult to change but I figured I was managing all right anyway, so I went on. When we were entering the campground, something happened to the guy in front of us. He's now in a hole in the middle of the road, like up to his shoulders, and he's bitching at a rabbit, who's come up to look at him. He has to duck down for cars to go over the road, rabbit runs off, we go to a place where the road circles around at its end and people have parked. Bit of a hill it's on. Concrete or stone toilet-building like they have in parks. I swing the van around this tight little circle looking for an empty space and there really isn't one, but the swinging around is something of a challenge and apparently it made an impression because some people clapped. I did stop the van in a place that I figured I couldn't leave it but I just wanted to ask somebody the price of cattle. Somebody told me $31 a head and I wanted to explain that I meant a sort of middle-range rather than the best, or real cheap."
"13"	"(1985?)"	"I arrive at a little frame house on a nice little residential street, in a car in the company of a couple of older women. It's been raining and might rain again. It's dark but not necessarily night. We go into the house, which belongs to another nice little old lady. We have an errand there and ought to get back somewhere pretty soon. Seems to me we're all a trifle edgy about something, but not all of us know what about. Like the lady of the house here - she knows something's not right, but isn't asking for explanation."
"14"	"(1985?)"	"I'm in my own apartment by myself and have to go outside for something - it's in an apartment complex more typical of the old place on N Street - regular white box. It's dark and gray and rainy outside, and I'm not anxious to get wet, but I have to do this - maybe while it's not raining hard but only dripping I can get out and back again. There isn't anybody around and I'm kind of apprehensive about it - the place is not exactly cheerful and gay on a good day, but now it's almost sinister. I'm blocked by the gutter runoffs to get into my apartment, and I don't much fancy trying to go round the long way. I wait for it to slack off so I can duck it, but I get pretty wet anyway. The door of my apartment is standing open (I didn't go far), and somehow I've got an idea there's somebody in here. I haven't seen a soul around and I wasn't out of sight of the door for very long but I've got this feeling anyway. I pause at the door and stick my head inside, looking around. (There really isn't any furniture in here to speak of - it looks a lot like I've just moved in, or maybe I'm getting ready to move out but I don't think so.) I think I call out - suppose it would be ""Is anybody here?"" And there's silence for a bit, then my cousin comes out of the hallway. (He looks healthier than usual - an enhanced my cousin, clearer, rounder, more cheerful and easy.) He's come to visit and I was expecting him but didn't know when - he's glad to see me and I'm relieved but still a bit paranoid."
"15"	"(1/11/86)"	"I'm in a car with some people coming from a downtown area to a place past lots of trees and some development. We pass a (power?) pole that has things coming off it that look like weird limbs and I'm surprised, and explain it to the others, who think that's a little strange but amusing. We're some sort of family group but I don't know who they are now."
"16"	"(1/11/86)"	"I'm in a little store with another woman and maybe a kid - looks like an antique store but has other things, including odd-looking Christmas ornaments. I'm admiring some of them - also the others find some bubble-pack things, toys that are from a film whose name they can't place, but I'm familiar with it - takes me a minute to get it right and then there's another related set nearby that's from another movie I recall right away - they're both like children's science-fiction, and English, which is why I know them and the others don't. There is some element of this all being a bit strange."
"17"	"(1/12/86)"	"I am with a lot of LT people, at something like a talk - a church service - don't know. Ben is there and he kisses me the way he usually does and asks me to go out with him - not just for one date, for fun, but sort of like a trial going steady. I say it may be okay, but I want to think about it and talk to Sue S.. I don't actually do that, but I do see Sue sometime else in the dream, she's sitting in the ""audience"" sort of place and there's a very loose sort of atmosphere where we are, as though it were an ongoing class and you can divert your attention from it to talk to people - very much as the Training is, but not physically set up that way and we're not actually doing anything but looking on."
"18"	"(1/14/86)"	"Another old house - Melanie coming over - lip-synching in front of mirror to something big and bluesy - somebody came in right after, says she does the same thing - big open place like a studio - in a living room with Barbara and somebody else, visiting - talked about something like my trip somewhere, was it Renaissance Faire or SCA? Or plan for going there? Pipes on couch - had to move them to sit the way I want - plain poles like the chairset poles."
"19"	"(1/14/86)"	"Or deliver me to house? We sit in car, M. looks up at very strange dragonfly - looks like a weird plane till I see it's quite close and lands on a tree. Baby one with it. Bunch of other animals come out in front yard - somebody else comes out with - one cat comes up to car the way a dog would, stands up to window and acts like it'll jump in - I rub its head and say hello - it's an old friend (my cat?) - big gray, round sturdy head. I ask my cousin about paying him this weekend. ""What I figure is $60 every other week, ok?"" - afraid he's going to say otherwise. Doesn't answer before dream ends."
"20"	"(1/14/86)"	"Eating in a back hallway - Jimmy comes along and orders big meal - when it comes on huge tray, waiter knocks off something of mine and one of J's plates slides off. As I pick mine up it sticks in cheese and nearly pulls J's steak onto floor - it barely goes on again. Get everything right and J's asking if he can get new steak - several little tables involved with drop leaves and no shelves."
"21"	"(1/18/86)"	"I'm on a footbridge with some friends and there's a baby bear that I want a closer look at because he really doesn't look like a bear. I fall off the bridge but I hold onto a rope and a fence that's a short distance from the bridge for some reason. I can swing back to the bridge but need help to get back up and I yell for my friends and they don't stop right away."
"22"	"(1/19/86)"	"At work (?) was on the elevator with an older woman who wasn't sure what floor she wanted so she pushed extra buttons - I'd already gone up when I meant to go down to 2, and wasn't thrilled at having to stop so much. So I got off (she was surprised I took exception) and found myself outside, sort of, and now I have to get in a car that goes somewhere down some streets like in Oak town - the car was like an old '50s sort of thing with fins and they were coming off and needed to be stuck back down, took a while - arrived at a place that was an ""elevator stop"", nice old tree-lined street, the door didn't face the street - it was ivy-covered stone, very nice. Inside it was cave-like and open, but there was the elevator door. There was somebody there as well as 2 cats, and I made some comment about them having kittens (like it would be a good idea) and the guy said they were both males or something and I felt the same sort of cuteness about the exchange you usually do talking about kitties. I think I got on the elevator, and when I got to the next place I was talking to Margaret Laurence, who was enthusiastic about my intentions to do something or other, and the conversation was interrupted by Pam , who came to say the same sort of thing - they talked together for a minute before I stopped them, then they took turns."
"23"	"(1/20/86)"	"Visiting some rich people - there's a fire in their oil field, very near the house - people trying not to panic - hadn't caused any building damage yet and we're trying to salvage things from the house, china in cabinets and so forth. I'm aware of a difference between us, that my visit is okay and they're glad I'm helping, but after the emergency I'm not necessarily going to be a permanent fixture."
"24"	"(1/21/86)"	"Bonnie came to see if I needed anything and just poked around before going to work - later I went to Bluebonnet and was looking at things like a perfume (""White Oak""?) that I couldn't smell and other such things when I realized I just came straight on without a shower or anything and I must look awful. I went round to the back and got out my little mirror - decided I'd manage. While I was deciding, I'd got on a bus in the parking lot, and was halfway down the drive before I realized I'd better get off, my car was here at the store. Somewhere I run into Dad and My stepmother, who I carried on a casual conversation with and we went on to walk home together. (I wasn't living with them, but it was on the way.) There wasn't much conversation, and My stepmother walked on ahead. I fell into a daydream about a quiz show kind of like the one I'd seen yesterday, ""Chance of a Lifetime"" - only it was more like something I'd seen in England and it was the sort where you had to decide if you were coming back the next day to win more. I daydreamed it was me playing and planning to go for it all when I came awake and saw that My stepmother was nowhere in sight. Dad wasn't concerned, he said she'd probably gone by to see about ""the boys"" - who I took to mean my brother and male cousin, living together as roommates. We cut through somebody's yard and across the corner of a yard and a porch. I knew we were in Oak town and recognized the kind of little semi-shabby house, but kind of envied it and the little apartment house we passed - one window had something hanging in it that I noticed. Wherever the place was, they weren't home, and we went on (I was aware of it being a very long walk) past where Grandmom used to live [which is not in Oak town] . We stopped - for a rest? - next to the house, just where you couldn't see it, facing the railroad track. Dad leaned against (a car?) and talked a little, as if to himself, about how he wished things were different - with him and My stepmother, with the family - and he looked sad and dejected. I started to tell him he could have it different, maybe for both of them, maybe just for him, and almost got to tell him about LT when I woke up - I'd said I was going to a psychotherapist and that was good, but what really made the difference was..."
"25"	"(1/22/86)"	"I'm going down a walkway between little, close-set houses looking for something and pretending I'm in a detective story, sneaking around and prepared for anything - I jump at a sound and dive into a convenient garage, flipping over and springing into position behind something for cover. Ironically, the door starts to close - slides sideways. The person doing it peeks in for a second. I recognize him (somebody from TV). I jump up to let him know I'm there and make excuse that I just stepped in to wipe dust off me or something. He lets me out and I sheepishly go on. At the end of the street there's sort of a shopping center with a Sanger's and I remember the bra sale. I run into Bill Wilding, who's waiting for me and asks me to take something with me to hand over to somebody I'm going to see. It's a bunch of what looks like hairpins, only not black. We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since. I am really let down and whiny. [Dream ends there, I think - but I also think it didn't begin there, there was more before.]"
"26"	"(1/23/86)"	"I'm trying to find the original plans or instructions to something and having no luck. There's a large ""file""-thing with shelves that rotate individually along the lines of the one at work but on a horizontal axis instead of vertical. I'm turning each shelf carefully because they all have different things on them but mostly (Mexican?) painted figures on them, even group displays, very nice things too. But no file. Somebody speaks to me, I think (she?) is saying it won't be there, (she's?) going to look elsewhere. I go a few yards away to something or other that's got some things in it I can look through - it makes me think of a bin. I sort of halfheartedly poke at them, then I get a half-formed picture of what I'm looking for, and a new approach - I may have missed it and will go back to look (in the file?). This is all outside, in a kind of courtyard, and there are people around."
"27"	"(1/26/86)"	"I was walking home with some little glass figures - some maybe little-fingernail size, others no more than twice that - I had some other things to carry and they were sort of loose on top of what I was carrying up against me, but I wasn't expecting that to stay secure, so as I walked I was transferring the bigger ones to my pocket, the smaller ones (where? coin purse?). Also apprehensive that they'd get broken from being jostled. When I get home I come into a perhaps duplex - it sort of tends to be the left side, or at least the front door is on the far left - anyway, it's a small living room furnished sort of college-student. I take the figures out and look for a place to put them, but just decide to put them with the others, on a very high shelf above the door - some are Christmas things, and I'm figuring you won't be seeing them all the time anyway, that's as good a way to store them as any. One of them, as I take it out and put it on the floor, is broken after all, but I'm not upset, I can glue it - I don't recognize what it's meant to be, it's a sort of wreath base with little wineglass-shapes that stand up on it. It's one of the wineglasses that's broken, but except for a sliver it'll go back together. I'm looking for the sliver (I think I've taken my skirt off by now - got a slip on) when my roommate comes in - she's young, blonde, short hair, pretty, sort of a popular-girl type - we're pretty good friends but not constant companions. We talk, but it's mostly chat and she's starting to take things off, too, when somebody else comes, at least 2, one male, who's maybe her brother or our brotherly other roommate. It's a little disconcerting to be sitting around not entirely clothed but at least we're decent, and they don't stay in that room."
"28"	"(1/26/86)"	"Lynn and Jane and I are at a LT function and they have something going on that they're upset about. Won't tell me what it is yet, but we're on our way back from the Training Room to (?) the Team Room, they're both gripy and stuck-acting. Testy. We're in a place that's bound to be a shopping mall, open space with bright lights, walkways, stairs or escalators. We get where we're going and there's other people there, one of whom is an officious little guy who is pissed off because (either Lynn or I) someone is wearing a pin or i.d. button that doesn't belong, it's much fancier than the others - I noticed it before but didn't see anything wrong with it - he takes it away and I'm wondering how it's going to get replaced with the right one. Some of the next little bit - don't know what it is, or who's talking - takes place by a small group of other people who are already in the ""Team Room"", and I don't know them but one turns out to be that guy from ""After Hours"" - Griffin Dunne, and I don't want to continue in front of him, so I move toward the ""door"" a bit so I'll be out of his line of vision."
"29"	"(1/26/86)"	"I have come from somewhere else to a house where some others taking a mastery class live, we're getting ready to go together. There's at least a brother and sister, maybe more. I move, with somebody else, to a sun/sitting room where the sister is - these people are recent grads and are expressing their apprehension of ""having"" to process all the time in the future so hard, it won't be any fun. I make a little speechie about how after you get used to it and good at it you don't work so hard and - although Roy doesn't think in these terms - gee whiz, you can go whole days without processing anything. And that eventually your mind gets trained not to react in the old way, so it's not as though it's a constant uphill struggle."
"30"	"(1/27/86)"	"Lifegame Roomset - small, high room - sort of an old school classroom, I think - pulling paper off a large board, taped to the sides - trying to do it neatly. The usual speech about setting it so they can get it. Soft carpet. Do we have something to put on the floor (like newspaper)? Outside room - a place where a lot of us are milling around, tables and benches, eating lunch. Is part of it outside or not? There's a kind of little terrace or platform - 3 or 4 steps up, then toilets to the left, maybe 4 or 5, and very busy. I need to go to the bathroom, and finally try to get up to one. Get beat out by a short-haired blonde girl. I guess I do get in shortly, and while I'm around here somebody is peeing and Sheryl J. is trying to read something out to a small group in front and has to ask for us to hold it a minute."
"31"	"(1/31/86)"	"They've been giving me parties at work because I'm going to work at PF temporarily - reason they need me is a new branch is being built and they're expanding - it looks like being permanent though, and I'm thinking I may as well not go back downtown at all - they may not want to give me more parties - PF has another problem - the construction people have struck oil - it's gushed once already and it's right next to where the building will be, so something major has to be revised before they can build. I'm talking to Belle and we go look at the oil eruption - looks like it broke up through the ground like a pimple or little volcano - I don't wanna get too close in case it spits up again, don't want it to land on me."
"32"	"(2/5/86)"	"Cats - moving from one place to another - two of them, somewhat awkward - not clear - at one point I go back to my family house and see my cat there? I'm feeling relieved that he/she is still there. While there I'm trying to use a device on the end of a hose, dirty, like car-repair tools are - you're supposed to press a little nub and (compressed air?) comes out. It's not working, and I go to a garage (or ?) and while the person I'm with talks to the mechanic I try out the one at the garage and it works so well I nearly fall over. Then I try mine again and it definitely doesn't work right. Sometime I go to a friend's house - I'm carrying something - she takes me to meet her parents - her father says he knows who I am and doesn't want me in his house - I think he says he doesn't want me around his daughter but he can't actually forbid her and I think she says so. He's not hot about it but very firm. My friend walks me outside and I've got an impression now of Kathie H. and/or Bobbie. Sort of hanging on me, and I'd rather get on my way."
"33"	"(2/6/86)"	"John Leveranz is around and is he trying on my clothes or what? I think so - I'm talking to him - don't know where we are but we're inside a building more like an office or school than anything else and something's between us and some other people - he's also looking at a bill that he's supposed to pay, it has my name on it and he remarks ""you're still married, aren't you?"", which is startling, until I realize that, yes, I am, I just don't like to think about it - I'm going back to the other people and he finishes (picking out clothes?) and when he's all dressed I'm secretly pleased that he should think I dress well because I have the silk shirt, etc. I'm wearing purple, something pretty hip but can't describe now. Later, LT people are cleaning up a house, being impeccable, natch - I'm doing something in the kitchen that involves a little figure of a mouse or rabbit like a Beatrix Potter. It's edible, in horizontal slices, and I want to leave it for Sue S. but as I eat the least crucial parts it gets shorter of course until I think it's no longer ok. There's a bit of yard up front of this place which doesn't seem to have a front wall and it's not grass, but rather loose dirt. I pick up a handful and look at it - it has bits in it, pieces of pecan, maybe other identifiable not-dirt. Wonder how it got there. I go back and sit at a table with somebody and Ann Morrison arrives. She's colored her hair dark and changed her makeup completely, new hairstyle, too - and looks great but nothing like usual. I'm impressed. She says something about it but I don't remember what - I'm thinking marriage has certainly been good for her."
"34"	"(2/8/86)"	"I blow up my house - there's nitro in a suitcase I have to be careful with and I do something wrong - I know it and have just enough time to get out. I manage to scream for Lick and don't see him but I think I see him shortly after - then I feel a little relieved, though not happy, that I got out alive and at least I didn't lose anybody, till I remember MB and Tree - then I'm (stunned? horrified?)"
"35"	"(2/8/86)"	"I've done something someone doesn't like but I've already gotten permission for it and when she leaves (we met on the steps of a building like a courthouse) I run into my (real supervisor?) and show her how I've verified this and she's satisfied - she approves of me and I'm confident and satisfied."
"36"	"(2/11/86)"	"I'm in a place in a downtown area, but not our downtown. (I have a feeling of it, how the town is smallish but not so small as to be rural.) The place doesn't seem like anything specific, not an office, but definitely not a residence of any kind - call it a waiting room. I have a sense of it being open to the street, but I don't see a lot of bright sunlight, or activity. Maybe it's just that the door's open, or there's windows. It's not big, or entirely empty, and I think the walls are red brick. There seems like benches are built along the walls. I'm sitting on one. I think there's something in the middle of the room. Don't know what. The street outside is a 2nd-string main street, busy but not the main drag. The buildings are close to the sidewalk and very ordinary brick faces. I arrived here by bus, standard city bus, and I'm not sure what my business is here. There are maybe 3 people in the place with me. At least one of them is a disc jockey, and one of them isn't. The one that isn't is kind of like Mike Rhyner, in that he's a buddy of these other guys and works with them but something he does is support for them (like research?) and he doesn't perform on the air, except maybe in his other capacity and not for entertainment. He and I are talking. Whatever we're talking about, we're getting along well and interested in what we're saying. The disc jockey isn't as involved but isn't hostile or unwilling for us to be talking. I get the impression, however, that I'm not ""in"" with him. I've left and gone (home?) and I'm not sure what the place is. (The previous place reminds me of a garage, and I'm not positive this place isn't similar.) Someone else is here, don't know who, and he definitely doesn't want me talking to the guy I was with. He doesn't approve of me interfering with him getting his job done. I know I wasn't. Don't think I say anything."
"37"	"(2/13/86)"	"I'm in a small house with my family - at least my brother and Mom, don't remember Dad -my brother's mad - it has something to do with jealousy - he says I did or got something I wasn't supposed to. He's not correct but I don't want him attacking me so I don't say anything but I start to pack up and leave - I don't have much, I think this is like a rented vacation house and I came here last. Mom says no, I don't have to leave and I stop, but Marcy gets madder and he leaves. He's so mad we look out the window after him to be sure he isn't going to sneak back and jump us, through the roof or the back door. Next I think a blond young man comes to the house but if so I don't know what he does."
"38"	"(2/13/86?)"	"Mom and I are in a restaurant - it's got sort of a garden decor, all greens and yellows and white. The table is loaded with dishes and I've finished eating, so the idea is to get the tray of dishes off the table (my side anyway). To do this I balance it on my forehead and try to lower to the floor. Doesn't work. I can only get so far before I know if I move anymore it'll slide off, break the dishes and probably slice my forehead. Mom calls for the waiters and maybe maitre d' to get it off me. Afterward we get dessert - I wasn't going to have any but she ordered it as a treat. What I could see (it was on top of a pile of something) was white - I tried that and it turned out to be whipped cream on top of something to do with strawberries. While there, I'm looking at a long color brochure of things from the Container Store or - no, Crate and Barrel. Lots of red and blue stuff - brochure folds out, and this restaurant may be inside the store. One or both of these places may be located in Inwood Village - more or less at the Penney's location."
"39"	"(2/14/86)"	"Somewhere I'm getting rated according to something odd, and I come out well - there's a gap in the grades that I'm aware of for some reason - like it's easy for people to fall in between and thereby slide up. I seem to be with Karen."
"40"	"(2/14/86)"	"I'm with a group of women at a place we're staying maybe like a retreat for vacation. Somebody has stolen something, I think, and very slim evidence points to Jean Yocum (or somebody, at least an older woman), and I think somebody else. There's a scene in which the group accuses her/them and says she/they have to go. I'm rather put out at this because there's been no attempt made to prove their guilt, not even to give them a chance to say if they did it. At some point I've gone someplace or been distracted but I have plenty of opportunity to speak up about it. I keep ""rehearsing"" what I'll say the way I do in real life, and never get to that point before the dream ends. After the accusation scene breaks up, I go into the bathroom to gather my stuff, and either something spills or there's a puddle on the floor for some reason, and I gather things up. I'm sort of packing things up to go myself."
"41"	"(2/14/86)"	"Takes place on an artificial planet - it's smaller than the world but of course you can't see that. It has a roof, but it's so high that the place can have weather and so forth. I'm with Erv, who wants me to see something - we're ""outside"" now and going to where he lives - there is a sense of something coming to an end - not the ""planet"", or me, but I think now it must be him (caused by him being about to retire?). As we're going along I'm looking up at the sky, which has a funny color, but there are trees, that move with the wind, and birds. As I look there's a great group of birds flying across the sky, as a flock of birds will mass in flight, but it's all different sorts of birds! You can see from their sizes and silhouettes that there's every kind of bird in that group. It's amazing, that here on this place they will all do things together - just because it's different. Erv and I look for a bit and marvel, then he says let's go and as we go it starts to rain. I've been here a while and I'm conscious of how amazing it is that it can rain inside this artificial world. I start laughing/crying in delight. We get where we're going, which is a kind of apartment that Erv shares with a bunch of other people. He motions me into his room and goes to get whatever it is he wants me to see and I never find out what it is. There are other people in the apartment, and they're together talking, and this is typical for here."
"42"	"(2/14/86)"	"I'm with my mother and somebody else, talking about the Training and how it costs so much money and how it could be raised - my mom says something that fits in and says ""yes, I want to take it too, but..."" (""I don't know how I can get the money"", whatever). I'm surprised."
"43"	"(2/15/86)"	"I'm with a group of LT people, at least mainly women - not sure if it's a hotel or not but we have baggage and one of us I don't recognize is looking for sheets (or something) to buy if anybody has some. She leaves to ask somebody outside the room where I am. Someone else opens a suitcase to check what she's got and leafs through it. As she does I see a yellow blanket that looks like it may be wool and since there's an indication that she may be up for selling this stuff, I check. It is wool, and I ask if she wants to sell this. It turns out to be Sharon Clements. She says maybe, and I ask how much. I also check the label again to be sure it's a double. (I've also been thinking it's a shame it's yellow, I'm not that fond of it, but it'll go with my bedroom well enough.) When I ask, she clouds up a little and doesn't answer. After a bit, she says it's not me, it was just when I asked her and she really thought about selling it, a wave of (sorrow? - it's not my feeling) came over her, and she'd like to go clear. There's somebody here acting as Team Support (though a Training isn't going on right now) and we go across the room where she is. [The place seems more like it's old or unfinished - at first it could've been backstage, now this room reminds me of the lake house we stayed in] This girl is sitting on the bed, with her back to us - she's blond, and Sharon says her name but I don't remember and she doesn't look familiar. She's friendly and is going to work with us, when the scene changes to a bus. We've just got on and are choosing seats. Sharon sits right behind the driver and I sit a bit down so the other girl can sit in between but before she does we see a couple, married, we know them a bit or somehow know of them, and we speak to them first - they're also here to be on the team. We all sit except the man, who starts pontificating by way of taking over this clearing. He is making sense but it isn't his business, and the other girl breaks into his speech, joining in with the words, which disturbs him, and she eventually subdues him, I think - she also turns to me and says adamantly not to interfere (I can't remember the words) and I say I would never dream of it - or it hadn't entered my mind. The wife reappears and says some hostile things about her husband - says he has officially (but that wasn't the word) forbidden her from using ""Mrs"" before her name, even though they are legally married - ""he seems to forget that we..."" is what she says. This is after she says her name by way of introduction."
"44"	"(2/15/86)"	"I work in a place with a lot of money (a bank?) and it's being robbed - this place is like a lot of buildings, nicely kept up on the bottom, less finished and junky at the top - a couple of other people and I are trying to do something outside without locking ourselves out - seems to be difficult. Involves short flights of stairs and heavy doors that won't stay open. I'm with a female (black?) and a male. Back inside, somehow I get an opportunity to thwart the thieves - I get hold of at least some major part of the money and run with it. Somebody I know is with the robbers, maybe helping them voluntarily, I'm not sure - but I figure he can tell where I'll go so I have to outwit him. I run down a hall and pass where I would go, down to a room with a lot of painter's and plastering stuff in it. I stash the money under a pile of cloths on the floor, next to a cabinet or something which is just inside left of the door. Back outside and down to the other door where I hope they'll see me just going in - then I think no, I may as well hide if I have a chance. I go further in (it's open and leads into other rooms as if, in a house, you've got living rooms that lead into dining rooms but big open passages rather than doorways? - best I can do - hold the image) and there are 2 people, Cynthia and another woman, who must also be blind because she doesn't react to me. Neither does, they must not hear me either and they're both motionless. I don't look for any good place to hide because the robbers are coming in - I duck as close to this inner wall as I can, hoping they won't come this way - but my right arm sticks out sideways at an angle and I can't get it down. If I move it fast they'll see me move it and I can't seem to inch it gradually. (I think Cynthia leaves in here somewhere.) So one of the men sees me and comes over, but he's not the one to interrogate me, he's an underling, so he's just going to let them know I'm here. He says ""Stand here"" and turns back to the others, moving away from me. I look around, see another room and duck into it quietly. It's green and a lot like the junky old office in the basement of the old building - no one's redecorated here in a hundred years. At first I think it's a lost cause but by George it's got a door on the other side. I thought it might lead to the hall but it doesn't - I don't know where it leads but one way or another I get into an office, where there are rows of people (like there used to be) with adding machines and typewriters - men and women - and I know I'm n home free. What I want is to get to the police on the ground floor, but I'm afraid of getting caught before I reach them. I keep running. When I wake up I'm still worried I'm not going to make it - sense of desperation."
"45"	"(2/15/86)"	"Not much left - I'm with (my brother) in a car, him driving, that stops going for unknown reason - I get out and encounter puppies - they're sort of spilling out of a storm drain, very small, very ""duh""-looking. I think they're kind of cute but say they shouldn't be out like that, they'll get hurt, and put them back. Then Momma starts to growl a bit of warning, she hadn't been visible before, but now she comes forward as if she's been crouching at the back of the drain (as if it were a litter cave). I say hi to her and go on. Where I am is rather like a cul-de-sac or circle. We've come from a street, and behind some building, maybe apartments, the road runs by the back and turns round into a fair-sized short underpass, which is where the puppies are. I'm aiming to continue that way."
"46"	"(2/15/86)"	"LT again - the scene is something like the balcony at work. I've finished with a hair dryer that I'm trying to wrap up again and after a couple of times do it and it wads up a bit but it's ok and I leave it. Somewhere in here I've been singing, rather like those fantasies I have where I start a song as an example for the group of how I can sing and they let me go on - it's something more like a story this time, though, and I made up the words and it was great though I haven't the foggiest notion what it was. I think this is where I hug a guy who looks a bit like Joe A."
"47"	"(2/15/86)"	"A LT is starting ( or Prep Night) in a room that looks like an old-time school - wood everywhere and we even seem to be dressed for the setting. It's all disorganized, people aren't in their places on time and part of the reason is that some other sort of class is going on next door that overlaps and the ones in the LT have to be let go from it, so they trickle in after we've started."
"48"	"(2/20/86)"	"I'm in a car with Dan, William Shatner, and somebody else - Shatner's driving. We're all talking and there's a car coming the other way rather badly, and I turn around to watch it. Sure enough, it hits another car head-on and I watch carefully because it's the first wreck I've ever actually seen in person. I remark this to the others, but when I turn around again there's nothing to see, both cars still drive and they're going round a corner to deal with the insurance, etc. Meanwhile there's a parked car in our lane and I remind Shatner of it, I don't think he's paying attention. He says it's ok. We get where we're going, but I don't know if it's a house or what. Later I'm at a party. Seems to be a costume party, and I've got on something rather elegant. I'm milling around looking for somebody to talk to, and I know a lot of these people but I don't feel comfortable and mostly I just greet them and let them go on and look for somebody who I'm sure wants to be with me. Eventually I go up some stairs, wide and curving - this is a posh place - and come into a long wide hallway or lobby rather like the ones in hotels outside the ballrooms, with couches and coffee tables. Some other people are there. One of them (but not noticeably Bonnie) knows I've been having trouble with my neck; I think she thinks it's my back. She wants me to try to bend backwards the way we did the other night for a stretch, and I don't want to really try it. Partly it's because I don't want to appear weak, partly because I don't want to find I can do it and be seen to be all right after all - which is partly because I'll be thought of as faking it. Dan and Lynn and Jane and Ken appear and I think, they will help me out here - maybe I can join them now and get away from these people's attention - they know I s____ (I can't describe what I think except that I think of their presence as rescue from the situation.) Later I step (duck?) into a bathroom that's fortuitously unoccupied (this place has been busy) and poke around some. The light's very dim, I don't look for a switch. It's longer than usual, quite fancy, shower stall, and something's interesting that's left of the door. Don't know what it is that I'm wanting to see closer, but I step in and find the floor all squishy. It's been leaking again, bad. This (thing - closet? shower stall? other mechanism?) has been repaired, big-time, and I think it's looking pretty shabby - I'm thinking of Mary Tod, this is her place, and classy people like her aren't supposed to have leaky bathrooms. I wonder if I should back out in case it wants to fall on my head, but I want a closer look at something inside and step in."
"49"	"(2/22/86)"	"I'm at a small rather shabby wood-frame house with a porch. The second room on the porch is mine. I'm with other people and there are guests or somebody like visitors anyway. There's some organized affair going on, don't know what. Some of these visitors are in the first room (my brother's?) and they decide to go through the connecting door to my room to (confer?) and I don't want them to. I firmly explain that they're to stay in this room. My brother has a confrontation with a mysterious stranger - blonde man - My brother prevails (though it wasn't a fight) and he (or we?) have to figure out what to do with him"
"50"	"(2/23/86)"	"A woman with at least a couple of kids lives in a Dickensian sort of tenement and gets thrown out because she can't pay the rent. It's tough but not the first time or the worst thing that could happen. We go along to another place where the landlord is more generous and frankly this place is nicer and in better condition than the last anyway. It looks rustic - landlord leads us round to our entrance and inside, where there's an intricate stair arrangement - I think of England, where there can be found these very shallow steps that turn and twist but there's even more here - you don't actually need to take them, you can leap several. We go up that way, rather than following the line back and forth. Also I'm on a bus going to a shopping center. Lots of people on, and I'm sitting all the way in the back. I get a phone call. I'm not surprised that there's a phone, but I think it's rather a disturbance and didn't expect them to actually have me take the call here. It's a girl who also works for the City and I don't really understand what she wants but she obviously thinks I'm in the office and is a little bit annoyed to find that I'm not. Also perplexed - we don't know each other and there's some doubt that she's even got the right number. The bus arrives at the shopping center and there's an Army-recruit thing going on in the parking lot. Turns out there's a lot of new recruits on this bus and they're meant to get off and join their group, so we have to wait a bit while that gets organized. I get off - speak to somebody but don't remember what about except that there's a question whether I'm one of them."
"51"	"(2/25/86)"	"I'm in the front of a bus with a friend, we have an errand or purpose together wherever we're going - there's another girl near us, sitting down (we're standing) and she's at odds with us in some way - perhaps we're suspicious of her, as though she were prying into our business. It's either night or late afternoon, and we're all dressed as if for work, and I believe we have coats on, maybe even hats and gloves. I'm sure we're all three ""girls""."
"52"	"(2/25/86)"	"I am a superhero with a costume, cape, and everything, except I'm not terrific at it - the costume is light-colored and not flashy - I don't fly but I do swing from a rope. I'm with someone - not rescuing him but we're about some business, and I'm swinging us from one spot to a rooftop - not high but quite slanted. Red tile. Another man is there already, he had a task of his own and we're joining him - we sort of all crash together and it's an awkward picture of us all trying to get our footing on the roof at one time. I don't know why I know it's me, since the caped crusader is a man, but I'm pretty sure. Scenery's nice - old-world village, sort of."
"53"	"(2/26/86)"	"A LT event of some sort, in a small school auditorium - this one is not old, it's pretty much like the ones I went to (say 5th grade). John Boats is talking and I get called away shortly after it starts - I was sitting down front - and don't get back until it's almost over. He's doing Hot Potato, and I'm getting really pissed off because I missed everything. I'm struggling not to blame somebody else. Leaving, we're not going home, though, just to lunch, and I guess we're coming back - we're walking down the hall talking about what to do for lunch."
"54"	"(2/26/86)"	"I'm on a residential street - I've come from the next street over, through the houses, and I'm looking for an address. These are not family homes but sort of semi-apartments, maybe duplexes or four-plexes, upscale, newish. I go a house or two down the street and look at one, then enter up a few steps to an entry of sorts - seems like different apartments open off the landing. There are people about, but no one to take any notice of me, they're sort of talking amongst themselves like a Sunday afternoon barbecue or something. I'm not trying to hide but I'm not anxious for anyone to take any notice of me, either. I look to my left on the landing; someone (male, dark shirt and casual trousers) is just going in a door, where there seems to be a bit of traffic. I duck back out of any line of sight, being cautious (my familiar way) of being seen. I do, however, have business here."
"55"	"(2/27/86)"	"I'm at Mom's house - bedroom. I've put stuff on her bed and there's already a large pile of her laundry on it - room is mostly green - Mom and Marcy are at work. I'm doing something in another room, it's a sunny room, living room or den. (Don't remember what I'm doing.) Suddenly I have to leave, or at least it's time to get my stuff picked up before M and M come home. I go back in the bedroom and start to grab stuff but I get hold of her laundry and mess it up. Very frustrating. They come home before I get finished anyway. There's no trouble, actually. We say something to each other but I don't know what."
"56"	"(2/26/86)"	"I'm on a bus, sitting forward, with my shawl on, reading a book. The aisle's getting crowded, and a woman passes by me wearing the same shawl. I say, ""How nice, where did you get yours?"" - I think she doesn't say, but somehow she indicates it was expensive and I think that's kind of neat, I didn't know that. I mention I got mine at a garage sale, she says nice going. The bus makes a big jolt, maybe the driver slammed on the brakes. A little kid falls down and hurts herself, everybody goes ""awww"" and the driver decides to take her along to the hospital. We're on the edge of downtown now and a detour to the hospital wouldn't be much. Seems to me somebody will object, though. There is now a companion with me who-may-be-Lori-but-isn't-quite, and 3 (4?) other girls who are noticeable, and they move where I can see them (into the space so they can move, I expect) and start doing a ""No"". L and I are surprised and pleased and say to one of them who's not proceeding, ""Do you want support?"" She nods, I guess, and we start ""No""-ing with her - doesn't last long. This girl, when she first came up, turned her back on everybody. The others didn't. I thought that interesting. I also think there's something different, off-putting, about the others. L and I talk to this one and she's a little reticent. We're not on the bus anymore, but inside a building. Maybe a waiting station of some sort - it's large and has standard glass doors in the corners, and it's located out there in Baylor territory. It's night now - the bus ride was late afternoon, after work. I've got the idea this girl has done est and want to tell her about LT, but it turns out she did do LT and isn't working comfortably with it. She doesn't come to things because of money. L and I talk to her about that - we're anxious to get to know her because we admire a person who'll do a ""No"" in public. We go outside of this building during the conversation, and when I get to the door I see the city skyline, all lit up like the Whatsit building. I see one building crack sideways and fall down. How neat. I call the others' attention to it, and as we watch, the whole cityscape breaks up and juggles itself around before completely falling down. It's like a chaotic dance. Wonderful. This girl is reticent about coming out to play but we encourage her."
"57"	"(2/27/86)"	"I'm moving in with a family - part of my original family already lives here, presumably I've got other, younger brothers and sisters. They've been taken in out of necessity. I've still got options to moving in here but not attractive ones - except they're getting more attractive. The head of this family is a hail-fellow type who's really concerned about me and a TV set - seems to think I'll really be pleased that, coming here, I'll have my own color TV - but not a big one, or a fancy one, he wants to warn me about that. I remark that I did have one, it's not even color, but it's not as if I've been deprived you know."
"58"	"(3/2/86)"	"Woke up frightened. I come to my front door, find it open - don't think anything of it at first, then not sure, so I turn away and an arm grabs me from the opposite side. I croak ""Help"" as loud as I can but it's not very loud and though I know there's people to hear me I'll have to shout. I try to breathe and call out but I can't. I know I've got to do it soon but nothing comes out."
"59"	"(3/2/86)"	"Having a meeting or class at my apartment - Brad Brown is here. (Not this apartment.) Very informal. As we get ready to break up everybody talks about who's going with whom. The young man I came with seems to be dubious about us going together but says ok, and I talk to some other people on the ""porch"" outside (all concrete or stone, including steps and side wall, no rail). Then I realize that since he drove me here why would I go with him? So I tell him it's ok, go on without me."
"60"	"(3/2/86)"	"I'm sitting next to a girl and a young blonde guy, looking hip (like the guy at the play but prettier) - we're gossiping and she says look who we've got gracing our party (is that what this is?) - she means this guy and points. I don't recognize him and she ID's him as an actor who's well known from one of the nighttime soaps, only there he looks rather preppy-ish. He's sullen, reminds me of Michael J. Pollard. I'm popping my little finger by pulling it out - whenever I do that the last joint comes off but there's another next time. I'm very amused by all this."
"61"	"(3/3/86)"	"A conspiracy - really insidious - purpose unknown. I'm with (my brother?) in a tiny house and there's been someone else here. There are some really strange guys been looking for that other person (a young boy) and my brother doesn't know what they want but I'm afraid I do. They won't necessarily hurt anybody but you can't be sure and I've gotten very paranoid. I tell my brother and we start talking about plans to get away and I even think about starting over somewhere with different hair and clothes, etc., it's depressing. While we're talking I'm breaking a couple eggs on the counter and scraping them into a dish or something - we're trying to look busy."
"62"	"(3/5/86)"	"I come into a restaurant with my ""family"" - there's not many people here - it's small and cozy - we've been here before - I have a small bag with me, I think it's awkward to be bringing it in here, especially since I've also got another small suitcase that's old-looking, with a stripe and a makeshift handle on the end rather than in the middle. We sit at a small table and start a conversation with the waiter. There's some disagreement here but not major - I'm the one going somewhere to stay, like, say, I was going to gramma's for the summer - so I feel odd man out. The waiter brings wine - for some reason it's an incredibly expensive bottle (like on the TV show I saw last night) and it wasn't exactly bought - maybe a gift - maybe this is an anniversary dinner for ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". I remark on the new arrangement of the tables - different sizes, even, from the last time we were here - now all little round ones scattered around. They think I'm wrong but I know where we sat last time. There's an interval and ""Dad"" and ""little brother"" go somewhere - I'm talking to ""Mom"", who's sitting on a couch - I decide this is a moment that calls for the wine, so I pour 2 glasses - one for her, one for him - I don't want any. I take it to her, saying I thought this was the moment for an incredibly, (something, something) - even embarrassingly - expensive - glass of wine. She's surprised at first, very dubious as to whether to drink it, it's so expensive. I'm thinking, what are you going to do with it?"
"63"	"(3/8/86)"	"I've gone off in a car with my grandparents and a great-aunt for a Thanksgiving drive somewhere. The direction seems to be north, as though I still live in San Paulo. We're going to stop somewhere for Thanksgiving dinner. On the way we stop at a roadside ""garage sale"" where there's a lot of old furniture and things - it's actually Lurline's, she's finally decided to get rid of a lot of stuff she doesn't need - there are pieces I don't recognize - also an old doll or baby crib, very small - I suggest buying it to someone (Dan?) who's also there at the moment, because maybe someone you know will have a baby and it would make a nice present. There are also nice lace/linen collars and kitchen things - a white enamel affair on legs that's narrow and meant to fit in small places and the top sort of folds up - I thought at first it was for storage but now I don't know - ""Dan"" is quite thrilled with it, says his family used to have one. I'm looking at the price tags - they're small, oval white stick-ons, written by hand as you see often on antiques. Either the scene changes or we get back in the car and go to the next place, which is parked in front of Dad and my stepmothre's house in a small town. They have prospered since I last saw them, developing a large new family with grown kids, brothers and sisters, wealth, fame, power - big house, nice street, neighbors. [This may be the same place as Lurline's garage sale, just revised.] There seems to be a garage sale going on here, too - lots of people about - in fact, whole groups arrive and depart, maybe they even take tours or they're on one. Even the neighbors are all outside because, I guess, the holiday is a celebration and it's like one huge party. I'm looking at a lace collar that's on the ground on top of a paper or towel or something - it has a dark spot on it that I find is wetness, and it disappears rapidly if you get something under it to absorb, but gets wet again in another place quickly - the ground is wet. I'm by myself now, my grandparents and great-aunt have gone to look at something else, and I discover where we are - not sure how, maybe I heard somebody say, or I saw Dad or My stepmother on their way into the house, but I know and I'm horrified. I'm figuring that it would be a good idea to leave, but don't know if I can persuade the others. I look around for them and find they've started talking to these people and figure I'd better not interrupt lest it be discovered I'm here. They may not have spilled the beans. I find now I have to skulk. When I go to peek to see where the others went, I run into a young man member of the household who may want to know what I'm doing. What I do to respond involves brushing my teeth. (Maybe I asked him for the bathroom.) His room is in the right front part of the house and I continue across the house like a spy, trying not to be seen, until I come out the other side. I quickly go back around to the front and blend in with all the other people there. (The neighbors are out on their front porch.) The ""garage sale"" is coming to an end - crowds starting to thin out. I'm beginning to feel conspicuous, since everyone else will be gone and I'll be hanging around on the lawn. I lean behind a tree facing the street, fairly well hidden from the house, though there are people to my right, including one woman from the house who's watching everybody just sort of fondly, at the end of a nice family get-together. If she takes any notice of me she doesn't say anything. I stand there for a long, long time. I'm waiting for them to come and take me away from here and feeling abandoned. (Real familiar.) I'm sure they've forgotten I'm here. I can't go looking for them because the ""family"" will find out I'm here and ask me questions and talk about me and I still won't get to leave. I'm feeling devastated. As the hours go on I move from the tree to a (rocking?) chair on the porch, staring out toward the street, trying to be invisible. I realize they must have gone inside and been invited to have Thanksgiving dinner and not bothered about me. They either assume I can take care of myself or it's okay for me to sit outside and isolate myself. I'm telling myself what really happened, though, is they got in the car and drove off and don't know I'm not with them. They'll find out soon and come back for me. But it doesn't happen, and I sit there. Something strange happens to the scene I'm looking at - or I'm thinking about a movie I've seen - anyway, I see a gym with a bunch of Tom-Cruise-type boys in a movie scene that looks like one I've seen but isn't quite - then I become aware that I'm watching a trailer for the sequel. Something about a piece of equipment in this scene is of importance, has to do with me and somehow Linda. I (call her?) on the telephone - at least I've got a phone in my hand and I'm talking to her on it and we exchange the information, and she asks if I'm okay, or maybe it's can she do anything else for me? I've been thinking about how I could get home on my own now, it's been so long I don't know why I should wait here forever, and I'm getting real mopey. I ask her about that and start to tell her everything, when all of a sudden I hear people behind me coming outside - the sort of bustle you get when a group of people leave. I hear Bonnie's voice - she comes beside where she can see me and says ""Oh, there you are! We've been wondering where you got off to."" And asks a question that might have been, how come you disappeared like that? Or something, but she doesn't quite finish - turns her head back to the others and says, ""oh, I know - I know you too well"". I'm absolutely horrified that it should be turning out this way. I mumble something to Linda and hang up. I wait for this new ordeal to be over."
"64"	"(3/12/86)"	"I'm at the office - it's bigger than usual, with more people, and busier. 3 young men come in and confront a group of people I'm with - they have guns and seem to want something but I don't know what. I break away from them and go out to the middle where a lot of people can see me and vice versa, and I start yelling something for help - it doesn't get anybody's attention the first time, so I do it some more. This starts people moving - mostly they leave, but somehow in the confusion the intruders are subdued and going to be arrested. As they're being taken away I talk to one of them and I'm sympathetic - these guys are just kinda sad and pathetic, not tough or mean. He thanks me for stopping them. I have an idea that his other partners join him after a minute and say goodbye too. Not sure."
"65"	"(3/12/86)"	"There's an outdoor fair of some kind. Loretta's there and has something in a bag she wants to share since somebody else didn't or couldn't take it. We talk to somebody. I have to go somewhere for a while - it involves riding home on a bicycle and doing some errands. I'm going to return some books in the OL chute but as I go into the drive I see Muriel [Brown] , wearing red pants, (and some other woman), standing in the driveway, I guess just passing through. Rather than go past her to the chute and have to speak, I cruise past at a distance and don't return the books. There is some question about doing an errand at a much greater distance, but I conclude I don't want to go all that way on a bicycle - though I can - today, since I want to get back to the fair. I also go into a restaurant. I'm not intending to stay, but somehow I do have a cup of coffee or something and am pleased about it. The waiter (this place is in the neighborhood somewhere, and the waiter, if not gay, is young and in keeping with the atmosphere) brings the check and, oddly enough, change as well. There's a stack of coins on the check - or is it 2, as an alternative? - in the amount of $1, in case you want to make your own change. I'm concerned about the bill, since (as is presently true) I only have $1 and some change on me. It crosses my mind that I could just take this money but I decide not to and go back to the fair."
"66"	"(3/13/86)"	"Melanie is with me, looking at my crowded bedroom area - it's in a place that's not all mine - other people live here, but it's not just a house - more like the open-office arrangements. My area is stuffed full of things, and there's only 1 electrical outlet. I've just brought in a new lamp and rearranged the extension cord arrangement, which is wonky. I go somewhere for a bit, or turn my back, and Melanie rearranges it again so it's clumsy and obtrusive, so I have to put it back. She's noticing things I have since she last saw, especially 2 tennis rackets. I'd got them on sale somewhere familiar (as in close proximity, like the Library Store), and I hate to pass up a real bargain even if I have no immediate use for it."
"67"	"(3/13/86)"	"I have been in this place before, a flea-market sort of place with banks of booths inside a larger building, like Big D Bazaar. I'd gotten something here I liked a lot, in the way of jewellery, I think, from an older guy, a craftsman, in a middle booth. I want another one, so I've come to see if he's in, but I can see that nobody's open, all the places are empty and covered up. It's not out of business, just closed for Sunday or whatever. Still I walk all the way around in case. I see a few people in the open space (like the concession area) - one of them is the guy I'm looking for, and he's facing off another guy about his own age and type - some other men are sitting down watching. I can see they're about to have a fight. They're angry, but not enraged (yet), and the fight is structured. I think they're going to use swords, but not fancy or sharp ones, and they're not trained swordsmen. I don't want to see them do this, so I'm gonna duck out."
"68"	"(3/14/86)"	"I'm at work but maybe not actually my office - doesn't look it. I'm on the phone with a branch manager who's trying to handle a book returned in some way she couldn't handle - wanted to know how to handle it and somehow it's turned around - it's Friday and she can't raise anybody for advice. She's pissed, she's gotten me by trying to locate somebody ""official"" who'll know what to do. I tell her I used to work at PF and OL and I know what to do more or less but I did know I could get hold of someone who could tell me for sure - thinking of Ann rather than Alma. She keeps rattling and the connection gets bad - I have to keep asking her to repeat. She's dubious about whether I know what I was talking about - if I really worked at a branch? which branch? - like that - till I had to be firm and try to get her to let me either put her on hold or call her back."
"69"	"(3/14/86)"	"I'm with a group of people together for a purpose - we're going out for lunch break and drive to a restaurant (or go in a van provided by the restaurant) that we'd been ""sold"" on by this Mexican woman - it's further than I imagined it would be, and when we get there it doesn't look like one. It's through a house, and the house is high off the street. Bit of a climb to get there, then we all get led into the house. A room we go through is very uneven - there are steps in it, different places. I'm lagging behind the others, and so is another woman - we have a kind of familiarity - some similar experiences that we talk about, something to do with this room."
"70"	"(3/14/86)"	"A man is being chased by another man who means to kill him - I can see it all as if it's a movie. The killer isn't mad to kill him, just determined, as if he's a hit man. The other guy is nice looking, I believe I know him, and he's clever and has been able to outwit the other guy [the killer] up to now. He's still looking for a way to duck out of sight. They are walking, outside in a downtown area, where there's crowds of people, so the bad guy can't just run after the other and shoot him down. But he's getting closer. At one point the good guy struts across an intersection to fit in with other people, and the bad guy does the same. Finally the bad guy really does catch up, and turns the other to face him. The good guy seems a little bit nervous, but you can see he's trying to look at ease and amused. Typical adventure hero. He takes the gun the bad guy's holding, not out of his hand, but with his hand and moves his whole arm around some way that resembles locking arms to drink champagne romantically. Ends up with the gun pointed at his own cheek. So it appears he's going to do the job for the hit man, in a way, but he's got a little smile on his face and I realize that what'll happen when he pulls the trigger is the gun will pull the hand around and the hit man will be shot instead. (Dream ends before that happens but my reaction is a bit of tension whether that'll work or not.)"
"71"	"(3/15/86)"	"I'm in a room in an old building, maybe a school, but it's a small place and not in a place with lots of people - in fact, this room is being used for some temporary project and if it is a school, that's not going on now. The floor is bare wood and it's darkish - all the walls and everything have been left alone a long time (but not abused). There are 4 or 5 people working on something here, maybe sorting things or packing things up. I'm lying on my bed in the corner. There's a reason why I'm not joining in but I'm not sure if it's just because there's not enough for me to do or they're almost finished or what. Someone comes to ask me that, in fact, and I feel a tiny bit guilty but I know I don't really need to be doing anything. I'm thinking of an object I haven't seen for a while, some kind of figurine or toy that I used to have around all the time and I miss it. I wonder where it is and I get up to pull the bed out from the wall to look for a box underneath. To do that I have to pull out the heater that stands next to it - old, tired, taller than usual, that gold/bronze color. I get the box and look at the things inside - there are several such articles as the one I was thinking of, that I'd had around before but put away and forgotten about. (I see them clearly and can identify them, but here where I'm writing I can't.) I'm delighted to see them again - they're old friends. I get up, put the box on the bed, and push it back. I have trouble with the heater, though - it sticks on the floor and there's a woman in the room - she's someone I work with, maybe my boss but this is all very informal - says maybe I'd better get somebody to help, that thing's pretty rickety. (The others have left by now, just we two in the room.) I say that it's just getting to move and I give it another shove. It doesn't fall over, but rather crumples from the bottom and the top comes off and another inside piece falls off. I look at it and see that it can be put back together but it'll have the dent in front where it crumpled. Poor old thing was on its last legs anyway. No great loss."
"72"	"(3/16/86)"	"I'm in a big hotel with a group of people who are doing something special, the way LT is, but it's not that. Part of it involves sitting at a desk or table, a long one, like rows of people at desks or tables, keeping track of something or some kind of current paperwork. Sometimes you get up to do something else, or maybe it's a break. I get up to go with some people going to exercise, or swim. There's some activity at my place and I know I have to get back on time. When we get to the other place, it's as though it's someone else's house. The others I'm with decide not to swim but I definitely feel I need to work out, so I go to change my clothes. I find I haven't got all my stuff with me. I thought I had tights but I don't and I have to put on my leotard with the relatively loose leather pants I took off before. This is taking up time and I'm worried I won't get in enough exercise before I have to go back. Worse still, I have to pee first. I aim for where I know a pool is - the place at this point is laid out in a curve, so I follow it round - by the time I get there, it's really bad, and I'm further worried about the time I'm having to spend at this - I go around a corner and see a men's room and think, okay, there must be a ladies' nearby - but no such luck - I keep going down to where the restaurant is. I've been here before, and I'm frustrated because I know there is a ladies', but it's in the far right corner after you go into the restaurant. I wonder for a second if I should keep looking, but I go down to it anyway, and it's crowded. I figure I just can't wait anymore, and I take some toilet-paper squares (as they turned out to be) off the top of the paper-towel dispenser, go to a corner where nobody can see me for a minute, and pee. Presumably on the floor but it didn't make any noise, and I'm wearing a skirt now. I blot myself off quick and leave, crossing the restaurant to the opposite door as a shortcut to get back where I'd been."
"73"	"(3/17/86)"	"I'm in a nice old house that's mine (but am I renting?) by myself and it has big rooms and a big yard and a garage. I've just come in and some other people have left - I go to the bedroom, which has a big window with curtains. There's a bum outside the window who comes right next to it and lays down as if to sleep there. (He knows I see him.) I'm uneasy about this. There are other such people in the back yard. I think they have business like they're helping build something maybe. I get up and (close the curtains?) go to find the phone book so I can call the landlord and tell him about this and ask what to do. But I can't find the number - he's unlisted. I know we got hold of him before, me and a friend, when I moved in, but that was through somebody else - a relative or something. I'm going to try, though. I go to the front of the house for something - to answer the door? And come back through the bedroom, noticing how big it is - the house isn't great big, but the rooms are. I go to the window and look out, checking to see if the bums are watching. I'm getting down on my stomach to peek under the curtain and see if the one guy is still lying there, and he is. I'm a little disturbed. However,somewhere I'm looking at earrings and thinking, ""I'm really going to get my ears pierced, today!"" And I'm thrilled about it - I feel my ears and imagine how it will hurt for a bit and then how it will feel to have earrings in, and how I can get long, dangly, neat ones. (Frankly, I think I'm in the same house, same scene, but I don't know how.)"
"74"	"(3/21/86)"	"I'm in a supermarket-type department store like Target with MB - I'm putting things down her throat, as if I'm teaching her sword-swallowing. One thing is a sort-of knife but I see it has a collapsible blade that recedes when I try to get it in her mouth. I also see toothpaste and toothbrushes, including one that contains toothpaste (for travelling) - you fold up a section of a plastic tab at the bottom and it squeezes toothpaste out for you. I hold onto MB - I assume she'll struggle, but she likes it, rather. I brush away at her teeth but we have somewhere to be. And I'm arriving at a hotel with several clumsy pieces of luggage - it's convoluted and odd, and there's a lot of questionable people here. A man leads me in and tells me where I'm to go. It's up several flights - I'm not thrilled having to lug this stuff. As I go up the stairs I see various people, some of whom watch. The stairs twist and turn, but not in a regular pattern with regular landings. I get to one and put my stuff down, then go along the hall a bit to see if I can see how much farther. I'm just briefly out of sight of my luggage, but there wasn't anybody in sight when I put it down. When I turn back it's gone. I dash back and down the stairs, looking round as I go, even farther than I think anybody would've gotten. People are looking at me but not with curiosity, rather more like they know what's going on and don't think it's unusual. I'm not angry or terribly upset. And I'm at the library - I think I didn't realize that at first - I'm leaving, and I'm in the lobby. (Doesn't look like ours, exactly, but the ceilings are real high.) It's just changed, matter of fact - the remodelling has started, and everything's been moved out - what I see is a crowd of stuff at a distance that looks more like it's in boxes - no detail. Lot of indirect lighting. I'm wondering where everybody's gone and how they can check out books. While I'm there, Alma's voice is heard over the loudspeaker, announcing closing and about checking out materials now - didn't pay attention to what she said."
"75"	"(3/29/86)"	"I am outside, in the midst of a few small frame houses that may be out in the country, but not far out - certainly they're not in town. It's very ""family"" out here, everybody's close. I'm going toward one of the houses - is it my house? I think I'm just staying here on a visit. Between me and the house is a strange being - a girl with fur. I'm not thinking of her as a ""cat-girl"", but that is the sort of fur - I don't really know if she has a tail or not. (I may have thought it up after I woke up.) She's also very friendly, and we like each other a lot, though for a moment when we came together I was apprehensive. We talk a bit - I don't remember the conversation, but it's something to do with the reason I'm here, which is a wedding or something. In any case, someone is in transition. We go to another house where there's a gathering of people for this event - we seem to be helping pack up to move out of the house. There's an atmosphere rather like Christmas here, with people and things about. (The girl with fur has now changed to regular skin - she has dark, short hair, kind of pretty, lively, we are friends.) We are in one room - the living room, I guess, and I go into the next room, which is darker, and there's a group of things on the floor to deal with - I think some of them are presents, and there's wrappings about. Interesting stuff, and I believe there's wine bottles."
"76"	"(4/3/86)"	"I am very hot in the living room of the house I live in with my parents, who've gone out. Things were all right before but now I'm very hot, and when they call on the phone to check on me I tell them I'm okay - maybe a little warm. I get up at last to check the thermostat, which I can't see very well. I think it says it's been turned up way high and it's over 80 in here, and I turn it down. Then I look at the thermometer and see it's not that hot, so I turn on the light properly and see I've turned it down to 30 or so. I turn it back and now I have to seriously consider that I have a fever. I notice there are leaks in the roof, and I have to put the bathroom wastebasket under one, only to discover others, and I have to locate other wastebaskets. There's only a couple empty and I have to transfer the..."
"77"	"(4/3/86)"	"I'm out someplace on an errand - the setting is very pretty, lush green, nice building, don't know what it is. Or what I'm doing there. I'm leaving shortly and having to decide about going to La Madeleine for bread or sweets or something, but it's a drawback because it's farther away from my place even than I am now. I consider doing without but then I remember another rustic little French cafe/deli more nearly on the way and I resolve to go there. It's not a place I've been to much but I think it will have what I want, and it's pretty cute."
"78"	"(4/4/86)"	"Me and 2 or 3 other women move into a neat apartment with a pool. It's more like a resort really - I almost think all the places have a pool but they're together sort of. One of my roommates is a shrink and one of the others is her patient - either that or she works with everybody at times. It's a glorious sunny day and we're having a good time - at our pool we have a 2nd, shallow pool - not a hot tub or spa, I don't know what it's for - but it has faucets for hot and cold. There are things in it - something edible that belongs to one of the other women. There's also soap powder in it, because it was there before we ran the water in. I'm trying to get as much of the soap out as I can. There's a guy here too - I think he's the other woman's boyfriend. Seems to be helping me. Somewhere before, there's been something about meat, and things in it - I don't know where it takes place or who's talking, but the topic of discussion is how we used to eat contaminated meat and now what we eat is very clean because of refrigeration. There were close-ups of bugs depositing little black things in pieces of beef. And the point is that if we ever have to do without our refrigerators and freezers we'll have to go back to eating meat with things in it - which may not kill us but we'll have to learn some new things and be careful about it. Meanwhile, back at the pool, I'm playing my radio and also my male cousin comes over to work with one of his patients, who lives in the complex. (A male.) They're on the opposite side of this arrangement, which is partly enclosed - sort of like a marina. He doesn't see me. My 2 roommates are doing some work on the other end of the shallow pool - I'm still doing something with a small bucket. We drain the water out and fill it up again with hot, and it makes bubbles - they have something to do with the work they're doing. I wonder if it isn't going to be too hot, but they don't get in it anyway. I do have to modify it with a bit of cold, though. They want it so the bubbles pile up very big, and literally block off (but not cover up) the girl. I don't know what that's all about. I look over atmy male cousin and he's doing something similar. I decide to go back inside. It requires some odd configuration of keys. Sandy Bourghs is there visiting, and she tells me about going out in the country to pick berries (or something), which sounds like fun. We have a pleasant conversation and [she] leaves. I love this house/apartment. It's got interesting arrangements, and dark wood and molding and a whole lot of character. I stay in here for a while with my radio and then decide I'll go back out for a swim. I don't have a bathing suit, though, so I'll have to wear my shorts and a T-shirt - I think about whether that will be allowed and decide it will. I picture me sitting with some other people in this and it's close enough. I also think I look kind of cute in it. I look around for something to put on my feet and decide I need a pair of rubber thongs - I think someone else is here and we find this very progressive, that here I am wearing shorts and a T-shirt and I would wear beach thongs too. Anyway I start out the side door and look outside, find I've forgotten my radio and go back for it. I see I've blithely left the door unlocked and feel guilty and vulnerable. I get my radio (the casing has come off the transformer that's attached to it) and go out the front door this time - as I'm locking it my male cousin and his patient and his wife come up the walk to go to the street and leave. I think how funny I can actually let my male cousin see me looking like this. I must be getting better. However, he doesn't stop and talk - I don't actually know if he even sees me - but it doesn't bother me anyway."
"79"	"(4/16/86)"	"There's a group of Puerto Ricans or some such holed up in a seedy apartment (do I live in this building too?) who've got up in arms about something - it may be a rent strike or something, anyway their utilities have been cut off. They're rather hostile and I don't want to hang around but at first they won't let me leave. Later I'm outside (but don't know how I got there), and I'm looking at the water spouts on the roof (I guess) and seeing how they fixed up to get water in by hooking up a pipe to a drainspout - the water's dirty but it does come in and I guess they boil it. I sort of admire their ingenuity."
"80"	"(4/9/86)"	"I'm coming to a bus stop on foot - it's at the end of a residential street that turns a circle behind some shops. It seems to be night but it may be the back-alley-like darkness of the place. I stand for a minute at one stop, then decide to change to the other side in case this one doesn't actually go downtown after all. The other side isn't exactly opposite. But rather than stand there I move to the next where there's some cars or something I can obscure myself behind, because there's a group of unsavory types coming this way. I get on the bus and it's not ded but there's plenty of people, including Roger C. It's definitely morning now, and he's being gregarious as usual, talking all the time. He's talking to me now, and I'm conscious of having been given substance and identification in the eyes of the other people on the bus because he knows me, and they know him. He's talking about a couple we know having finally gotten married, which I'm skeptical about and don't find entertaining. This is remarked on, and I reply that I have my doubts about the whole thing and will reserve judgement till I see it for myself. Roger has to get off the bus sooner than I do, and when he leaves I look around for a seat. This is a very different bus, and is furnished with bits and pieces of furniture; it's also L-shaped. The place nearest to me to sit is a very uncomfortable-looking vanity-type chair, square seat, no back to speak of, minimal padding. It's next to a quaint little side table, and the both are backed up to a recliner-lounge chair, rendering it unusable. But I can't effectively move them. (I sit on the little chair for a minute and stand up again?) Then I'm looking through a sort of pad of paper, long and narrow, joined at the top, which may be a calendar or something in its real purpose, but it has also some pictures inserted, as it were for advertising. It came that way. The pictures are of people's faces, who have horrible, catastrophic, disfiguring illnesses, and they're there to direct attention, public attention, to the need for help and understanding. People have looked upon these people as if they were monsters, imagining they were vampires, etc., and I'm aware that if the people near me on this bus were to see them, they'd do that too, and I'm not anxious to discuss it with them."
"81"	"(4/11/86)"	"I'm with Andy, a male friend at a shopping center, very large parking lot, don't know about the place. (Sears?) is relatively small, as we walk toward it I can see inside it's not laid out very attractively but as I look I think it's probably quite normally stocked once you get in there. We're entering by a back entrance, where linens are; we go forward and I come around a main section from the left and back to the right side and look at sunglasses. I kneel down to look at some sunglasses in a basket on a very low shelf - some are children's, the others are so off that they tilt at an almost steep enough angle to spring right off my head. No good. The guy I'm with is looking at something else and I go to catch up with him and we leave. On the way I'm stopped by a guy in a white suit who asks me some questions - just friendly, but I thought rather pushy of him. I think he's asking what I like to do. I get away from him but there's another in the parking lot and I observe there's several, I realize they're Krishnas in a new costume and remark upon the same. I'm thinking they seem less objectionable this way. In the parking lot there's some things going on, like demonstrations of crafts, contests, maybe. I'm not sure if Paula Smith's around somewhere, but I know Sherry is. She's guiding or running something by some nice shady trees and I go to have a look. (I'm not sure what's going on, but it involves a mechanism of some kind.) Sherry is very happy to see me, and gives me some kind of support or advice. Later I'm with Andy (for sure), and he's being his usual boisterous self, sitting at a desk (in his house?) and making passes at me. I don't know how he fits in with the other place but I think he does. A movie theater, quite informal sort of place, maybe it's in somebody's house. I'm sitting (with Andy?) on the side of the audience, we're talking and not really watching the movie, which is some kind of kid-adventure affair. I get interested and get up to change my seat so I can see properly - I go to the back of the little group of seats to have a look for a good place. The guy from the bus is in one seat, so I want to be sure not to sit too close to him. Connected with this is Michael J. Fox, much younger than he is now. Perhaps he's in the movie. I see him as though I'm watching him, but this is all tied up with another scene, the dining room of a house - it's a bit dark - the family that lives here is a bit old-fashioned, and the stodgy old parents don't approve of something. I'm visiting with their son. They're dressed a lot like working-class drudges, and act that way, a bit on the dumb side."
"82"	"(4/13/86)"	"I'm walking with several other people, one of whom is Bobbie. Both of us are having trouble walking, and we've fallen behind the others, but I'm ahead of her for some reason. I seem to be infirm in some way, maybe I'm limping. Bobbie, I think, is okay, but just not as spry as she used to be. The others have to wait for us sometimes, but mostly they let us straggle. We're going to turn right the way the bus does, and I think we're making for town. Later I'm in an office building, walking to an insurance agent's or lawyer's office with another person, maybe 2. Don't know what for. On the way, a woman passes carrying a small child with a spray can of the ""string"" stuff, and it aims it at me. First it doesn't actually spray anything straight, but I flinch and react with fear. It does it again, a bit more this time, and I'm really pissed off. Mama takes offense, grabs the can herself and sprays it right at me, finally getting rather more on me and she frankly enjoys it, seeing somebody messed up who objects to her child's playing. I decide I've had enough and I'm going to put a stop to it, so I grab the can from her, wrench the spray top off and throw it away. She really gets pissed now, and warns me to expect a lawsuit. Don't remember her exact words, but she's quite sure I'm going to get taken to the cleaners. I compose myself and continue to the place we're going, knowing I'll have to clean myself up for the appointment. I wonder how bad the damage is. After we get to the office and check in with the receptionist, we sit on a couch to wait. I get a look at myself in a mirror finally and somehow I've got a black smudge on my forehead and a spot of white, as well as the pink stuff in my hair. I'm thinking now I might as well leave it and let the legal types see how I look. In all this, I'm concerned about her threat to get me in trouble, but not sure what to expect - I don't feel I'm entirely blameless (of course) but positive that she's the one who did the hostile act, and would be the one to get punished, if there was any question of that. I hadn't considered that, of course, I don't think in terms of me calling for retribution. But I'm worried that she's going to get me in trouble - if not directly, then she's going to mess up what I'm doing here at this office."
"83"	"(4/14/86)"	"I have trapped a guy who means to do me some harm in a tiny room and slugged him unconscious - first I sprayed or waved something in his face. This room is odd, and nearly circular, and seems to be independent. It may stand by itself in a house; I don't think it's outside. He and a partner have accosted me and someone else, and he brought me inside to look for something he wants. Now that I've stopped him, I'm thinking of how to get his companion... While I've got a moment, I'm dabbing on some perfume from a little dressing table and looking around. The room is stuffed full of clothes and stuff, old furnishings, but it's tiny... Maybe I should tie him up instead - might come to, then I'd be back where I started. I find a tie and tie his hands. While I'm doing this he starts to come around so I slug him again. I'm enjoying that. I haven't tied anyone up before, so I'm not doing a very efficient job. Especially, I tie his feet and mean to tie his hands to them but they ought to be in back. He's a bit conscious now, and I ask him how flexible he is, can he put his feet through his hands and come up that way? He doesn't think so. There are people around by this time, we seem to have relocated to a street corner or somewhere. I'm conscious that they may thinking I'm the bad guy here and they ought to do something about me."
"84"	"(4/15/86)"	"Kirk driving me and another girl - decide to get something to eat, go to a place where there's a big pistachio cake we drool over in the window, as well as a German chocolate, and then some others. A hotel where I take an elevator to a floor I'm not familiar with and see a girl with long blonde hair who recognizes me and looks familiar to me - but we don't know where we know each other from. She appears at first to have a sort of film over her face. There's a banquet going on somewhere and I'm looking for another exit - the back way is where they've kept the rolls and I mean to steal one. I don't grab when it's easiest but when I'm already out in the hall and may be seen by the serving women. I put it on the plate of food I now have in my hand, hoping it won't be noticed. Someone is collecting money in strange boxes which it is thought are hard to figure out how to get into, but which aren't. They have a sliding top, that's all, and are of wood painted white. The money is for a good cause, and we're on a street sidewalk where the overseer of this showing me how it works. Dirk picks me up from there."
"85"	"(4/18/86)"	"I'm driving to my male cousin's for my appointment - I'm with somebody else and I'm late for some reason. When I get there finally he's rather perturbed because he's got a group together and they're wanting to go someplace for breakfast and work there. I didn't even know about the group - he's arranged this because he's going out of town and is taking care of everybody at once. His house is interesting, with a kind of close front door and entry going back to a kitchen/dining area and the group is in a room left of that. Kitchen light is yellow. They've all had to wait, not just for me, but 1 or 2 others, and now we all get up and leave for someplace, maybe Denny's. I get back in the car - it's either raining or been raining and this is an old convertible, maybe a sports car, top up. I have to take my male cousin's dog with me - it's maybe a Basset Hound and typically morose-looking, willing to be shunted round but not enthusiastic. We leave. On the way I decide, hell, I'm not hungry, and this doesn't sound that great, I'm not gonna go. So I just take off on my own path."
"86"	"(4/18/86)"	"I'm at the library doing something about furniture in a reading room that bears no resemblance to anything in the new or old buildings - it's a very quiet, isolated room with big windows (or a window-wall) that look out over a lot of blue sky and a clean, green landscape with white buildings. The room is in shade. There's a magazine rack to be moved or sold, the furniture has been changed somewhat in function. I look around and find the magazines are now just arranged on top of a cabinet, in the old-style red-edged holders. There's not a lot of furniture here at all, and I don't actually see any tables for reading, or anything much in the way of people using the room, but I know it's a reading room like the old one, for magazines and newspapers. I think it has a parquet floor. I'm leaving, and Lisa is with me. We're going to get something to eat together, and she's driving. We're going into an old neighborhood and it's dark and the feel of the place is that I've gone back in time to Grandmom's neighborhood. Lisa says something, responding to me, that is very typically Pleasing-type, and I react amused, and comment on it. She doesn't know about this, so I explain a bit and also make clear that there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that it's so recognizable. [What she said was in response to me expressing some kind of discomfort and she offered ways to help, but I don't know what it was that I'd said.] We get where we're going, which is a kind of drug/grocery store, small, old-timey, and I live there, or at least I keep my groceries there. I have an ice chest and something else and I'm looking at a couple of large chocolate cakes, sheet size, with chocolate frosting and nuts on top, they're probably more ie than cake. I don't remember how I got them, but I wonder what I can do with them besides eat them all at once like a glutton. I have an inspiration: I'll keep them and have them at a party! No, 2 parties! Considering how big they are, they'll do very well - even cut in half they'll serve a lot of people. I can freeze them until then. I'll cut them in half, and they'll fit in the ice chest better since they're a little too big the way they are. I open the lid and see that the ice is mostly melted. Oh dear, I can't put cake in there. Even wrapped up the best possible way, it won't prevent it from getting soaked eventually. I'll have to think of something else. Meanwhile I notice that my space is being a bit further limited by the produce/cold case that's been shoved further forward and now forms a part of my area = I remark to Lisa that what's in it isn't mine after all, but the store people probably just didn't think how awkward that is."
"87"	"(4/19/86)"	"I'm supposed to go to a city on a plane - I'm running behind all the way. I live in a small frame house on a quiet little street in a neighborhood near the airport, with my stepmother and Dad and I supposemy brother - everybody's going out but Dad, and while I'm packing they all leave. (There was some question about whether Dad would leave too, and I think someone reminds him to lock the door.) I throw things in the suitcase and run on out to the bus stop. The bus stop is only a block or so away. It's dusk, getting later, and I get on a bus after a fidgety wait, and realize it's the wrong one. (I think; not sure about this point.) Also, I've opened the suitcase to refold something and found that I've forgotten very important things like a sweater or something to keep warm with, and I know I have to go back. I've got only half an hour, which is pretty desperate. I know I'll have to drive my car instead of taking the bus. Hadn't wanted to do that because I didn't want to pay to leave it at the airport, but maybe Dad can drive it back and I'll just have to trust him. (I hadn't before.) I know I've got to get off this bus right away, before I get too far to get home, so I throw stuff back in the suitcase and run to the front to stop the driver. Somehow I run back home (even though the case is heavy - perhaps I don't even have it). I go around to the back door first, hoping that either Dad's home or he's left it unlocked. (There seems to be something right in front of the door, which at first I thought was propping it open, but the door is shut.) It is unlocked - I turn the knob and go in, and he's on the couch in the living room watching TV. I run to get clothes, including a nightgown and slippers, and when I open the suitcase, I wonder about the typewriter that's in there. [This is my ex's old typewriter.] I don't really remember putting it there, and I don't think I really need it - after another moment or two I decide to take it out - it's heavy and I can get along much better without it. I check the time and find I've now got 20 minutes (or is it 10?). Things are getting pretty hairy. I am looking at a purple sweater or jacket that I wear with a T-shirt or something else short-sleeved, and find that I haven't got that because my brother's wearing it, which I don't appreciate. How inconsiderate of him to wear my shirt when I want it. Dadand I do get in the car and go on to the airport, but I don't know if I get there in time."
"88"	"(4/28/86)"	"I'm waiting in a line for a haircut. This is in a department store, methinks, and it's not a proper salon, but perhaps the haircutter is visiting or something, he's set up by some partitions, just one chair, and there's a steady stream of people to get their hair cut. The guy behind me is quite chatty - young new-wave type, he's talking about hair and hairstyles, the hairdresser, etc. I'm rather quiet - I'm becoming concerned that I'm getting my hair cut here instead of letting Loretta do it. Is she going to feel insulted? Is this disloyal of me? Maybe I should bug out and call Loretta after all. However, I'm already here and I really do want my hair cut, so why not go ahead? She probably won't mind, after all. And it's something different to do. I get up to almost the head of the line and I get instructions to go to the ladies' room and wash my hair. It's a biggish place, all tile, of course, maybe red or terracotta, all clean and bright. I shampoo my hair and rinse, but not very long, and when I go to the mirror and run my brush through my hair, it gets all soapy again and I go ""yuck"" and have to rinse again. For some reason, even though this counter/sink/mirror arrangement is a narrow spot, it's the same opposite, and my next move is to turn around to the other mirror to finish whatever I'm doing (drying my hair?). Back at the ranch, I join up with the kid again and he's got the idea he can cut my hair himself. He's got style, he says, and he's creative, why not let him try his hand? I figure he can't do all that much damage before my turn comes; so I go along with it. I don't actually seem to remember him cutting my hair clearly, but he does a lousy job, with clumsy chunks out of it. I know it looks dumb but I'll just wait for the pro to recut it. It's just about my turn now."
"89"	"(5/2/86)"	"Bobbie is working at a kind of carrel, imagine a bigger micro reader or charge machine, where it comes over your head. What she's doing involves cards, or something to move about, and I'm coming in from the next room, expecting to do something else, but I can see I really should be helping her. At least, I have the impression that she expects me to, or at least wishes I would but that isn't said. I don't want to, and I'm wondering if I can get away without it. There's an identical carrel behind her, and I start to do something at it. Bobbie goes out for a minute."
"90"	"(5/2/86)"	"I've just come into a room, from outside, with a male companion; this is a place I've been living with my ex, who is also present, and I've recently broken up with him. I'm here to pack up some things I haven't moved out yet, and my ex is really upset about the whole thing. He doesn't start an argument or say anything really inflammatory, but he's seething, as though his pride is hurt and I've done him a great injustice. The other guy is fairly nonchalant - he didn't contribute to any of this, and we're not any big romance, but he is my friend and cares about me - just the same, he isn't anxious to antagonize my ex. As I face away from them (I think I'm sitting at a table or dressing-table), a yellow kitten comes round from behind something to greet me. I'm happy to see him - my ex and I had just gotten him before the breakup and I'd decided he should stay with my ex because I couldn't have all the cats and my ex would need him - but he's adorable and I'm sorry I can't have everything. The kitten's name may be Schroeder. [While I'm dreaming, I try to think of it but S. doesn't seem exactly right and nothing else comes clear.] The kitten is also happy to see me and wants to go with me, but I think (reluctantly) that it's all better this way, we must do what's best. (And I wouldn't want to take him away from my ex.)"
"91"	"(5/10/86)"	"I'm in my apartment bedroom, with someone else (female, don't know who), while a delivery is being made somewhere and there's a truck parked outside my window. It's so big that I'm seeing the underpinnings of it or something - but it's bright daylight and the truck doesn't block the sun. My room is larger and arranged strangely, with (beds?) across the width of it, and somehow making it difficult to get to the window. The other person is standing at the window and calls to me that the kittens have gotten out the window and into the truck - that is, part of the metal stuff of the truck makes a hole that they jumped into from the windowsill. There are 3 kittens, they seem to be MB's, at least one is black and white too, the others aren't the same - one may be and white but I'm not sure. I think the other's all black. They all have names but I couldn't recall them when I was thinking about them, except one's called Trouble, I think. I'm quite upset about them getting on the truck, it might leave and they'd get hurt, or they'd fall to the ground where they are. I tell my companion to get them back and I make my way over there myself. She's got one back in already and then another and the black one falls down. Which doesn't put me in a complete panic but I'm into Emergency mode and I know I have to go get it at once, which is not all that simple under the circumstances, with the furniture in the room. (There also seems to be an opening in the floor, which makes it necessary to climb over the furniture.) I'm also terrified that MB got on the truck too and either fell down herself or will, and she'll be harder to retrieve - but as I get to the door of the bedroom, I see she's here after all. I also don't know how we're going to keep them from doing this again. [Shutting the window didn't occur to me.] (By the way, the distance to the ground looks longer than it really does and the kitten could really have gotten hurt, but I looked down and there were things down there to land on and I didn't think it would be desperate.)"
"92"	"(5/10/86)"	"Previously: I'm on a little balcony or outside upstairs walkway, and there's a place that I'm assuming is some kind of shop. There are things to look at, anyway, and it's all old-timey, maybe antiques, with lace doilies on things. I'm looking through a basket of picture-cards, like big postcards, and come upon one that shows a woman (all dressed quite properly for 1890 or so) on a funny kind of exercise bike, that is built on a nice upholstered chair. It certainly is quaint and funny-looking but as I think about it I think you could actually do that after all. I set it down again and mention to the woman I'm with what I saw, that she'd be interested, she ought to have a look at it. (I don't know who she is, but she's older than me; also standing on a higher level of the floor here, a step or two up from my part of the shop, and by a railing that divides the sections.) She says oh really, where is it, and I go to fetch it again and it isn't there. After an initial look where I knew it ought to be I go through them all again and never do find it."
"93"	"(5/21/86)"	"I'm walking down a road that curves to the left, near a park - it's open where I am, then a hedge-wall on the left (or isn't it growing up a short underpass?), then the park - there's a car coming - I think I know who's in it, but in any case I'm friendly to them, and mean to get out of the way. Rather than moving to the side, I walk faster - the car is moving slowly - and then I find I'd like to run. I'm wearing a skirt and wedge-heel sandals (like my old navy ones) and I thought I wouldn't be able to run in them, but I can, and I run round the curve to the park. There are a lot of people here, and they're putting on a play. However, the play isn't on a stage, it's in the park itself. Most of these people are acting in it, and they're scattered across the sidewalk and onto the lawn. I can't tell exactly what's supposed to be going on, but it's obviously an outdoor scene meant to look colorful. Reminds me of a couple of production numbers in ""Oliver!"" The players are dressed in some (fairly stylized) period costume of that sort (the ""Oliver!"" sort). I am more or less in their way as I go through them - I have to bob and weave a bit - but nobody gives any suggestion that it bothers them and no attempt is made to stop me. Since it's a public park, I think they must expect it. After I get through them I go on up a little grassy hill to meet my ""boyfriend"". He's sitting in the driver's seat of his car, parked up there, near an RV. I go up to the back of the RV. He's waiting for me, we're going to go somewhere else in his car, but I have to do something first. I have an object in my hand (I must have gotten it from the back of the RV, I haven't had it before) - it's a circle, tubular, orange, and probably plastic, maybe 8"" in diameter, and it has a clasp or join of some kind, like a necklace would - the thing is twisted open and I'm trying to bring it back together and hook it in place."
"94"	"(5/22/86)"	"I'm in a grocery store, towards the back, and I'm looking at things on shelves that make a corner, where I can't be readily seen. Nobody passes by much. As I'm standing I shit. I feel it, and the natural urge to void, then I realize what I'm doing. I'm startled and horrified and turn with my back to the shelves and try to shake it off. Won't go. A person or 2 walks by and doesn't notice, and I finally realize I'm wearing a skirt and underpants. (I'd thought I had nothing on from the waist down at least.) This means it's not just one long turd hanging off, though, it's mashed in my pants. Yuck. But at least I can go to the bathroom. When I get there, there's a line. Theo is in it. I'm not very happy about having to wait."
"95"	"(5/22/86)"	"I've just come back to the ""library"" from being out somewhere and Bobbie wants me to fix up some displays on tables. She points out others and asks if I didn't do some of those. I said I had, sort of -I just fixed them up a bit. I wish she wouldn't ask me to do things like that. The room looks rather like an exhibit hall. The displays seem to be ceramic or porcelain - plates and bowls and colorful objects."
"96"	"(5/22/86)"	"I'm in a small plain room with a high ceiling and long tables going across. We're supposed to be looking at a film. It's the next place I went in the ""library"" and I'm on the staff here, the others are patrons. The person who set this up has to leave and asks me to take over. Again I'm not thrilled about this and say to the 3 or 4 others that I've never done this before. I also drop my stuff on the floor. (Books, notebook, etc.) While the film is going on (I guess) a troop of people, mostly kids, come through the door and into the next room (to their right - an open passage - room is dark - another door opposite - looks a bit lab-like). Dana's with them, and I go talk to her. I notice one, then another, then another, of these kids look like younger versions of people I know and I realize they must be the offspring (I'm only aware of boys, though) of those people. I'm taken aback and say to myself the time has passed and I didn't even know it - that my friends could all have kids this big. I say this to Dana and she agrees. She's trying to keep them all organized for a tour and periodically gives instructions - they go across and out the other door. They all get through and the lot leaves. I go back to the other room."
"97"	"(5/22/86)"	"I'm in a strange sort of car with a guy (can't place him) - I'm not aware of either of us driving but we are moving. It's begun to rain cats and dogs, and I think how clever it would be to wash the car now. I guess we go under things from time to time, and I try to get the soap on the car (by hoisting meself partly through the back window) before we come back out into the rain. Doesn't work, but it's fun."
"98"	"(5/25/86)"	"I've been kidnapped - held prisoner in a little frame house by a group of men, all typical bad-guy types, led by a smallish guy with dark hair and eyes and several days' growth of beard, and a big mustache. Looks like he's trying to be a Pancho Villa, sort of. They're not holding me for ransom, I don't think - it's a power trip and I'm being threatened with rape, though nothing's happened yet. I get moved from one room to another some, I'm not stuck in one place. I feel tense and dreadful, but not terrified. There are always hints and innuendoes about what can happen to me and mostly I just stay quiet and don't disturb anything in case I might draw attention to myself. Lori and Tom are here somewhere, but I don't know why. I think they're prisoners too but I'm not sure about their status. At least they don't seem to be getting the same treatment that I do, except that once the little nasty guy had Tom do some things with me. It was kind of like dancing and kind of like feeling me up but didn't go very far. At first I didn't know it wasTom and when I found out I was kind of relieved.Tom was kind of nervous and spooked, keeping quiet like me. At last they've left me alone again and I can look around - I find a way out and I can get outside when the guards aren't looking and run away. I check to see if their attention is elsewhere and take off. I don't have to run far to be able to ""disappear"" - the house is in an open, urban district, actually quite near a big industrial ""yard"" of some sort, and I suppose a factory or some such thing - I can see downtown rising across the space it's a little overcast today but no rain., There are also a few other buildings round here, like office buildings, and right here in the street (I guess) is a little art/crafts fair, with tables and displays of various pretty things. This is just far enough from the kidnappers' house I think I can keep out of sight here. (Actually I'm not even sure they know I'm gone - there's no hue and cry so far, but I'd better keep moving.) I feel quite light and cheerful, actually - this is fun. I look around some and then move on - I go into an office building nearby. It's small for an office building and has 8 floors. I believe I'll go up to 8 - I have the idea I'll be safer there and somehow I can run up there. The elevator door is right next to the building's commissary/deli - there are deli cases in a horseshoe around this smallish room, with only a few tables. The light's very dim here, except for the lights in the cases., There are several people here, waiting for the elevator, which is dead slow. While I'm waiting I go and look in the cases at the goodies, which are rather tempting, but I don't get anything. (Am I not hungry? Or don't I have any money?) The ladies in the white food-service-y uniforms behind the counters sort of lean on them casually like they're a little bored, but comfortable and remark that this elevator's always like that, isn't it awful? When I came in I pushed the button for the 8th floor (from the outside, yes) and it wouldn't light up. So I pushed some more, and harder, and eventually the button just caved in on itself and the inside showed the mechanism gone. You just can't go to the 8th floor at all. So finally the elevator shows up and the 5 or 6 of us get on, and by George the button for 8 is already pushed in here. I'm a bit frustrated, since I really wanted to go to 8. I guess I'll go to 7, but I'm not sure I know what's there and maybe it won't be as much fun."
"99"	"(5/30/86)"	"A large rather horseshoe-shaped house - name ""hacienda"" comes to mind - I think it has red tile roofs, some parts are 2-story. A large group of people are staying here - house is neither my house nor a hotel, or an apartment building as far as I can tell, it may be an institution of some kind, like a school. The people here are more or less homogeneous - mostly my age, equal men and women - all engaged in something, which I think is putting on some kind of production. We operate together, but there's a lot of us and we have smaller groups for various tasks. [The house is old but not antique-y like some of my others. Lots of greenery around, reinforces the Mexican look of the place - or Southwestern, anyway. Whatever it is, it's a well-established one, comfortable and well-suited.] I'm in a back hallway, darkish, the only light comes from a window in the outside door at the end and a light on the telephone ""booth"" - one of those wall-things. Somebody who reminds me of Nan is using the phone. I wait for her and someone comes by us. For some reason I'm concerned, don't know why. Goes on down the hall. ""She"" finishes her call and we go down the hall ourselves and out and around to a gathering of people in a large, bright room with a lot of long tables in, I suppose, it's a dining hall. I don't see any food but maybe we're just finishing a meal. Anyway, we're all talking amongst ourselves and the guy who walked down the hall comes in and starts to berate me. It's all a lot of nonsense, he's really quite wrong, but he's really wild and seems to be coming unglued. Somebody (I think the guy next to me) faces him about it and he says (to wit) ""Aha! You think I can't/won't do anything about this! We'll see about that!"" And he brings out a large cobra. Everybody gasps and pulls back and he threatens with it like a madman and runs it over his fingers and all. I seem to be the most panic-stricken and I run, after I stare at it mesmerized for a minute, looking to see if it really is a cobra and if it isn't maybe this isn't so bad, but I think it is and this is big-time serious. I run out of the place and he follows. I run across the courtyard to a set of stairs and a little bitty sub-courtyard/patio and ask if they'll hide me. [Apparently not - I know I am back in that hallway again. May have been before the stairs or not. I do spend rather a while running from this guy. I am really afraid of that snake - they are really poisonous."
"100"	"(5/30/86)"	"I'm driving a car somewhere, because it's south of downtown like that other dream, there's a big space to cross from here to downtown, with open industrial things going on between. I've stopped at a little building that seems to front some grounds and may be, like, the cafe attached to a motel or a park or something. I get out and go around back for some reason - there are people around, some going along a pathway that gets you to the grounds, others hanging around socializing. I'm not terribly anxious to be noticed, whatever it is that I'm doing (I'm looking for something, or a way to do something, but I have to poke around to do that), so I give it a miss and go back to the car. I'm thinking it might be more practical and fun to go from this point on a bicycle, though I'm not sure how practical it is. I get the bike out of the car and try it out. It's really very nice, a very nice day for riding and a nice bit of path. But I think to myself, how am I going to bring the car along too? Actually I think I can do it easily enough, it'll just be awkward and slow me down and I'm rather in a hurry. But I can't leave it behind."
"101"	"(5/31/86)"	"I'm around a bunch of people working together, in a sort of cabin-like place. We're working at tables across the room (or they are, anyway, I think I came from outside). A few of these are my particular companions - a couple of men, one of whom is leader, and at least one woman. We all know the others though. One of the guys I'm with has a new rifle of some sort, with a fancy sight on it. And it fires silently. He wants to test it out, so he (standing next to me) shoots this other woman (part of our group). It's claimed to be an accident or is somehow presented as acceptable, and they cart her off next door. Nobody is particularly upset but there's some concern in the air. I'm rather impressed and the guy asks if I want to fire it. I do, but I'm not anxious to kill anybody, even though I know if I don't I won't know whether or not it really works so well, or if I could use it ""when the time came"" - like there's some future likelihood of having to shoot somebody. So I take it and we decide I'll shoot our group leader (who looks like James Caan), standing across the room among some other people. There's a woman next to him. I raise the rifle and try to sight. The thing makes a kind of beam that pinpoints exactly where to shoot, and I have to wave it around till I can steady it on the guy's forehead. Not that easy to do and I'm afraid he'll see me. I lower the gun and speak to the first guy again (he's nobody particular except maybe the guy from yoga class - not a boy, dark hair, mustache, stocky), then raise the gun again, try to sight, and the leader isn't there anymore. I'm shocked, have the sudden realization he's seen me, and is standing right next to me, and I lower the gun and there he is. Ook. He takes the gun away, says something to the people in the room, like ""did you all see this?"", and they say or mumble things like ""not me, I was looking the other way"", and steadfastly return to their business. I'm aware that this isn't a kosher incident any way you look at it, but I'm only on notice, nobody gets in trouble for these things."
"102"	"(5/31/86)"	"I'm in a house - I don't think it's mine - the others are out somewhere and there's a map here that's very important - belongs to someone who's out. 2 or 3 people, including a young blonde girl, come to the house - they're not visitors, exactly, maybe they present themselves as having business, but they steal the map - the others come back and find them outside nearby and challenge them on it. They're defiant, claiming they didn't steal it they had this one all along. [Mostly I'm feeling girlish and helpless through all of this and the last dream, too.]"
"103"	"(6/7/86)"	"I'm out someplace pretty far from home and I want to get back, but have no car. There aren't any buses out here (at least not on a weekend) and I don't really know what I'm going to do. I'm certainly not going to hitchhike - I'm not sure if anybody I can call could come get me. There's a tour bus here, and people are coming up to it. Eavesdropping a bit, I learn that it's a natural-history sort of affair. It has pretty much only older folks along, but they don't seem to be exclusive, and it doesn't cost much, so I think I'll try to sneak on. I wait for a couple of people to check their places on the list the driver's got, and when I get up to him I'll say I was late registering and didn't get on the list. It works just fine and I get on the bus with the others, we're leaving shortly. The bus is an old yellow schoolbus. Right now I don't know whether or not I'll just disappear when we get there, or offer some excuse why I'm leaving the group (like I phone home and they tell me I'm needed), or maybe I'd even like to stay and see. But I've got to get home. I think I'd prefer to call somebody to come get me because using the buses means waiting a long time, then going downtown to transfer. Or I could walk. A long haul, but maybe I could get to one of my own bus lines. I'm at the entrance to the Faire, or perhaps another, but I want to go there anyway. I'd been planning to go later after going home and changing clothes, but I find myself here anyway. (I'm not sure how - is this where the bus was? Or where the bus stopped? [Or another dream?] ) I'm wearing shorts and have a big shoulder-strap bag and a parcel or 2nd bag with me, not heavy but awkward to carry and I have no place to leave it. I'm hesitating, weighing the possibilities of not going in and seeing it now, when I'm already here, and being burdened with these things and not free to enjoy myself. The entrance is a kind of big tunnel, short, call it more like an underpass - you arrive at it from a residential street (nice place too); on somebody's lawn, quite large, one of those rises off the street but not too high. There are people outside, just hanging around talking, and you can see the Faire through the tunnel. I think I've made up my mind to go ahead and take advantage while I'm here but I get halfway in and decide this is not practical and I can wait long enough to go get more comfortable. I'm fighting a fear that it'll go away if I leave now. I can picture myself inside, looking up at a display (like the earring lady's) - everything looks more like a carnival. I'm in a very large room - gym-size - in an institution, perhaps - and there are lots of people (all more or less my age) who, I think, have to do with LT. There are bathroom-stalls set up inside the room in long rows and it may be morning and everybody has bathroom-stuff to do. Lots of movement. I'm looking for a free stall because I have to use the toilet, and I find one at the end of a row. These have 2 doors, one each side. The other door is open, and there's another girl in here. (These are 2-person stalls, you see: they have sinks and mirrors and so forth, too, actually quite nice), and I ask her to shut the other door. Which she does. That's all."
"104"	"(6/7/86)"	"I'm on a bus with a couple of guys - one's the regular driver, nice neighborly sort of guy, and the other may be my father and I may be a kid. [Hard to say, but my relationship with these people is I'm younger and along for the ride. They're the ones with business to take care of.] This is a small town, I think. Lots of trees. People know each other. Friendly. This bus is a school bus, but it's Saturday and there's no school, so we're going someplace else instead. Involves leisure, but I don't know quite what. I'm sitting up front with the driver, looking at a newspaper propped up on the dashboard. It has an article in it about a kid, a boy maybe 10, with a picture. Dorky looking. The article says the kid did something interesting - or he may be missing. Anyway somebody's a little bit concerned about him. We go through a couple of nice residential streets (I think we started in a little green-surrounded parking lot of a small office or similar building) and we come to a shopping center. It's really cute, with an eclectic design to it, and interesting little shops. It's an outside-oriented place, not a mall, you park in the middle, but today they've got things hanging on string all over the parking area. They're things from the shops, I guess, fun stuff, as a display, but there's rather a lot of them and the driver has to maneuver through them. It's rather tricky and they get thicker the further you go."
"105"	"(6/9/86)"	"I live in a little house a bit like Grandmom's - that style, wood floors and screen doors, not fancy. I've called a TV repairman earlier, to come and fix a TV set, but haven't fixed a time (or a price, I think). I'm just now coming home to find this guy in the middle of my living-room floor, working on another set than the one I asked about. I'm very disturbed about his being there without my knowing about it. I ask him who let him in, but don't get an answer. He seems to think this is all perfectly normal and I'm bothering him. The furniture's mostly gone from the living room and I'm thinking burglary, but he says he moved it because he needed the room. He's worked on several things so far, including things other than TV sets. I'm quite incensed about the whole thing and we go back and forth about it. I point out that I didn't order anything else done and I didn't want it done and won't pay for it. I don't think he has any excuse beyond ""I wasn't told what to fix so I fixed what was broken"", but still I'm worried I'll have to pay, and I'm really anxious to find out how he got in here."
"106"	"(6/11/86)"	"I'm on a bus, going to the dentist, across an open space. I have with me a yellow air tank that I just bought, and I've pulled the ""cap"" off of it by accident and it's bounced over to the other side. I'm going to go find it; a couple of men come in, one older, one younger but not very, and they take my seat. I figure I'll go tell them, at least get my tank back and they can stay there, but I'm putting it off for a minute while I (chat with somebody?)...I see the guy, the younger one, nearest the window, lift up the tank - they're talking about who left it there? and so on, and the guy throws it out the window. He thinks it's abandoned and it's in his way. I'm not positive that's what he's done, so I don't immediately jump on him, but I'm looking out the back window to see it. There's too much in the way. I can't see it yet, but then something yellow bounces into view. I'm extremely perturbed but not sure I want to confront this guy. After a few minutes I decide it's worth it, so I go tell him the tank was mine. He's sort of half-sorry (but only half - he's more amused at me). I tell him I paid $12 and something for it and I'd appreciate being reimbursed. He says he will and starts to reach in his pocket. We're getting near my stop, though, and I'm worried I'll miss it because he's taking so long. I've almost decided I'll have to give it up and get off because I have to make my appointment. But the bus stops, anyway, and we're all off now, in a large waiting room that looks like it used to be a high-school gym. We're all scattered around. I guess it's like a stagecoach rest stop or something, the journey's to continue soon. People are milling around, some in groups. I make my way over to the two men and ask for my money again. While I'm doing that, I'm noticing the door on the far side of the room, it goes to a hallway with offices coming off it, and the first one is my dentist's office. I also see a clock and discover that it's only just turned 7.00, the time of my appointment - I've made it, and I can be a couple of minutes late, he's probably not finished with the last patient. The guy still hasn't given me my money, though, and we're walking across the room toward the door, casually. At one place we stop and talk, but I'm very distracted by the exhibition next to me. A pretty girl with dark curly shoulder-length hair is on her back on the floor and she has clothes on, but her skirt is pulled up high enough to see her abdomen and somebody else is over her pushing on something - with her hands - very hard, hard enough to puff. I can't quite see what she's pushing on, though. It's a lot like CPR but not being done on the heart. There's someone else there, too, doing something, I guess, but maybe just watching. I saw them before, but it seemed then like it must be some form of exercise. Now I can see her face better and also pubic hair and by George I think it's some strange form of sex! I guess the others must not be taking any notice of it - nobody's told them to stop. The clock is now at 7.02, and the dentist and his nurse come out to say goodbye to the previous patient. Later, I'm back in my apartment when there's a knock on the door. It's daylight, so I go to the matchstick blinds and look out to see who's there. I'm pretty sure it's the man from the bus, and he's holding a ""Meerschaum"" pipe up to the window so I can see it. I recognize it and go to let him in - he must have decided he'd buy me a pipe instead of giving me the money. I'd mentioned in conversation that I liked them, but I really don't need one. I think he's a jerk anyway. When I open the door, he asks to come in and I reluctantly let him, but I won't close the door. I push something, a flat box, across the sill with my feet, and mention we have to watch to see the cat doesn't get out."
"107"	"(6/15/86)"	"I've just gotten home from school - I live in this house with my Mom and Dad [not my real ones - a fairly nice pair of sitcom parents, we're loving and close] ; I'm young but not little, and my attitude is light, cheerful; it's a nice day. I open the front door of the house, which is not facing the street but sideways to it; I had to pass between the side of the house and (the garage?) to come to the front door. There's a man inside the door; he's obviously broken in and is waiting to do me harm. I drop my book and run. I run back around to the street, screaming for help. Across the street a woman opens her front door, first a crack, then she comes out - now there's somebody else out, maybe others. I stop and look around; the man's not following me."
"108"	"(6/23/86)"	"I'm looking for a boy - I'm my own age, probably, but he's around 20 - I'm asking a girl about him - she's trying to look him up in the phone book, under Smith, (Bobby?); then I call and ask for him, and he says the name was Williamson, and he recognized me. I'm surprised. Now we're together; I haven't seen him in years, I'm glad to be visiting with him, it's comforting to be back in my old home (town? neighborhood?) for a while. We went to feed his cats in a big old barn - it's dark; (we? I? he?) put(s) the light on. I pet the cat, and a friend of his comes in - she's a big, farm-girl type with long blonde hair and overalls or jeans and a (plaid shirt?). She offers us each a hamburger and brings them in. My friend complains that his hasn't got any trimmings on it; she says she's been working hard and he's lucky to get one. Mine, however, is big and has a lot of stuff on, kind of clumsy, as a matter of fact. She served them in bowls. My feelings are warm, friendly, welcoming, grateful, overall very pleasant attitude."
"109"	"(6/25/86)"	"I'm driving a car, going into town on a road,there's some structure nearby overhead, and this may be a bridge. I'm by myself, got business somewhere, on my way. Not anxious or excited or up or down, just okay all the way around. Daytime, sky's a trifle overcast, weather calm. I'm in a train or bus station (about where Union Station really is) looking at a display of Dad watches. I intend to choose one but haven't decided. They're mostly all alike, large faces, maybe oval, with wide, colorful bands, some bright solids, some flowery patterns and plaids. [They remind me of the new shorts I've got, especially the pink and black flowered ones.] This is not a crucial matter, but I'd like to get it out of the way so I can get on with my business, and I am taking rather longer than I thought to decide. I can't actually see other people from here, though I'm aware there are some around. The display rack is sort of tucked in a corner, this is rather a tired little excuse for a station gift shop."
"110"	"(6/27/86)"	"I'm lying in a large upholstered chair; Tom is nearby, and a female (unidentified). I'm shifting around in the chair and the upholstery tears and the seat sinks. I'm frightened, it's as though I'm going to fall into the chair and (drown? hurt myself?)Tom goes for help."
"111"	"(6/30/86)"	"As part of a trip to England, I'm visiting Pete Townsend, being taken by a man who'll introduce us; this is prearranged. We knock on the bedroom door [this house is kinda long and rangy, certainly not very English, I think it's on some water] and he answers - still asleep, really, very groggy, goes back in. I go to a forward room and look around, and then he comes out waked up and we visit. He's been to my place at home, earlier, when I wasn't there. I tell him about [gardens? ""gardits""? can't read, don't remember] - he'd talked to an older man there, I don't know him. We go around to another room [a living room, I think, with a view] - his wife comes in, we're introduced - I ask her if she went to the Renaissance Faire that they had in London, and she says yes, she quite liked it. I'm glad."
"111a"	"(6/30/86?)"	"#111a (6/30/86?) I'm at a restaurant with Bill Wold and another male - (I'm? we're? they're?) harassed by the waiters about another girl. We all leave; Bill and I are going back to the Center. I'm going on the bus; Bill calls a friend to come pick him up. [We'd been sitting outside at an umbrella table.] The bus is slow and it's cumbersome getting off. Bill isn't here yet. I go to a room at the Center, where there's something that wants protecting. I've gotta wait for Bill and this door won't latch properly. The hook's too high for the loop. I try to keep the door pushed to, but it's too much effort. Bill and his friend nearly bust the latch off getting the door open. Then I'm being chased by a man in a mask, on a residential street. I run, yelling for help - a woman looks out of her door, then steps out, then others do the same. The man turns and leaves. Then I'm in a very strange public restroom with a central/circular configuration of toilet stalls with high- and low-separated partitions - you can see other women's upper bodies. I look at a couple of pairs of very pointy tits, extremely curious."
"112"	"(7/3/86)"	"I'm in an apartment with some LT people - we've been together for a while, been somewhere and come back. This place has a lot of people in it (not this apartment, the whole building) and there's a lot of activity going on outside. It's maybe dusk. There's some sort of commotion outside. I'm near the front door anyway, trying out a key (yet another old key I've been handed - it's got 3 fronts to it, they're all scratched up and bent backwards but I couldn't see that at first). As I look at it I can see it won't work, and I see how soft the metal is and it breaks off and so I do that some more for fun. I'm talking to 2 guys at the same time. The noise outside sort of erupts, I think, and we go look. MB is here, too, and as we look over the wall of the outside walkway (we're upstairs) there's other people ding around. It reminds me of a movie scene of a Mongol camp or something - I might've seen cookfires and tent-tops if I'd looked around. Down below, there's a couple of cops all dressed in motorcycle gear with helmets and goggles, apprehending a couple of bad guys. One of the cops hits a bad guy just because he didn't like the way he looked, I guess, or he said something the cop didn't like. Anyway it was unwarranted. He had the guy by the collar and swung his arm way up and around and hit him in the face. I was appalled. I think he would have beaten up the guy if there hadn't been witnesses. I was feeling very disturbed, and thought I hadn't ever actually seen anything violent happen before. [Though that's not true.] While we're there, MB gets up on the wall rather clumsily, and I'm afraid she'll fall, which she does. I get rather upset at this, even though I know it's unlikely she'll get hurt, because there's so many people and things below. I call out to them to help her out. However, when I look over, I see there's some kind of awning not far down and she's on that, starting to climb back up. It's a struggle but she does it. Oh good. I'm relieved. We all go back in after the cops get ready to take the bad guys away. Inside is, I think, really Sue S.'s apartment, and she likes having company, she likes having movement and people doing things. We come here after a Training, for instance, to do LT tasks/activities and be together. It varies, how many of us, and we come in and go out at intervals. I'm talking to a couple of people, one of whom is a pregnant blonde girl, who got that way because she's going with a guy that I'm in love with, which is rather frustrating for me. It certainly reinforces my self-consciousness. I'm feeling anxious, deprived, small, weak, pitiful. I go down the hall to Sue's room for some reason, can't remember what, but I don't want anybody to see me obviously poking around. I also want to spit, the way I do when I cough something up, and don't want anyone to see that. Someone (large, female, like Sabina) looks in at the door and says something, though, and I have to hold it. Starts to go away, I start to spit, she Dads back, etc. I give up."
"113"	"(7/3/86)"	"I'm in a department store. It's big and probably being remodelled, things are not where they should be and it's very unfinished-looking. They're having a huge sale and I'm aiming at some fur coats they're announcing, 50 only, something like $500. I'm not moving very well, I'm stiff and like it used to be with my legs. I have an ice cream cone or a dish or something, it's chocolate, partially melted. A couple comes up behind me and wants past. I'm in a place where I can't just dodge them, so I go on forward, but they jostle past me anyway. They don't push me over but since I can't get my footing quick enough I fall over, my stuff spills - I had other things to carry, too. I feel anger, suddenly, and outrage, and I want to punish the guy. (It was his voice I heard as they pushed by me, and he certainly didn't care about seeing what happened to me.) I want to push the ice cream into his face. I lie there for a minute, seething, then I get up with difficulty, scoop up some of the ice cream, and go after him. It takes a bit, but I find him, I think. He's sitting somewhere, maybe like at tables, or some seats lined up inside a walled-off area (waist-high, you can lean over it). He's in front of another man and they face the wall. This is maybe in a sporting-goods section. Dead-end part of the store. I'm not 100% certain he's the same guy, but I think he is. Got a beard and short hair - my age or a bit younger, slender. I confront him and the conversation is odd. He obviously doesn't think there's anything wrong and won't answer me, but the guy in back does. At least I think he does. Then I think it's my guy but he's not moving his lips, or I don't see him do it. I'm aware that it might be the wrong guy but by now I'm so worked up I no longer care. I grab him, rub my handful of ice cream in his face and leave. I'm afraid he'll follow me, so I move fast. When I know he can't see me I run a few feet, then slow down and walk, then dodge over an aisle or round something, speed up, slow down. Still aiming for the fur coats. I didn't get one but, leaving, I'm going down Hillcrest with somebody and we stop and visit with a large blonde guy who, when he hears of my infirmity, offers to work on me some. Massage, maybe, or something more exotic, I don't know. Another time I'm at my mother's. I'm putting something back into a container - been out for a while and I thought this was supposed to be cold but it's not now. There are cookie-things lined up in a tray - they look loose but they're stuck together with something, I thought ice cream and it would be melted but it's not, it's marshmallow. I want one but I know it'd show and I expect she's got them counted and it would throw things off."
"114"	"(7/5/86)"	"Lou Ann and June at the office - Judy and somebody have been to a program down the street somewhere on lunch hour and Lou Ann thinks she won't have time but wants to go. I encourage her. Place has a hallway, looks like a newspaper or somewhere you have drafting tables. Then I'm getting a job laying out and painting lines on a parking lot for a little old building - there are men around, I think the ones that hired me, they're not too informative. I meet a guy who invites me to a buffet lunch at a place like a country club. We chat at the table with some other people while they're setting things out. I'm a little confused about his interest in me, and this place, too - is it really something he's treating me for, or could I have come here myself? Can I really eat what I want, or do you snack? This might be a fashion show or something. While we're getting our food, Becky and Lisa show up, they're on their lunch hour from work. Now I know the place has some exclusive overtones at least or Becky wouldn't be here. We say hello and talk about the food. I get a paper plate from a stack - a 2nd choice - and find it's smaller than the other, so I get another one and remark on that. I like this guy I'm with. I hope I see more of him - not sure about his feelings for me though."
"114a"	"(7/11/86)"	"#114a (7/11/86) I've moved into a house - it's a nice little one-story frame house, not so terribly old, like VKian, as to have a style - more like a plain farm house-y look. Cabinets built-in, with screen doors, layers of paint, sturdy, darkish inside right now, late afternoon. I like it a lot. I may or may not have been planning to live with a roommate, but I certainly didn't know a bunch of LT people were going to live here too. They start arriving, and I'm quite concerned about this - I'm feeling deprived and disappointed, but looking at it objectively, maybe it will be fun and productive. However, something dawns on me all of a sudden, and far too late: I'm a long way away from work - this place is some such distance anyway, and I've got to drive to work! No bus! and it's so far! It'll take all morning to get to work. Damn. My mind pictures the road - it's as if this house is out in the country, and the road to town will be 2-lane, no development, most of the way, and I'm thinking maybe it won't be as bad as all that, with no lights and so on. But I'm feeling panicky all the same, not about the drive but about having moved in here without knowing these things and it's too late to back out."
"115"	"(7/12/86)"	"I'm somewhere away from home, driving a (jeep-Bronco-sort-of-thing like Lori's), with a baby - maybe a toddler - for a passenger. We're going somewhere for an outing, just starting, and I'm realizing I have to go back for something. It may be just to put makeup on, because I haven't done that today. We go back to the kid's house - not mine - I'm staying there as a guest, and this outing is in the nature of babysitting. The house is rather suburban ranch-style, one floor, attached garage, rather upscale, yucca plants and stone outside. I pull up next to the garage, and a man either comes out or is waiting and takes the kid inside. He's maybe a friend of the family, or a relative, middle-aged, nice, helpful. I'm sitting in the driver's seat, taking out some toner and a cotton ball - I think I'll try to get my makeup off in the car, dash in and throw a face on - we're actually not so much in a hurry, but we want to make this stop quick and get back on the road. I decide the toner isn't such a great idea and get out of the car. When I open the door, a can (or something - it sounds like a can) falls out and rolls into the open garage. There are large hanging things (the size of meat carcasses, but they're not). I'm concerned about having to dig around in there to find anything, especially if it's just an empty can, but a couple of steps and I see there's not that much on the floor and the can is just a little way under something. I get it and bring it back, and go on into the house. The house is furnished the way the outside looks - rather like Joan's - semi-modern, slightly upscale, open space, clean, glass table tops. The parents of this kid are a youngish couple that match the house - she's got shoulder-length blonde hair and looks nonchalant. They're just sitting down to dinner and they say as long as we're here, why not just stay and eat, then go back out? Sounds pretty sensible to me."
"116"	"(7/19/86)"	"I'm in my apartment, maybe asleep, but I've been in the bedroom a while and I have a funny feeling about someone being in the other room, I'd better check. I picture in my mind some things being gone, like the TV. But I go in and find almost everything gone - the shelves, even, that the TV was on - all wiped out, silently, while I was asleep. I'm sad, at a loss - I feel bereft and don't know what to do. It's as though this was visited on me as a kind of punishment or justice. I walk around a bit but mostly just look at where things have been, thoughts running through my mind, like, I wonder if I'll get the things back - what will I do to replace them - will I be able to replace them - I feel exposed, stripped, violated, taken. I go back into the other room."
"117"	"(7/25/86)"	"I live in a big ritzy hotel in a city. My family and a lot of other people I know live here too. I'm leaving soon for somewhere else and I'm packing, gathering things up, and seeing people. I'm in my parents' place, doing something in the kitchen (it's an apartment setup, with a tiny kitchen separated from the living room by a counter), like mixing up cat food. I transfer something to another container - I don't like the taste of it but I don't have a lot of time, so I'll take it along and deal with it later. I go outside with my father and some other people to put things in the car. There's some reason why this doesn't work out - maybe I've forgotten the keys, or the car's not here. I see several more friends, however, including Don, who comes along back inside with me. Inside there's a lot of different places to go, like any big hotel, and I choose an elevator bank to go upstairs. As we leave the elevator, rounding a corner, we nearly run into Cindy, who's stopped because she's dropping things. (There's a lot of people, bumping elbows.) Before I fall over from running into her, Don puts an arm around my waist and steadies me. I see Cynthia's dropped her watch (a standard-size, round dial, yellow band, design on it) and I exclaim, ""Oh, Cindy, you've dropped your watch - I'll get it"" or something to that effect. So I stoop for it, but it gets kicked away once or twice. Seems very odd to me, as though all sorts of things are being thwarted for no reason. Anyway, we leave her and go on down the hall, which doesn't look right to me. I realize I've taken the 2nd elevator bank again, rather than the 3rd, to get to my place. I exclaim as much, again, frustrated. Don says, ""Oh, well, you'll get there, all you have to do is cut through there"", which is a big open office behind double glass doors. Regular office workers, men in shirtsleeves, wearing ties. I go on through and find the hotel store on the other side. I'm surprised, having forgotten how big a store it was. It's kind of dark, has eclectic things like old-timey decor and a few arcade games. Other side of the store is a restaurant. The operation doesn't have walls. I think briefly that I've never been here, but now that I see it I realize I have too, it's just that I haven't been here in a long time. I thread my way through the little round tables to the open hallway and the next elevator bank. There's a waiter here who asks if he can help me. I'm briefly embarrassed because I'm having a little trouble finding my way through the tables. [By the way, Don went on back to his place down the hall where the office was.] I go on to my place. On the way, I'm aware of something that's mine, that's elsewhere in the building, I'll have to get it."
"118"	"(7/25/86)"	"In my apartment (looks like this one), I'm with the cats (there are 3), and they're having a pretty good time with the packing up. They keep bringing me things, including chain headpieces I'd forgotten about. All of a sudden I look and they've brought something else. The last is a large beaded one I swear I didn't know I had. It's long, and has biggish red and blue beads, very outlandish for that sort of thing but quite impressive. There's a noise; we all look up, but it was short and we ignore it. But a little time passes and now I hear the front door squeaking. It's creaking as though it were open and swinging a bit. [We're in the bedroom, and the door's supposed to be shut, probably latched, but maybe it isn't!] I'm very alarmed, and crawl on my hands and knees silently to the bedroom door to look out. The door's open, all right, and swinging, you see daylight all around. But nobody there, which is a relief. I turn back to the cats, then back to the door, which I mean to get up and close. But now there's somebody standing between me and it - a short, black figure, skinny - maybe a human black child, but with the sun glare behind him it's hard to see. It doesn't really look like a child, and it's definitely hostile. I can't see that it's wearing clothes, either. I'm frightened, knowing it's here to rob, but will attack me now that it knows someone's here. I barely have time to think all this and wonder what to do, before it runs at me through the door. I trip it with my body - after all, I am on the floor, and it goes down headfirst with its legs in the air, which I grab."
"119"	"(8/2/86)"	"The place I am is either the library or a school or both - I both work here and am taking a ""class"" here (I think). I'm supposed to turn in a report of some kind, but I haven't done the work yet - I haven't had time. I need a piece of information, about how long was the average hospital stay of wounded soldiers in WWI (or is it II?), and I haven't found it yet. I'm in a room where I'm meant to be working, and not looking at books, but - as you know - if I see one I want to flip through it, see what it is. The book I've been looking at is open on the table - it's rather kid-oriented, lots of pictures and broken-up page formats, I look over the pages but I still don't see what I want. There's a lot of other books on this table, most of them old, looking like rebinds, I think they're all kid's books. I'm looking at the titles and find one that strikes me fancy, so I set it aside to look at later. [I'm not sure if it's that book or another, but I am looking at one more closely - it has to do with how to live with your family, in various situations - humorous style, like so many kid's books are in order to help get the point across.] I'm a bit frustrated, knowing I don't have time to get everything done and I'd rather just read for enjoyment. I realize I'll just have to be late with the report, it won't get done in time. Oh, I guess I could do the rest of the report without that information, but I want to get it all in having once thought of it. The old doubts creep in - am I indulging myself in perfectionism, or whatever it is? Do I have to do it thoroughly or not at all? Is it not all right not to do well? Or is this information really necessary and if I just applied myself wouldn't I get it right? Have I been lazy? Nuts. Anyway something different distracts me. Lisa's kite has gotten repaired and we're going to fly it. It's a standard kite-shape and blue - don't know what was wrong with it, but it was taken away for repair before we ever got it up and now this is a big event. I'm turning around and seeing that there are other people here, a fair number. We've gone into another room. This school is built like a stone park pavilion. It's a long open place with walls in between rooms but a walkway all along one (or both?) side(s). This, one end, is a kind of theater-room. It has a puppet stage and a couple of openings underneath it that lead backstage, they're curtained, one red, one blue, plain cotton, and an adult could get through them by getting on hands and knees. The people with me, it seems like they've come to observe or inspect something - we're facing the stage-end of the room. Without stage-sets or anything, you can see through to the outside. The rest of the room is empty except maybe for some props. There's a woman here, who looks something like Eleanor Parker - business suit, aloof, short hair, slightly disapproving, a taskmaster. There are a few people behind the stage. So the business of the kite comes up. People are gathering to see it go, and I'm wondering where Lisa is. Won't she want to be here? I see Becky come up, didn't she get Lisa someone to relieve her? Becky's looking very ritzy herself - hair in a classy knot on the back of her head. I go down the passage to see if I see Lisa - she's at the other end. For some reason I don't want Becky to know what I'm doing so I keep an eye out, and just casually step inside the room sideways rather than walking straight in. There's a lot of people in here - they seem to be at long benches crosswise in the room - I think they're all adults - it's not a class, exactly, but more organized than a library. Lisa is up at the front, helping people (pretty much as she does as a librarian), and I wave to her, mouthing the word ""kite"" and pointing. She sees and gestures a response - I guess she'll be coming when she can. I go back down to where we'll be flying the kite. There's a nice lot of people gathered, we're staying back under the roof of the building mostly, and looking out to where they've got the kite. It's a bare place with some ""dunes"", little hills, tufts of grass on. There's maybe 3 or 4 guys out there with the kite, very gung-ho. I notice Becky has her hair down now, I go back to an opening in a wall sort-of-place, where there's a bit of fence closing off the pavilion opening, and there's some bushes and other plants. I duck under and go up to the fence. There's another couple of people there, friends - one of them is a good-looking young man who's somebody's husband, and one of those people I privately daydream about. He's perched on a ledge and I go past him to my own position. Lisa still hasn't made it yet, but they seem to be determined to carry on anyway. The sky is clouding over, fast - it's getting darker by the minute and frankly even if it doesn't rain we won't even be able to see the kite if it gets up. But they're going on anyway. They start to run with it and bustle around, but can't get it up. Then I see a light, hear a click, don't know what it is at first - then I see what's happening. Since there isn't enough wind they're lighting a lighter underneath the kite to try to make hot air to lift it. This is stupid, of course, but I can't see any way of stopping them. What I'm afraid of is they'll set fire to the kite. I remark as much to my friends. They don't stop, of course, and the sky gets blacker and stormier and they disappear behind a dune on the left and there's a ""pfft"" sound that I recognize. It's the kite going up, of course, and that's all she wrote. There won't be anything left to save - that kind of flimsy paper just goes all at once. What a drag after all that work. Damn. And Lisa still isn't here, doesn't have any idea what happened. Blah. So we all start away from where we're watching, and wander on back to wherever."
"120"	"(8/8/86)"	"I'm visiting somewhere with others, staying at a large place where people do a lot of things, one of which is going to school. Everybody lives here in the complex, students, administrators, teachers, etc. There's an event going on, rather like a graduation, because there are groups of kids in cap-and-gown around. My group is here to facilitate in some way, like members of the wedding, and we're getting ready to leave. I'm going into this room/wing to fetch my brother. The part I was just in looked like a school. This looks more like an apartment, with a kitchen sink and books and chairs. He's been lounging in here, making a mess, and it wants cleaning up. I tell him to... [The sequence of events is no longer clear. I'm guessing.] ...start picking up and he farts around, so I do it, but for one reason or another - somebody bumps me or something - I end up with a mess too. I leave it with some other people and go outside (which is still inside, you see, but there's dirt here, and some planting going on) and start to poke around in the dirt. I'm just doing a little spadework to pass the time until we get going again - there's quite a lot of people around - those groups of kids, some parents visiting their kids, people having discussions, and so on. Presently some of my companions come up and we're going to go see about a young couple we know - I think these people are one of 'em's parents, or other relative, and they've just gotten married. They live in a room down this hall here. We knock, and go in. He's sitting on the bed - looks like Rob Lowe - she's sitting (on the floor?) at the end and there's at least one other visitor. We all chat happily for a bit - I think the older ones leave. By the way, she looks like Demi Moore - they're a fine match. During some event like fetching something from under the bed or bookcase where it fell, Rob pulls out a nasty-looking reptile hanging on by his pointy teeth to a paper or book. He's a lot like the ""monster-sticks"" in Labyrinth they were biting Ludo with. Pinkish, big head, little legs, vicious. He gets it up on the bed, but nobody knows what to do with it. You certainly don't want to pick it up. He's poking at it a bit, though, and I don't think it's funny at all. He might get bitten. Somehow it gets closer to me. I think he knocks or flips it and it ends up near me and I'm nearly panicking. I try to back away and say things like ""Help me! Get it away from me!"" and there's some confusion and when I look round again everybody's gone. Somehow I do get bitten by the thing, and it hurts, There's something thrashing around and a bit of calling for help and somebody does come, and it gets off me. I don't know what happened to it. It's not visible, but I don't know if somebody took it away, or it ran away. There's somebody with me, I'm gasping, looking around, paranoid, hoping there's not more. I've got a splinter in my hand from thrashing around, which I'd thought for a minute was a bite or a sting, maybe poisonous. I see what it is now and pull it out. It's actually very large and sticking out. Funny. At some point I am reading an entertainment guide, or some such thing. (I think this is after the above.) And I find that Pete Townsend's going to be in town soon. I am real excited about this, and then when I look it over and see that it's better than that (he's doing a musical, for about a week!) I'm even more thrilled. I think maybe there's a chance I could meet him - but it's not that long away. It's very unusual that he'd be doing a show like that, it will be quite interesting to see how it turns out. He's probably doing it for the novelty, to see what it's like."
"121"	"(8/8/86)"	"I'm on a residential street, old-style, like maybe Grandmom's, and I'm outside, going to some other people, I guess I'm trying to catch up with them, except I stop at my brother's house, about midway on the right (my left) and find he's very sick. I shout after the others to come and help me, we've got to get him a doctor, but they don't hear me. I run after them and they won't turn back. I'm extremely upset, not knowing what to do without somebody to help, and these people want me to go with them, saying it's not that bad and somebody else will take care of it. But instead I go back and find that another person has come - female, I know her but she's not close - and called an ambulance and they're here and things are being taken care of. I have to help my brother to the ambulance - he can just hold himself up with assistance."
"122"	"(8/9/86)"	"I'm visiting my ""grandmother's"" house with MB (I think it's her) and I've been out. I come back to find my ""brother"" and his family (wife and small son) have also come for a visit, and he's still up. I come in the front hallway; the refrigerator is standing in it, disconnected. I can see, actually, that there's more than one about; it's as if someone had been trying to find one that works - they're all pretty old, and the one that is connected (in the other room now) is real small, black, sits on 4 legs and looks like an ice chest. Out in the hall there's also a styrofoam cooler with some of the food in it, including the cat food. I come in hoping my grandmother won't get up, but she does - she's anxious to blame the refrigerator situation on me and anybody else who's handy. My brother doesn't seem to be doing anything but taking up space - he's got a book, or something else, he's absorbed in. I go to my room to get MB and bring her out to feed her. I have to watch carefully to see she doesn't get into things/places she's not supposed to, including my grandmother's bedroom. She's very inquisitive and easily distracted. Later (daytime now) I go out with some friends. I'm not at all sure what we were doing, but where we are is right next to a large group of people, having a fighter practice/revel in an empty lot on a little business street with one-story brick buildings. They're across the street from us, on a corner. I'm talking to a girl next to me about them - she suggests I go on over there, since I'm so interested. I am interested, in that they are having a very good time, but carousing like crazy. Of course I think they don't look very medieval, but then I wonder what a real medieval carouse would have been like. Hmm. I say I don't have anything to wear and she says there's something here, I can use that. Where we are reminds me of a beach house, or some such thing - we're in a front part, something that corresponds to a porch, then there's a hall with a recess, then another room, then outside and sunlight. I think it belongs to a guy - he's in the back. I try pulling something off to try this garment on. (I think the guy sitting next to us is going, too.) Can't get very far with it without taking more off, so I go down the hall to that recess. Through a door is a small space where I can take my dress off, but the door doesn't lock. I'm a bit worried about somebody coming through and once somebody does, but I turn away holding my top up. There's a television in here, I guess - this guy remarks on the show that's on - it's a new sitcom called ""Beach Party"", starring Adrian Zmed, about the usual sort of funny-youth-romance sorts of thing. The subject of this show is that one of his friends can't work up the nerve to ask this girl out. I'm aware of the show and that it's only been on a short while and already been cancelled. I remark to the guy that I've never seen it at all and I wonder how come they didn't show it there."
"123"	"(8/16/86)"	"I'm in the Circulation office at work, sort of ""borrowed"" because they need help and I can spare the time, also as a trial to see if I want to go back to work here. It's not like it really is - it's an old, wood place with wood furniture, mostly dark and used-looking, maybe some painted, kind of like an office would have been in the 30's or 40's, but the computers are here and it's very busy. There's a lot of people here, a lot of them quite young, and I get the impression it's like a school or a family, and the older ""kids"" bring up the younger ones. I seem to be looked up to here. Alma really wants me to come back, because she needs my experience and talents. I'm feeling happy, needed, enthusiastic, optimistic; I like it here and it seems like I've come back home. At one point I'm sitting at a table with some other people and Mildre comes by. She's reporting the results of my evaluation or something, it had been some kind of joint effort of all the administrators. They'd all had a turn talking to me, then gave me a grade. Mildred says that I'd done very well overall, everybody gave me very nice grades except that she's given me a C- because of the way my attitude changed when we started to talk about [evaluations?] I'd become sullen and [?] , she says. But it wasn't enough to pull the whole average down, so I passed anyway. I resent this a little, but then I resent this whole examination process - as though all these people are such big shots they get to pass judgment on little insignificant me. But Mildred and I are friends and I know she's just doing her job the best she knows how. Later I'm out in a car looking for a friend of mine - don't know her name but she's blonde. I finally find her in a spot, more like it used to be (this neighborhood is old, too). I pull the car into the little driveway and get out to talk to her. We've got someplace to get to right away and it's taken me a while to find her. She agrees to come with me, and I start off on foot around the corner on the sidewalk. The little street is just a sort of tiny neighborhood shopping corner, has some awnings - it's closer-in than Cedar Springs. I've gone a little way down the street and I see she's not with me, so I turn back. When I step around the corner, I'm face-to-face with an enormous black bull, fighting mad. I'm stunned and stand very still for a second, then back up slowly. As I get around the corner again, there's people around, and I start to warn them. Then the bull comes around the corner too, but slowly, and another, smaller, one comes with it. Everybody, including me, starts to run down the street. I crash into things but get up and keep running. I don't know what's happened to my friend. It looks as if she's hiding out and never meant to come with me at all - maybe she sent the bulls."
"124"	"(8/16/86)"	"I'm in a house, I think I've been renting and I'm moving out. It's old and weatherbeaten and the roof leaks. Right now that's the issue of the moment. I've found it's leaking in the bedroom corner again and some other places I hadn't known about. This is getting really desperate. I'm looking in a big closet, that I usually don't use, for something to catch leaks and find the wrong sorts of things. I have to come through the back of a very big room which is being used for a dress rehearsal of a musical show. The floor is filled with people dancing a routine in fancy dress. I'm in this show somehow. I'm being Robin Hood, which isn't just a part in a play. It seems to be a sort of SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM-role with a regular band of men to lead and all, sort of clubby. I'm taking it over from Bill (I don't know if it's permanent or not), and when I see him back outside of the room in another part of the house he says he'd meant to call a meeting of Little John and the others but hadn't had time. We get in a van by a side door; we're talking about somebody else and I mention some car models this guy and I built. When I go to pull them out to show Morgan I knock them on the front floor and exclaim something, but I'm not actually worried about it. The cars - three - are mainly intact. I pick them up and then scoop up some debris from the floor and take it into the kitchen (we're right at it) and throw it away. Back in the van I see bits and pieces on the floor that belong on the cars (and some that may not, like a teeny plastic toilet) and sort them out. Then I realize there's some other things missing and I must have put them in the trash. I go get them out. When I do, I pull out a spider web stuck on the end of the paper, with a fly dangling from it. I remark that there's one spider who doesn't waste any time, and scrape the web back in the bag. I find the pieces, little headlights and so on, and take them back to the van. Morgan goes off somewhere and I'm pondering what it means to be Robin Hood. I'm still dealing with leaks, though, and when I'm looking again somebody breaks in. [I'm not clear on this point - did they knock at the door and break in when I answered, or did they break in and find me first?] It's 2 men - one older, in a suit, short grey hair, executive-looking. The other is a younger, not-very-scruffy, henchman. They want something I don't have, I don't know what, and I'm really quite scared, but as we go down a big wide hall I somehow thwart them and get the gun away from them. I point it at them and they run away. I open it up to take the bullets out - I don't really know how and may not be doing it right, but at least some are out. It opens up lengthwise on hinges and seems to be padded inside like a jewellery box. I'm worried they may come back after it and hide it up high somewhere. At some point I go through a room where a friend of mine is talking to her young daughter. [I think it must be Brenda, though I'm not sure, but only because I think the kid is Angela.] She's renting the place from me (remember, I'm moving out?) and the daughter is cleaning up this room. There's another room being built right next to this one, and she says that they'll (her husband and her) be sleeping in that one, even though it's smaller and not as nice, because the daughter wants this one, but she's going to have to get the hardwood floor in condition first. It's been left to itself and looks terrible, but it's very solid and well-made. She gets down to look at the width of the boards and seems to think that's a sign of a good wood floor, the newer ones use wider strips. I don't know. Later I'm in a department store at the perfume counter. I'm looking in particular at one scent, noticing the bottle I'm holding has an extra name on it (like they do so often now - a standard name is used with a ""surname"" as though it's a version of the original. When I look at the rest of the packages I see they all have surnames, as if there was no plain one. I wonder if they're just out of the plain one, or they're not making it anymore, or am I mistaken and they never did make a plain one?) The saleslady is still talking to the other customer. I put my purse down and look at some other things. In a minute, I see what I think is my purse up on a shelf behind the counter and I wonder how it got there - did the saleslady put it up there? There hasn't been time, has there? I go down and look, but it isn't my purse at all. For a second I'm disoriented, thinking I've forgotten where I left it - but it's down at the end of the counter, right where I was standing. I've gone out and I'm walking down a shopping-strip walk when I run (literally) into my brother. He's got a rather New Wave hairstyle. Vicki's with him. He says, you run into people like this a lot? And I say I was looking at the ground (which is true), and didn't see him. Vicki says, you remember you were supposed to be at our house on December 11? And you left too late, or something like that? I say, I think that was the time I thought I knew where I was going and found that I didn't - I stopped at Mom's for directions but she'd already left."
"125"	"(8/26/86)"	"I'm in a place where I work - it's rather like a workshop, a wood building, not very big, small staff - it's rather late to be here, darkening outside, we're leaving for home. I'm taking a cat (MB?) with me because she's sick - I'm going to my house. I'm driving on an open road - there are other roads that don't quite criss-cross, but curve around each other, and I take the wrong one. I round a curve to the other side of the road to make a [wonky sort of] U-turn by heading into a ditch and turning around again, facing the car out of the ditch. I hope the car will do it. It does. I come back onto the road and among the (very light) traffic from the direction I'm now going comes a guy on a bicycle. He closes in and is ding me - there's something suspicious about him and what he's doing, I think I need to get away from him. I knock him over - by swerving the car or something - and drive on, but I'm sure he gets up and follows me - or at least keeps going my direction. I arrive at my house, and he goes to the house next door. Inside my house, in a sort of garden room, I can see through a kind of window to the window of the house next door. He's with a group of people, sort of a small party, and he can't see me. I like this house. It is my house, I live here, but it's as if I don't usually see it this way. I get up and go looking around at things, and the sensation is as though my time here is usually a dream and this time it's real - and the more I think that, the more intense the feeling becomes. [I am still at this writing aware of the sensation, though it's fading.] This isn't a dream at all, I'm really here. I go from room to room - this is a slightly upscale suburban-type house, one story, with untypical-of-me contemporary furniture, carpets, plants, lightish colors, things like apricot and tan and peach or gold. The garden room is not a patio, it's well inside the house with (I think) only one outside wall. It's for relaxation and comfort. There's a good-sized den, the sort that's wide open, kitchen on the other side, long couches and soft carpet, cushions. Then I go to another room that's dark. I find the switch to turn on the lights, but they don't come on. It's pitch black and I can't even see what kind of room it is, but I thought it was a bedroom. It's a little unnerving. I go to the next room and the same thing happens with the lights, but after a minute my eyes begin to adjust and I can see dimly that it's my real bedroom and not in this house at all. I realize that I'm slipping back into the real world. I don't want to, but it's happening too fast to do anything about it. I'm disappointed."
"126"	"(8/26/86)"	"I'm in (an?) apartment with (My brother?) and someone comes to the front door to sell some service - don't know what kind. I certainly don't want it, and I'm rather suspicious of him. But he isn't going away - he's looking towards his companions not far away (in a car?) as though they're getting ready to do something. I shut the door and lock it in several places - it's even 2 doors, and they each have at least 3 locks. My brother comes up, and I explain what just happened. He says he'll take care of it. This has to do with cats (MB?) again."
"127"	"(8/27/86)"	"I'm in yoga class - it's near the end, and the end of the day - dusk is falling and the lights aren't on. [The studio is the same except for a few modifications and some outside windows that aren't there in real life.] We're doing the posture where you sit on your feet and bring your knees up, but we're doing it for a long time. Or supposed to; I haven't got it straight yet and I'm not doing it right. George hasn't noticed for all this time and now it's time to stop. As we're all getting packed up to go, he calls 2 or 3 of us over to see if we can do it better with some props, blankets and things. I don't go first and I do something else (in another room off the studio that isn't there), and when I go back they're putting the things away, so I don't do it. Everybody else is leaving, but I'm hanging around with George, and we go out and downstairs together, talking. At the bottom of the stairs he looks out for his ride, and right away a car pulls into the parking lot, and he says goodbye and goes to it. I say goodbye and look for my own car, which I expect to be in one of the rows on the right side of the building (as you face the street) but I don't see it. I'm not positive just which spot it should be in, but I look up and down and don't see it at all, though there are several small white cars. I continue around to the back of the building, and a bit further, into an empty lot with a few trees and a little shack/house on it. As I come around that, I see an old black man talking to another man (white, I think) who's leaving, and the old man goes on into his shack. There's a kitten outside of it, black and white, I'm seeing it from a distance that I mostly see it as a silhouette, not a personality. It's playing, hard, and jumps up and down. It jumps high once and lands hard on its side, rather as though somebody had slammed it down. But it Dads up again, higher, and this time lands on its feet, slowly and gently. I go on around the building to the front again and find a group of 4 or 6 women under the stairs, one of whom is Susan. They've all come out looking for their cars, and haven't found them, just like me. (It's not one per person, actually, so it's not so many cars as all that.) They're trying to figure out what to do next. It's beginning to look as if they've been stolen. Seems like a foreign idea, but, well, what else could it be? (To tell the truth, we're all behaving as if this is so weird, it must be magic.) I walk back out in the parking lot again and turn around - then I realize I never parked over here at all - I parked in the front, where I usually do, near the bottom of the stairs, facing the building. I had been thinking I parked over here with some friends in the class, but I didn't. I walk back to the front, look, and there's my car, all right. I feel very foolish, but you got to admit it's funny."
"128"	"(8/30/86)"	"I'm out travelling somewhere (walking or driving?) and come upon a nice little shop, old-timey, sort of middle-aged lady running it. I look at some of her wares. There are laces and linens. Next, I'm arriving at home - I live with my family. My parents have left my sister and me in the house while they're out of town. While I've been out, my sister's had a party. It's a big one, too, the kind where they take over the house and do anything they want. I'm disgusted and appalled. Also insulted and ashamed of my sister. I go to my bedroom. It's a shambles and there are several people carousing in it. I stand looking for a while, then say very forcefully: ""This - is - my - bedroom. Get - out - now!"" They do, while I stand there and look. Yuck. My sentiment seems to have spread, because everybody's leaving the house. I'm glad, but I am also apprehensive of my sister's reaction - she may be mad at me for running off her friends. But I meet her in the hallway and she's not mad - she's rather relieved, a little ashamed of having it turn out like that. I wonder when Mom and Dad will be home. She says she thinks they're not coming back at all. Next, (we go outside somewhere on the grounds or nearby?) I'm outdoors on a large open lawn where there's a ceremony taking place. There's a lot of people gathered around, and a circle of women in similar costumes: very fancy dresses with huge skirts and I think headdresses. I'm not sure if it's entirely dark outside, but the light isn't daylight anyway, and we're seeing the women as sort of silhouettes. They're changing colors themselves; their whole images, not just the dresses, gradually change in color and pattern (kind of like ""transporter"" dissolves work). When this is finished, the ""lights"" come on again and it's daylight. You can now see that the dresses aren't all one color - one group is red, one blue, one black, etc. - I'm not sure how many, but there's 4 or 6 alike in a group, except for the last group at the far end of the circle, whose dresses are varied, some of them even multicolored. These are the head people, like they're in charge of the ceremony. Now they're doing some stuff, some talking. And now the whole thing's over and everybody's leaving. Some have to stay behind to pack up their things - I'm helping somebody (friend? relative?) who took part and there's a small wooden case with drawers to pack up. Something like a tool chest. Then I leave with somebody else. Next I'm driving down a busy street with this person, female, don't know who - don't think she's my sister. The traffic is real fast and I'm driving on the left. It seems like a perfectly normal thing to do until a car comes straight at me. I quickly look around and there's no place to go on my right. It goes through my mind, ""Oh, yeah, I forgot I'm in England, they drive on the right here"". I close my eyes and cut the wheel hard to the left, thinking it's too late anyway. I may have said something to my companion, like ""Brace yourself - we're gonna crash."" But we don't. What we do is go down an incline (fairly steep) to the parking lot of a little shopping area. [Where we were driving wasn't open road, but a place something like the high street in a lot of English towns.) We decide we may as well get out and partake of the nearby restaurant as keep on driving in that mess. So we go up to the outside window and get plates of food to take to the patio-sort-of-area. It's not a fast-food joint, but very relaxed and casual. My friend passes in front of a big blondish man. I don't quite see what happens, but he sort of knocks over her food or something, then starts talking to her, all very jovial and what-fun-we're-having. He even takes some of her food and I'm wondering if this isn't some clever form of gregarious panhandling. I am very protective of my own food. Where he's sitting is some steps, next to a brick divider with plants in it, and there's a bit of a place to sit next to that. My friend comes up there an we sit to eat. The man turns toward us and keeps talking. I'm feeling sort of imposed on, but not terribly. He is sort of handsome and rather fun. But I don't want him to eat my food."
"129"	"(9/15/86)"	"With John Boats and a couple of friends outside near maybe a farmhouse, with trees and sunshine - talking about (something nostalgic?) - a huge machine starts operating - it's for construction of something, like a highway - but it's not supposed to be going now and it's going to smash us all - we run - people scatter - I'm going to try to reach the car."
"129a"	"(9/15/86?)"	"#129a (9/15/86?) Scene in a Training, just setting up - I just arrived and I'm checking for something to do - it's in a kind of theater again, old wood building, dark in the theater area - there's an errand wants running and I'm getting instructions. [Some involvement with the parking lot here - did I go out to it and then not know what to do, or did I come in after being in it and not being sure where to go?] In a store or something - I'm on a landing at the top of some steps (inside the building), where the cash register is - I see George down below and go down a few steps to speak to him. He says he's here to do some [bodywork?] on somebody in the SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM - I'm surprised and he says he does this every Training, working on the new lords. I'm shocked - I had no idea that the two were connected at all and that the Training produced SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people, especially not ranks. This is amazing. Later I'm somewhat around the corner from my previous location where I get hold of something with honey on top - the person dispensing it put way the hell too much on it and it's beginning to slide off. I get some on the floor, and awkwardly move around to a white porcelain sink, the kind with white knobs and a curved base. It's all over my hands now and I don't know how I can do anything without making a bigger mess, but eventually I get it all off. Yuck. Then I'm coming to the LT Center, which is in the place where the Bank is - sort of as if it were the spot where the ATM/post office is except you enter from the back. I'm driving a car, and waiting to turn left into the driveway. It's snowing or has been, there are drifts everywhere, idyllic but not much problem. As I wait I see that old man from the library, the volunteer, having just left this place, going along the sidewalk to my left. He seems to be going slowly and carefully, as if he were stiff and feeble. I don't want him to see me, so I keep my head turned the other way as much as I can. Someone else comes along the walk to him and helps him along his way. Then I turn into the drive, back to the parking slots. It's all quiet and snowy back here. My car has turned into a bicycle. I park it between two cars and go in. There's a sort of anteroom with a divider from the lobby, before the offices. [It's as if you came into the Center from the door into the classroom.] There are a lot of people around. I wanted to see Sue but I'm not sure I'll be able to with all this going on. I can hear a typewriter clacking away in the ""spare"" office. There's a blonde girl on my side of the partition. I know her by name but not so well. We say hello. I have my right elbow up for some reason, and she puts her hand under it and starts lifting me up. It takes a couple of tries before it works right, but then she's lifting me up and down very easily, like lifting a dumbbell - it's fun.......Seems to skip right into me being outside again, everybody else has left and I'm saying goodbye to Sue, she's in her car reversing out of the spot and I'm getting on my bike."
"130"	"(9/20/86)"	"It's daytime, Sunday morning about nine, and I'm driving down the street on my way to breakfast and laundry. There's construction just after I turn on to the street, and a black man, fairly thin, wearing a workshirt, short hair, grouchy face, jeans, is standing in the right-hand lane in just the position where I have to edge around him into the traffic, which is heavy and a little dodgy because of the construction stuff. He could move easier than I can get around him, but he just stands there with his arms crossed in front of him, looking sullen, like ""Dare me - go on, hit me"". I do get around him, and still have to keep slow because this man and woman are dashing across the street, not at the crosswalk, but in a very awkward place and everybody has to stop or dodge them. Honestly. I pass a restaurant in the middle of the road, a small place, roundish, lots of glass so the customers can look outside. As I pass I see Bonnie in there, her family just being seated. I think she's looked up and seen me, but I've gone by too fast to wave or anything. I've just noticed what I'm wearing, as though I just threw this on and dashed out without looking - it's a T-shirt and a tan tweed skirt, bias-cut, rather well-bred looking, I'm thinking I look sort of casually classy. I keep pulling my glasses off and rubbing my eyes; I can maneuver pretty well without them, but I'm very aware that if a cop were to stop me for anything I'd be in trouble. I decide I'd sooner have breakfast and do the laundry at a laundromat than go out to my mother's, so I start thinking about where to go. I go on down the road, down the hill, and it becomes Turtle Creek Park, more nearly like where Fairmount goes down than Lemmon. It's darker, as if it hadn't actually dawned yet, and the atmosphere is like about 6.00 am. I've decided to turn left but I'm stopped by the curb, there's what looks like a road but there's a couple of steps (not a real curb) so you can't drive up on it. I can't quite see this so I put my glasses on. Now, I guess, I'll go the other way, but before I get the car turned around I see Sandie walking along. She's got a pitcher and a glass in her hands with something purplish in. I get out of the car to go talk to her. She's just out for a Sunday-morning stroll, with some breakfast juice, would I like some? I say yes, take the glass and drink - it's rather like grape juice but milder and better. Some friends of hers come up, that she's going out to eat with. They're going to a rather fancy place for lunch and I can come along, but I say no thanks, I really want breakfast - I'm never quite satisfied if I don't get it, but I'll come along and visit with them anyway until I decide where I'm going to go. There's some discussion about the time - Sandie thinks it's much earlier than it is, but I say, no, it's almost 10.00, I think, but one of her friends says it's just 9.16. I do remember now, I saw that on a clock I'd just passed. This restaurant they're going to is not far, and we're actually in it next. It's sort of an elegant little place with white tablecloths and china. Some rather good-looking dark-haired men in suits sitting at one table. I'm sort of aware of them being aware of us. (I certainly wanted to look good.) We're not at a table - somehow it's more like after the meal, and we're standing at a sweets tray (counter-height) with mostly fancy chocolate on it. There are shapes, mainly leaves, delicate things, and made to look like enamelled copper jewellery - indeed some were set up to look like earrings. There is also a log-thing in the center with a thick layer of chocolate around something else. I want some, of course, though I wonder if the restaurant people won't be noticing that I'm not a paying customer. The girls I'm with, however, offer me a leaf, which I take and it's very nice, but I really want some of the log. Someone cuts me off a bit - I really appreciate that. I am going to be pushing off for breakfast, though, and I'm thinking about where to go. I mention a place back up Lemmon that I'd seen from the bus, a French bakery, can't quite recall the name but I think it's got ""Paris"" or ""Parisian"" in it. I keep saying ""dah dah dah"", as if it's got 3 words in the name, but I know it's only got 2."
"131"	"(10/10/86)"	"""Girl/sister miffed - dithery guy on couch in her place"" [I get a picture of a Southern-belle type, blonde, in a Forties pageboy, her clothes switch from a belle-of-the-ball gown to a standard Forties suit or skirt and sweater. She's doing a little foot-stamping pouty business. This guy is one of a set of men who come into the house we're living in, and he's usurped her place on the couch - she certainly won't ask him to move (maybe dangerous, anyway) and she's too prissy to just sit down somewhere else. Wants somebody to take care of it for her. The room fits with her clothes - maroon velvet couch, overstuffed, similar chairs, quaint little floor lamp with fringe, pictures of scenery on the walls.] ""Me in fancy satin robe over regular robe"" [Did I mean ""clothes""? Seems more likely. This satin robe is very incongruous, I don't know why I have it on, especially over regular clothes - it's as if I'm hiding my other clothes with it. It's hanging partly open at first, and I draw it closed while I'm standing here. I'm feeling a little ill at ease.] ""men coming in taking over - sinister"" [Don't know how many, but several, in suits like Forties gangsters - they just sort of walked into the house quietly and took over, I don't know what for - there's been no violence or overt threats, but I know they're up to no good. They're waiting for something, maybe for somebody else to come.] ""milk out of refrigerator - didn't know there, put back in, they'd bought more, lots to drink, offer to men - old dinette in corner of little kitchen"" [I'm in the kitchen, it's a tiny one, with a little dinette set with red flowered plastic upholstery all the way in the corner up against the windows, there are several, bright sunshine, yard outside, corner is in the front of the house, looks out on the street. Near the dinette set is a small refrigerator and some boxes, or wood cartons like Coke boxes. I'm right there and spot the milk behind some of the boxes, not hidden but accidentally left out of sight. I go to put it back in the refrigerator and find somebody's bought more in the meantime and it'll be ded if I put this in - since there's so much I figure we might as well drink it and I offer it to the men."
"132"	"(10/10/86)"	"John Boats is doing a children's Training, for fairly small kids, 5 or 6 maybe - it's not the first, there've been several, but it's still pretty new - taking place in an old building, maybe it was a school but hasn't been used in a while - pretty rough but still homey enough to suit me. Several rooms, mostly small, wood floors, not much furniture. Besides me, I only know about one other person who's here right now, a girl (blonde, medium curly hair) who's leading the kids in a sort of Pied Piper business - that's what she's supposed to be doing, why I don't know, but there's supposed to be music and the stereo's broken, so she's got headphones on so she hears it and parades around to it, and the kids follow. The whole business is sort of low-budget, what with the building and furnishings and all - it's sort of do-the-best-you-can time. I think John is slightly embarrassed about it (but only slightly). Oh, Linda Thomas is here, too - I think some others are now as well - and she's reminding me of the time - it's late afternoon on Sunday, and she reminds me I have a ""Tuesday night class"" (to teach). I do think it odd to have a Tuesday class on Sunday and I'm confused for a minute. But the main thing is I'm tired. I turn in the doorway toward John and lean heavily against it - he says, ""Tired?"" and I just nod, then say yes, indeed, or something - I really am exhausted - I'm just doing so much, one thing after another. I don't know if I can keep this up. I'm coming inside a building - church-y, school-y sort of place; elsewhere in it is a kind of pageant going on, with a bunch of people dressed up in Arabian sort of gear, an ""emir"" sort of head man, underlings and handmaidens, drapes - everything's in orange tones with gold embroidery and that. There's no audience, everybody in the room does something in it. It's almost but not quite real, actually. I'm supposed to be subbing for Ella, who can't make it for her part. I don't know anything about it but I understand you can fake it. I'm dressed in a sort of harem costume, all covered but you can still see how I sort of fall out of it, and Kora is with me giving me a lecture on how I'm getting fatter - ""Just look at yourself"", he says, ""Do you realize how much you've gained from a year ago?"" ""You've got to stop this eating so much."" I'm a little down, but I still don't think it's all that bad, is it?"
"133"	"(10/20/86)"	"Another bus ride, out on the edge of downtown on a dumpy little road with shacks - actually I'm with a group of women and we're waiting for a bus, or going to one, and we see a little house with a porch and a lot of clothes for sale - advertised as ""Amish"" [though I'm sure they wouldn't be] , with lots of embroidery on cotton gauze. Nice but dubious - I'm encouraging us to go on, we need to catch our bus. Later: after a King's Feast, it's dark, lots of people I know there including Jimmy and Amanda, plus Peter Lawford and Elizabeth Taylor. Everybody's pretty drunk and leaving one by one but not going but just outside the gates and flopping on some benches to rest up. Even the serving-people are drunk. I'm hanging out with Peter Lawford; we're giggling and joking - he's still got a bit of wine in a little glass, and somebody else has a bit in a same-size glass but it's got a top like a lily with petals. Makes it hard to drink out of. I try it myself and you can't quite get it all in your mouth and it dribbles. Funny. I drunkenly remark ""Hey Peter, look! Do you know we're the only ones here except for Elizabeth Taylor and...this young man?"" (""This young man"" is one of the serving-men, but I've forgotten his name. I'm concerned about that because I know him from somewhere else and I think his feelings will be hurt.) We shortly make our way outside - the night is quite pretty, clear, stars out, and we're all relaxing and being quite companionable. I sit down between Amanda and Jimmy, telling them to move over. Everybody's out here; the serving-people have all changed clothes now - there's Griff, sitting on a bit of fence; they're all seeing us off, sort of, watching out that we leave safely."
"134"	"(*)"	"Thanksgiving or Christmas, going to my parents' house - I've got long hair and a hair-spray-glitter can and I use quite a lot of it - somewhere in a small town, with nice little brick buildings - somebody wants to shoot somebody else - I've just parked my car and he's parked behind me, we're at the curb immediately behind a store-sort-of building (short, flat, like a 7-11) and it looks like he's gonna go looking for the person to shoot. I believe I'll just get out of his way. [Somebody somewhere admires my hair and I tell her she can do the same thing with a can of glitter.] In my parents' house, my brother and my father are out doing something [like getting a Christmas tree] and my mom's pissed off about it."
"135"	"(10/25/86)"	"I'm travelling with a family - mother, father, teenage son and 3 or 4 younger kids, and a couple that's maybe his sister and her husband. We're going somewhere, and the name Lawrence, Kansas, comes up, but maybe it's only a stop. There's a lot of disagreement about the direction to take: we've been looking at the map and the father wants to go kinda straight north and visit somebody we know, but the brother-in-law says there isn't any connecting highway and he doesn't want to leave the road we've been on. He wants to leave the group; it isn't necessary that we stay together, but the father is doing his best to convince him to stay. While they're arguing, I have a look at the map myself. It does look a lot like this northern road just goes straight up and stops, but if you follow it back down a bit you can see an intersection with a big highway that will work just fine for us. So it's ok. The map I'm looking at is white, instead of being a standard one. The place we are, if it's a hotel, is kind of old and we seem to be sort of camped out in a long hallway instead of in rooms. Or it's like a gallery - there are windows open, showing daylight and a view of the town and treetops - we're upstairs - and we have our luggage around. I've sort of made sandwiches for everybody, but ran out of filling and there's bread left over. Also not everybody's eating the bread and I'm gathering it back up in case we need it later. At the other end of the hall the kids are playing, a little noisy. The older son is sort of babysitter. There's one very little kid; she's playing on the floor and has crawled into a tote bag with those strap handles and is puttering about like a windup toy. The son laughs. It is pretty cute. So we make it to this town we want to visit - there's a house where a friend of the family is working as a live-in housekeeper for a young executive - she left our home town to come here and we haven't seen her in a good while. This place keeps her busy, all right - the guy's not mean but he's demanding in that absent way that a lot of yuppies get - don't know any other way to get what they want, very regimented existence. She's a little harried, trying to keep up with him. (She's black, reminds me of a young Pearl Bailey but not a comedian.) I go to see this guy where he works - he's just about as harried as she is, trying to keep up with the demands of his bosses - they've got everything all laid out for their people. The executives get free groceries. There's a small grocery store right here on the office compound. (It's not a high-rise.) But there's not enough time for them to let everybody do their shopping when they want to, or something - they have this regimented, too. All these executives get 5-minute shopping sprees (once a day? I guess) - there's a guard with a gate and he has the schedule. I'm going along with our boy to help him out, but once I get in I get hampered by something and can't get hold of what I want. I look around for the guy and he's already gone. (Geez these guys can't help themselves, can they? Everything has to be done in a hurry.) I take what I do have and go back to the gate. There's a bottle of Canoe on the floor in my way - I assume it's been dropped by somebody and I kick it to one side. As I go through the gate, the guard says that that's the bottle of Canoe that was stolen the last time I came through here. Since I haven't even been in this town before, I assume he was talking to somebody else or some other error. I look at him but keep going on my way. It does occur to me that he was fishing - he's trying to nail a shoplifting charge on me. Why? Nobody's stopped me so far, but I'm beginning to wonder if he isn't maybe going to sick the cops on me. Geez. I go back around to this executive's office. I thought he was getting extra groceries for the visitors at his house, but when I go by I can see a lot of people sitting down to dinner in his office. It's got big glass windows - the interior reminds me of the old Peabody's. I'm not dressed up like they are, I guess I better go on back to his house and not interrupt his dinner party."
"136"	"(10/31/86)"	"I'm in an elevator lobby - looks like a hotel but it's a lot like a department store, too, and it's really the library - where I work. There's a bunch of doors, but the regular elevators aren't coming and I get on this one off to the side, that was a temporary installation for a special event. All the place is pretty elegant, even this ""extra"" one, but this one is a bit flimsy. When I get to the floor it's as if the walls don't go all the way up, like a screen. The building has a lot more floors but this elevator goes only from 1-5. Apparently they aren't used as much. It has a bend in it for some reason, for a minute I think I can get out the back opening, but I can't. I go out the front. This may not be the floor I work on, but I know the people here. I'm turning to go to the office, and here come two great big black panthers. They're behaving a lot like guard dogs, checking me out. I'm scared, but not big scared, since they're not attacking. I'm pretty sure they will if I do the wrong thing, though, and I'm anxious to get away from them. I carefully sidle away - they lose interest and go over to a counter, around the corner from the bank of elevators, and investigate a very small child. The kid is snatched up quickly. I'm thinking maybe guard-panthers is not such a good idea, people will complain. I go find the office, and talk to Sherry for a bit. I see a flyer for a music festival. It sounds really neat - I tell Sherry I'd really like to do this. She says her whole office is going, it's a big party of theirs. I only just came back from there but I don't know why I shouldn't go back this soon if I want to. I'm very excited. I tell Sherry how I liked the place and want to go too and she says sure come along. I'm stopping to visit at a house; I have a companion but I don't know who he is. The house is a nice little frame one where a man lives with his daughter. They offer me a bit of a cake that came in a box with a cellophane window on the lid. It's not big and it's not all that good but I keep going back for more. I sneak other little bites and finally cut off a big chunk and butter it. Then I figure I better have 2, so I take another and start to hide it in my jacket. Then I realize how little of the cake is left, and they've got hardly any for themselves and they'll certainly know where it went. But I don't want to put any back. I guess I will, though, but I may not have the opportunity. I'm getting ready to go somewhere, that's why I wanted the cake for later. I go and come back. The guy I'm travelling with is outside trying to turn the van (or car) around in the driveway - having trouble. He says the man in the house just up and died, so he couldn't help. I'm quite surprised. The guy wasn't all that old. He says he just keeled over. It crosses my mind that we'll probably be left something of his property because we were there when he died."
"137"	"(10/31/86)"	"I'm with a group of people, which includes my brother, but these others are a family of their own and I don't know them very well. We're in a house or an old hotel. We're supposed to be leaving and they're not packing up to go. I've already cleaned out my room and I'm pissed off because they're not ready. I've waited and waited and this isn't the only thing I'm not happy about. I decide to stomp off on my own. I go on out and down the street. There are young punk kids around, not too sleazy, some of whom look me over and that, and I just stick my nose in the air and keep on going. Shortly I remember I haven't got my luggage with me (or at least something important I have to go back for) and I turn around. The street is kind of residential, kind of not, one of those old streets in a city that aren't popular anymore, a little tired. Some brick buildings. I go back and look for my stuff. I have to step over things to pick it up - it's next to a small table, there's other baggage, electrical cords, and so on. The others are still lounging. This man, may be the ""father"" of this family, but I don't think so, is not a bad guy, but neither is he the most respectable person around - he makes smart remarks and tries to be superior. He says something to me, and calls me ""Monopoly"", which I resent - he apparently thinks it's funny - they all think I'm funny, of course, since I'm serious about my business and stick to the program and things like that. This time I've had enough, and I say to him, ""I want you to stop calling me 'Monopoly' - it's not my name; it never has been."" He looks a little taken aback but maybe he'll stop. ""I was only being friendly"", of course. I go into another room where a man is still shaving - I'm looking for something, I checked my room but it wasn't there. This guy also has a real nonchalant attitude, but he's nicer than the other. Something hurts me now [can't say what - it isn't coming back to me now] and the guy says he can help. He gets a pencil that's a combination of red and blue lead and shows me, you have to get it quite soft (and the colors blend together) - rubbing it with his thumb on the end. Then he draws with it on my face. Presses down firmly and I can tell he's leaving a mark on my face but he says it'll help. I guess it does. Afterward, when some other people come into the room, I look into the mirror, and I see he's drawn it across my upper lip and down both sides, like a handlebar mustache and the colors mixed to become brown. I wonder if he did that on purpose as a joke. Later, at my grandfather's house: I've come with some people (those others above?) to the street where my grandparents used to live and seen that it's changed a lot. There's a kind of upscale look to the neighborhood and there's a small lake behind some of the houses. I go sit on the back step and see that the lake is right up next to the yard and into it a little. Then I notice with a start that there are buildings in the back yard. No, it's not buildings in it, it's the backs of some condos jutting into the yard. Someone must have sold off part of the back yard and those places are using it crosswise as their back yard. I'm sorry - the end of an era and all that - it's not as nice as it used to be - all this artificial fun (the lake, boats, and all) and artificial class (the condos). Then I'm in my bedroom waiting for Lori. I hear flute music and it gets louder and I realize it must be her, coming up the stairs, though I can't hear the steps creak. I didn't know she'd learned to play the flute (or pipes) and wonder if she'd just learned and I figure she's playing them up the stairs to announce her arrival, like Lyn does. I'm going into the living room to let her in, and I can just see her head and shoulders through the window - she's wearing a cloak with hood, which is up - she looks different. But the music doesn't seem to be coming from outside and I look around. Then I can't see Lori any more - I can't see anybody outside. That bothers me, and I go to draw the curtains. They have drawstrings now, but I can't get them to work. I can't get one to go across without the other. The music is still going on."
"138"	"(11/20/86)"	"Barbara and I are travelling somewhere and get stuck or stranded in some rain, and when it's over we go up to the highway and try to walk across. Only it's muddy. We're both dressed pretty nice but it just doesn't matter any more and we go on anyway. When we step out we find it's muddier than we thought and sink a bit. Then more. Then a whole lot more, and suddenly we're up to our chests and flailing for the curb. We make it there and need help getting up over it. We hang on and yell for help - there isn't a road shoulder but a drop-off with some steps, down to the service road. And some people down below. A guy comes up to help us; somebody else helps him, they haul us up over the curb and down to the street. Then he asks us for money. We're very surprised and insulted. I give him a traveller's check, without much grace, and we go on off down the road. As we turn a corner around a store, I realize I only just handed him the check from the pack, I didn't sign it; it won't be any good. I think that's fine - we'll just disappear and he can't find us. I start hurrying, but he catches up and I have to make it good. We need a place to stay - he takes us down the street to a house where an older couple live, maybe a bed and breakfast sort of place, but there's nobody awake. He takes us in anyway, and we look around. I look in the mirror at myself and find I'm not actually covered in mud. Messy, damp, but not mud-coated."
"138a"	"(11/20/86)"	"#138a (11/20/86) Somewhere, in a place like the Administrative Wing, there's an office like Mr Slaughter's or Jan's - beyond it is an open space. All the walls and panels are a medium dark peach. The lighting is indirect and down some. Seems like night. I'm looking into this ""office"" - which is bigger than usual - and there's a large incubator-type thing in it. I can see it has something alive and furry in it so I go look. There are actually 3 human babies in it, all asleep, and 3 huge guinea pigs, and some large hamsters. Somebody has told me to go look at the hamsters, but didn't mention the babies. I consider that odd. It seems to be some kind of experiment.I'm in a house with a young girl. I'm visiting, I don't know anybody here very well. Seems like she has a younger sister. We are going somewhere, and next door stop at a little house with bushes out front that have candy bars on them. She's looking over one and I see she's got a Violet Crumble in her hand. I'm delighted and start looking for one of my own. I'm listening to a girl whine at me, everything's wrong with her and her life, etc. As she turns to me, I see a crystal. I guess she'd been wearing it but I see it separately. It's clear but has green inside it and another color outside - maybe part of the setting, another stone. It has a silver cap on it."
"139"	"(11/20/86)"	"I'm at Sue S's house, helping get ready for a Training - it's also the Center. We've had our meeting and cleaning up but people keep coming for other things. The room has been set before but changed - by Sue and somebody, I think - now it's not all straight but nearly. I'm looking in a corner at a small tree and there's a bit of branch with some root attached I want to throw out but, it's attached to the other root system and I'm not sure I should. I try to find somebody to ask and they're all too busy. I see a mother and her 2 daughters have come - both girls dressed in green jumpers, white blouses, school uniforms - Oxfords - one girl has red hair. They're being taught to use the phone. I'm kinda pissed off because I can't get my questions answered, but the branch has come loose from the rest anyway. I put it down and go into the living room. I know this room is usually lived-in and not part of the Center, but sometimes it's used. I go to the front door - maybe just to see, but I think I open it at a knock, somebody comes in. I'm on the porch, and suddenly I'm swept off my feet by somebody. Turns out to be Dan, who doesn't do that sort of thing. I get crushed and carried back to the classroom. We lie down facing each other, propped on elbows - he's elated, so happy and excited he could burst. I notice he's wearing a skirt - a jeans-type skirt, I wonder if it's some new fashion for men, when I see he's wearing a blonde curly wig. I ask him if anybody knows he's dressed like that - he says no, this is the first time - and he's going to dress like this on his camping trip with Lynn, and sleep in a ""funereal"" box. I let that pass for a moment and then say, ""Dan did you mean to say 'funereal' box or [something else that rhymes, but it's not coming to me now] ?"" He looks taken aback and says ""I thought I said [__} - gee, they sure do sound alike, don't they?"" Silence for a while. Then Mark crosses my mind, and I think of AIDS, and I ask Dan if he ever... and he says no. I'm relieved but still worried and unsure. I'm driving a car with Lou in the front seat and Garrett in the back, coming up to a place downtown that you have to turn left or right. I get in the lane to turn left. Luis is getting out here and abruptly leaves without saying goodbye or anything. I remark on this to Gail, and turn left."
"140"	"(1/9/87)"	"I'm travelling with a girlfriend who wants to find her mother (or her mother's grave - I think she knows she's dead). Also with us is Bill , and we're like detectives or something, though not partners, and we're going along to help her. I don't know where we started from exactly but one place we were was an amusement park and I was coming away from it, going toward the place I'll meet the others, on a residential street that's very muddy (or something that makes it difficult to cross). I want to have a look at this house although it's on the wrong side of the street, and it takes me a while to get there. I don't want anyone to see me looking, so I just look carefully and turn to go. Either I drop something or I'm afraid of dropping something here because I don't want to delay and possibly get caught here. No big deal, actually, I'm not doing anything wrong, but I'm uncomfortable about it. Anyway I get back across the street. Later we're in a motel room. Morgan's been doing things in the bathroom and the friend has gotten groceries. I've been thinking about our plan and waiting for Bill so I can get in the bathroom. When he does come out, I go in and see this odd sink and quite a lot of toiletries of Morgan's all over, and the ""porcelain"" (it's that molded stuff) wants rinsing off. The sink actually goes up behind the taps, and rises to a shelf to put things on, but it's slanted. I wonder how his bottles and things are staying up. Then, to rinse the sink, I splash water up there and find it flows neatly along the shelf and down. It's made to do that. Oh. And when I move a bottle or two and put them back, I see there's an air-suction slot in the wall behind. At first I thought all these things had magnets on, but they're being held by the air suction. I can feel it when I put my hand up there. Anyway I askMorgan if we're gonna plan our next move and he seems reluctant. Doesn't have any ideas and doesn't feel well, apparently, his main goal is to take care of himself. Later we're at a place outdoors with a bunch of other people, around a place like an open barn (or my px's old garage on Rosedale) and there's supposed to be a wedding but either it's been called off or postponed. It's more like a carnival, these people are just milling around. The reason we're here is we're trying to find someone who knows this girl's mother, (Shelley?). We're really just passing by. (Like ""Route 66"".) There was a wedding cake made in the size and shape of a wedding dress, only most of the cake's already been eaten. You can open up the outer icing like the ""dress"" it's meant to be, and get cake from inside. Nobody wanted to disturb the pretty outside. I go up to see if I can get a taste and a girl (blonde - the real bride?) says, there's some cake left (in such and such a place) - just look for it. Really I only do want a taste and I pinch a little bit of remnant from inside and find it's really pretty bland for a wedding cake. I surely don't want a whole piece. I go back to my friends, and the girl's been putting up pieces of zucchini on a board with magnets - like a display - several of them - just to amuse herself, I guess. The zucchini is cut long-ways, not sliced from the end. The people mill around, mostly saying ""what's this for?"" One guy, a regular loudmouth, sort of takes over and makes a show of doing something to destroy the zucchini - burning them, I guess. He's got everybody's attention, and they're all crowding around him to see what he's doing. My friend is quite hacked off and yells at him he'd better not do that or be prepared to replace her magnets."
"141"	"(1/10/87)"	"I am working in my office but it looks different, and there's other stuff going on. Mick Jagger is working there now, and it's set up more circular. I'm going off to look for Lori, and the place is also a shopping mall. Didn't find her but I poke around in a toy store. Back to office. There's a wedding going on in a big room nearby. Polish or something - there are a lot of people in there. There's something I need to get - a plain white envelope - and after I look around I find they must be in the room where the wedding's going on, so I go through to the back of it past all these people. I'm very self-conscious, esp. since I don't have shoes on, and realize the staff is really supposed to stay out, and leave the people alone. But I get my envelopes and leave. A salesman comes by with some stationery products, starting his spiel as though I were the Purchaser - I explain to him that I'm not - I only talked to him when he was here before because I was interested in Christmas cards, but I didn't send any after all. He's a stocky short guy, foreign, dark, sort of prim, and he's a bit miffed now. He looks like he thinks I'm giving him the runaround, but I'm not. He leaves some cards with me to give to Linda. Mick Jagger comes over to say something. He's really quite a normal sort of guy, doesn't fool around. Not too much anyway - he's fun. However, I'm getting ready to move out of town. Next I'm in a house with my father and stepmother and brother and another girl. (My sister? - don't think so.) I'm probably a teenager. We've just moved in and don't know where things are, haven't got the furniture all in. Nice little old house. I go over where this closet is. It has a big chest of drawers affair in it, not wood, with a bin-opening at the top. It's tall. As I look at it, it moves a little, I see it's on wheels. I pull it out and find a real chest of drawers behind it, old, wood, painted white. I exclaim over this to my brother and what's-her-name, because now we've got plenty of drawer space. [Somehow I get a message - don't know if it's through the mail or I go outside the house or what, something unusual about it.] I get a letter that says the writer's coming to visit soon, and in a tacked-on note, Maxine too. But it's not signed and we're having to speculate who sent it. I figure it's Ted. He said he'd visit, but why Maxine? Why would she want to come out here?"
"142"	"(1/25/87)"	"I keep seeing this guy around - he's pretty good-looking, seems nice, not flashy or even very outgoing, probably younger than me - we go to the same school or work in the same place, I'm not sure - I notice him a lot but I don't ever speak, we haven't actually met - and now he's sitting next to me in a movie theater. I'm with some other people but I'm pretty distracted by him. I think he's with other people too but not with a girl. I get more agitated as time goes on, and very late in the movie he turns his head towards me, leans over very slowly and kisses me. Suddenly I know he's noticed me too, and is as attracted to me as I am to him. I'm shocked, but I turn my head to him and kiss him back, on the lips. I really want him. My feelings are very strong. I don't know if anything is ever spoken, and I soon leave with my female friends; I don't know if he comes with me or not. Later I'm in an auditorium at work, with a short bank of seats with 2 aisles - the seats rise to high windows across that let in sunlight. There are 2 riser-affairs on each outside bank of seats at the front inside corners. They're for speakers to stand on, from the audience I presume, and they're just boxes of wood painted blue with a platform in the center. [The front of the room is presumably open, as a lecture hall or something, but it doesn't figure into this dream.] Some people have just left and I'm one of the last out. As I look at the riser nearest the door, I can see that it sags in the middle and looks worn. I call someone back from the door to look at it, and we agree it is pretty tacky, possibly dangerous, and we really must do something about it. ---Almost forgot, some small children were here, at least one of them stood on the riser and spoke."
"143"	"(1/30/87)"	"I'm in a small place, an apartment or motel room, where I'm staying with my mom and [somebody else - a brother or 2?] . A very abbreviated place, small rooms and flimsy fixtures, like the Motel 6 was. It has a kitchen. There's a telephone on the wall next to the kitchen. It hangs sideways and has a round earpiece and the mouthpiece is sort of the end of the metal rod that you hold. You can't prop it on your shoulder. Mom's not here. Somebody else comes in, a boy (we're all young here) with some clay figures to show us. He takes them out of plastic bags. He hands me a sort of rabbit-lady, and I quite like it, but it's still a bit soft and some of it comes apart in my hand. I'm afraid if I grasp it with my other hand I'll smush it. Or if I put it down. I feel terribly responsible for it. Nobody else is paying attention yet, he's showing others to my brother and I'm sitting there, very uncomfortable, and I would really like to get up and go do something else. Finally I get tired of waiting and I put it down. It does bend a bit but it's ok."
"144"	"(1/31/87)"	"I'm in a car in a residential neighborhood, being chased by another car, don't know who's in it. I have a kitten with me. We turn and dash down the blocks and I finally lose the other car by dashing into a driveway. This is the back yard of a very nice house and the man who lives there is outside. I get out and explain what I'm doing there and he's very nice and accommodating, says sure I can stay. He has a cat too and we talk about cats. The kitten comes out and looks around; I fetch a box-thing like the plastic airline carriers and put him in while we're talking. It's not just a carrier but a port-a-potty for cats, and he takes a very long pee. I'm not exactly embarrassed, but concerned lest I spill it and make a mess on this man's things. I do get jostled a bit but there isn't any actual harm done. I take the bucket out and empty it, put it back in and the kitten pees some more but not so much. Next: I'm (staying) at a sort of resort-place. There's a row of rooms, all a wood building with a board walkway in front with a roof. A bit like a Western sort of town. Barbara's also staying here, not far from me, I'm outside on the walk and I pass by where Barbara is and I overhear her say something about some earrings I gave her, little gold chains (the sort that just look like a loop of chain hanging through the ear). I don't remember her exact words but she wanted to exchange them for something somebody else had, since she never wore them. I'm rather disappointed. She never said anything to me. I feel slighted and I want to do something to get back at her. I go back down toward my room and I'm outside on the walkway and Barbara comes back down this way. She's actually quite cool to me and her voice is sharp. I'm thinking of something she gave me that I can give away or trade. Next: I'm on a beach with somebody else down below a house where we stay. We've both got robes on, not bathrobe-standard but monk-y-looking, though they are for leisure or beachwear. Long sleeves. We're sitting after walking, looking out at the roaring morning sea, contemplating. This is an old guy, my teacher. We've sat there for a long time and the sun's coming up and I'm getting warm. I get up and go up to the house where there's a couple of other people on the porch. They're standing and looking out, too, but mostly watching us. I exchange my long-sleeved robe for a short-sleeved one and go back down to join the old man. (It's got something to do with work.) I'm in my office - nothing like the real one, it's all closed in - yellow light, a bit crowded. Kelly works here part-time but she's looking for another job. She and her boyfriend are eating spaghetti or something at the corner of a table or desk. I'm hungry. Her boyfriend offers me a bite or 2 from his plate and I make a mess, stuff on the table, but not too bad. I gasp. Kelly thinks it's worse than it is, but then we see. She's trying to encourage me to get something done - says, you know I'm going away soon, and then you'll have to do it on your own. Someone comes in asking if there's any cake left - I didn't realize there was any, though I've been sitting right next to it. Also chocolate cookies - ones with chips, little all-chocolate ones, some big flat ones with chocolate stripes. And Mexican cake, loaf-type slices, stacked up. Some pink ones across from me where the cookies are, white ones on my right. I don't know what we do here but there are drawing-boards as well as desks."
"145"	"(2/7/87)"	"I'm with a couple of other people at a crafts show - part of it's outside, part in. Inside I'm looking at some neat jewellery, some I've seen before or at least the same artists. It's darkish here, and there's a big glass case that's very low to the ground, and faces the back wall - don't know what's in front of me. There's an old man comes up, he's delighted with something I did for him [I don't remember what] and thanks me at great length. He's the father of one of the women I'm with and I don't want to upset anybody by asking him to go away. He's [either wearing or has, on his hat] a silver piece, an Art Nouveau woman's head, I think, set in ribbon or something, very pretty, and I admire it, mentioning it to the lady whose booth it is, telling her (since I can't get a word in edgewise with the old man) I have one just like it at home, except his is silver and mine's pewter, without the frills. It came from her shop, she's pleased. He goes away and I look around some more, especially the lighted case where there are loose stones at the bottom. I sit on the floor to look and open the door. (I look up once to see if anybody minds.) It's a sliding glass door with no lock. There are very interesting rocks in here, especially some that remind me of scarabs but aren't quite. There are some brown variegated ones that I hold up to my ears, and look in the mirror. The bigger pieces sit out by themselves and the little ones are in dishes. Someone wants to show me a couple of articles in a box, a green box. One of them is leather with hide still on it and for a second I don't know what it is, then I realize it goes round the neck; first I think it buttons or snaps, then I see it slips on over the head. It's a kind of bib-collar affair, meant for keeping your neck and chest and shoulders warm and the chill out. Very Eskimo-y looking, has a nice woven design on, I like it a lot. Somebody says something about the funny things people get themselves up in, and I say, ""Consider that there was a time when there were no coats - people used to wear cloaks, you know - that was how you kept yourself warm."" I am admiring the collar in the mirror. I like it a lot. We go to a place outside now, I take off the collar. There are a lot of people out here milling around rather like a cocktail party or Sunday after church - not actually looking at things. There's a mirror hanging up on the fence or back of a building and we try things on and look at ourselves. The girl who has the stuff here wants to show me a shawl, she says it's the last one of its group, a specialty thing she did, she thinks I should try it on. She pulls it out and I walk to the mirror with it, looking for the tag and when I see what I think is the price I'm astounded - does it really say $1295? (Actually it has a British pound sign written above it but it's just that affectation.)* It certainly is nice, but not that nice. I open it out and try to pull it straight behind me so as to wrap it around but it keeps getting out of my grip, so as I walk I seem to be flying it out behind me like a flag. Which is okay with me, I feel quite flamboyant. I see in the faces milling around a particular man that I like the looks of - he seems very sharp-dressed, handsome, interesting. Suits me to be noticeable. I go to the mirror, flinging the shawl around me dashingly. I see it's definitely brown and white (looks like an overgrown version of the alpaca scarf Melanie made me), and it goes rather well with the heavy sweater that I can now see I'm wearing. I like it."
"146"	"(2/7/87)"	"I seem to be living with Ralph and his wife in a house or small cabin and they're/we're moving out. Somebody else is helping too. There are also some little reptilian creatures living here, too, and they're just babies - 2 different kinds, one's a dragon, the other's sort of round-headed, there's only 2 or 3 of them. You have to watch them like a hawk, or they'll run around and the neighborhood kids'll grab them to play with and they think it's fun to throw them up in the air and try to make them fly. They don't fly. This is terrible. I run out and scream at the kids and they leave. Now Ralph (he's wearing his ""coonskin"" cap and funny jacket) has discovered somebody's stolen the television set from the bedroom. He's real upset about it, everybody is. We go on moving things. The others are outside and I'm in the front room - it's empty mostly. Ralph comes out of the bedroom looking dejected and sits heavily on a box or trunk next to the door, puts his hands on his knees. Looks defeated. I tell him he's lucky they didn't take anything else, look how much he still has. He cheers up a little, when I hear a call that the kids have the babies again and we go running out. It's terrible. This is kind of a park we're in, the day isn't bright but not overcast, the grass isn't green but not brown, nothing much to be seen, sort of blah lawns. The kids are on the side of the house, throwing the baby animals up, and they're in such sad shape, and I'm really angry - I mean to put a stop to this. One or two of the round-headed ones may be dead, I don't want to look at them, I'm scared. I snatch up a couple under each arm, the others do the same, and make for one of the kids. They're boys, maybe 10 or 12 years old. Cruel. Thoughtless. Mean. Nasty. I'm horrified and furious."
"147"	"(2/7/87)"	"Before: I'm in a theater where a show is on and Tom Bell/Dr Who is the main character - it's maybe a magic show, or something where he interacts with the audience. Theater is small, sort of Victorian, seats run steep, velvet curtains and seat covers. I'm chosen out of the audience (jam-packed, full of kids or otherwise very enthusiastic, active people) to do something (call it a stunt) that has to do with me having something and he chases me to get it. I get to hide first and then run. I go behind the stage: I go up a few little steps in front of me - I'm sitting close to the front, 2nd row, right end - and when I go through the door I see there's an outside door to the street, also open. It's night. I wait my chance, going to the edge of the curtain and peering around, then when the time is right I dash quietly across the stage and sneak up on him (to the delight of the audience). Then I lead him a merry chase, finishing up by disappearing behind the crowd to the right, running down to the front and across to the middle aisle, then back up my own row to my seat. Everybody loves it. Most people don't use that much imagination in this ""event"". The Doctor is foiled, everybody roars. As I sit, I think about how I might have just dashed out the door and run down the street, that would've been fun. But I'd have had to leave my purse and library book behind. The book I could have trusted to get back but I didn't want to leave my purse. [By the way, the scene outside is an empty little street like you might like to see behind a little Victorian theater, and it's been raining, so the lamplight shines on wet streets. There are some trees and bushes, mostly the other side of the street.] Another scene: a man is encouraging me to try clothes on, so I can go to some fancy ball or do. I have got absolutely nothing to wear for it, and I absolutely refuse to consider going in the things he's proposing. I will not - as he suggests - put on these 2 old-fashioned, granny-type long-sleeved cotton dresses and ""somehow"" combine them."
"148"	"(2/13/87)"	"Trying to get to work. It's still dark and I want some breakfast - I'm not all dressed yet, not sure what I've got on top but I've got something casual underneath. I live a few blocks away but I've come to this roadhouse-diner for breakfast but can't go in yet - I run into this girlfriend, she's supposed to be going with me but she says she has a job at last - working in this fancy dress shop she used to work in. She hadn't wanted to do that, but she needs the money bad. She wanted to improve her career. I'm wondering how she'll fare in that place, it's quite classy and she's rather informal - earthy, even. She's not absolutely thrilled with the job herself but she is excited and relieved. I guess it's understandable. Anyway, I'm spending too much time here talking - I need to get on. It's getting late for breakfast and I'll just get something to go, but first I'll look at this house trailer over here in the parking lot - I'm going to be living in it soon, and I've got the keys with me. It has 2 locks in the door (which opens out the back end) and usually the locks will catch when you shut the door hard but I'm having trouble with it. I've seen inside, it's nice enough, a small but comfortable living room. Now the locks won't catch. I twiddle keys and bang the door over and over - nothing. Damn. There's a cat around, he comes over and wants to stand around and try to get inside - I have to keep dragging him or his tail out of the door so I can bang it. Nothing is happening with the locks, I think they're broken. Somebody from the diner comes by to sympathize. Now I know I'm going to be late for work and I can't even go home to change clothes without being later. I take off my robe or whatever it is and I've got on a plaid long-sleeved shirt and khaki pants. That ought to be good enough for work but I don't think it is. If only I had a jacket! And now I sure don't get any breakfast. I'm really frustrated and disappointed now. Getting angry. If a bus came by just now I'd be obliged to take it but I'm not confident about going to work dressed like this and I think I'll go home and change even if it is 8.15. I start for home - I have to go down the street to the left for a bit, then turn left. [Didn't I come in a car? - seems like it.] I'm walking first, then I walk faster, then break into a little jog - I'm not getting the hang of it at first, then it settles down and I run. I'm in a residential neighborhood with lots of trees, tall ones with overhanging leaves making a bit of roof. After a bit I come to a bunch of girls just getting off a bus. They start into the street to walk home, and get in my way. At first I slow down meaning to let them pass, but they don't. They stay in my way and they're walking slowly. I jog in place a bit, then speed up and try to find a hole to get through, but when I try to dart past somebody moves and I run into her. This happens once or twice more and I get impolite and start shoving. They take exception, of course. And I feel a little guilty and nasty but I run on ahead anyway, hoping to leave them out of sight. I don't quite make it and want to get away, so I turn left down a side street. It's got some tall red brick apartments on it - it's starting to get light, too. Somehow I get into a place - an apartment, I guess, though not mine, and I don't remember climbing any stairs, but there are two women here - dressed like suburban housewives, they don't mind me being here - maybe people take shortcuts here a lot. There's a window with a fire escape to my right, I'll go out that and double back so those girls in the street won't see me. There's a little old woman, bent over, dressed sorta like a gypsy, with long stringy black-and-grey hair in the way, though, and she even goes out to the fire-escape landing. Again I have to get round her to get down. Geez. But I do get there and start to go down but there aren't real steps, it's more like a very high jungle-gym and I have to climb down through the center. It's tricky, reaching from platform to platform. Scary. As I go down, suddenly I see there are other people around, on the jungle-gym and out of it. They're dressed in long things, and I finally see they're SOCIETY FOR CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people. They must be here for a demonstration or small tournament or something. A girl on the jungle-gym speaks to me and they all seem to think I'm one of them and expect me to join them. I'm taken aback, this is rather Twilight-Zone-y. This is a bizarre situation."
"149"	"(2/14/87)"	"I've just come back from somewhere and found that ""we"" have been taken over. (""We"", I guess, means the whole country, and by Russia, looks like.) There's not many people around and some of them are in groups in houses packing up to leave. There are some poor people at my house with my parents [not my real ones] , they've taken them in and we're going off together. (Don't know where to.) This poor woman is sitting like a statue while my mother is folding blankets. She has a ragged white one herself and mother takes it last, folds it, adds it to the bundle. I understand what's happened but I'm not taking much of a hand myself. Finally I ask my mother, by the way, I haven't heard yet, are we taking any of our own things? Like clothes, you know - are we just going with what we've got on or are we packing a suitcase or something? You know all my Units pack flat, though I'd hate to have to leave some of the other stuff, I'd be well enough off with those."
"150"	"(2/14/87)"	"It's after such a Russian takeover, and I'm living in a house with the family from ""Eight is Enough"", as well as other ""refugees"" or displaced persons or something, we're all very crowded into one house and trying to work things out. It's not easy. For instance, the bathrooms have low stall doors on them and after waiting to get into one, the boy before me wanted to stop and chat and there are always people coming by so it's hard to get enough privacy to pee. The family's very friendly, though - these other people only just came and are just settling in. I come into the bedroom and this friend of mine wants to talk about the coffee arrangements. She and one of the others - a black girl, younger than me - think it's got to be changed. Something about the $7 a month we pay not covering new equipment. I'm not sure what they're talking about and they're taking it awfully seriously. I feel guilty for some reason, as though the problem is my fault, or maybe I should be taking it as seriously as they are. I give the black girl $5 to start off the contributions and they say some more, then I say, okay, please start over, I don't understand yet - I paid $7 before, and I've just given another $5 to you, now tell me why? They start to talk and just at that moment a whole crowd of people comes through the door, all talking animatedly so we can't hear any more and walking in between us. We give it up. Lots of these people are tenants in this room, some of them new. I get to listening to a guy talking about maybe knocking another window in this blank wall so you can see the sun and I tell him I'd been thinking about bringing a bookcase from my old house and putting it there, maybe we should think about it. I leave the room and find the ""mother"" of the house in the living room, sitting at a desk - I greet her saying, at last I've found you! - and she says she'd wanted to talk to me about my lip color and how I sometimes am overglossed. I say I never wear lipstick and she talks about not liking to wear it, either, and runs over all the same reasons I really don't bother wearing it, it's a waste of effort. She's a nice lady. Short gray hair. Also somewhere in here there's a kids' theatrical being presented outdoors on a sort of plaza, with a bunch of kids in whiteface with bright pastel Indian-paint on their faces and sort of tutu costumes, singing a musical number in formation with lots of arm gestures."
"151"	"(3/26/87)"	"I'm getting dressed in a bedroom (not mine?), standing facing the side of the bed (not mine) with my back to the door. I've got on a rather neat shirt, maybe new, new to me at least, gold-color, not shiny - a sort of basket-weave, with a collar, buttons up to the neck. I look pretty sharp, but I'm supposed to have a black jacket on - my own black jacket - but it's not washed and I can't put it on. It's lying on the bathroom floor [like mine really is] and even if I was willing to wear it dirty, it's crumpled. Besides, it's not really nice any more - it's had most of the color worn or washed off by now and it would detract from the shirt if I did put it on. All the same, I feel rather inadequate without a jacket, underdressed. I'm supposed to be dressed up nice for something that's going on. I'm uncomfortable about it, and hug the shirt around me. I still look pretty classy though."
"152"	"(3/28/87)"	"I work for a rock star (Prince?) and am travelling with him and his girlfriend. The auditorium is being set up and I'm not doing anything much when I remember I haven't set out, gotten their clothes for the show. I'm slightly panicked and hurry back to the place we're sort of ""encamped"". She (the girlfriend) has set up some triangular cardboard boxes as a sort of tunnel into the area and I don't want to crawl through because of my weight, so I have to stumble past them. This place is kind of like a huge warehouse and we're camping in it like little rabbits or something. I go into their ""room"", where clothes and things are. As I do things I overhear her talking to someone, who says how remarkable it is, she's 8 months pregnant and nobody knows. She wants to keep it a secret. The publicity would be awful, and everything would be very messy. (He's black and she's white - they mean to stay together and be a family but don't think they could have any private life if this got out.) She's quite nervous and dithery about the whole thing - not her usual style - and comes in to hand me something, saying keep it for her. I think I should sort of hide it so she can't find it all that easily and keep getting it again (I don't know what it is - papers? - but I know she's only dithering about it out of nervousness) - I put it behind a lamp on a small table, with something that I just put there myself, but it's kinda precarious so I go to put it in (or near) my suitcase, on the floor by the opposite wall. [This is really a room, sort of - there are outside windows in it but they don't let you see out - frosted, I guess.) I'm repacking it anyway and trying to put a couple of new yellow sweaters in it, I've got several crew-neck sweaters there already, a couple more yellow, a couple beige. They mightn't fit. A little girl comes up and looks over my shoulder, her mom not far behind - she asks the usual questions, what are you doing that for, etc. I mention she has a couple of yellow sweaters like these. (Or does she?)"
"153"	"(3/28/87)"	"A friend of mine, who lives next door or nearly, is associated with William Shatner in a business capacity - is she an actress too, or something else? - but I saw her with him by accident someplace - out somewhere, maybe, but I think through a window - and they were behaving like sort of ""pre-lovers"", and I do believe they're striking up a romance. I'm coming back home on the bus and I go by her house. I think I'll go in and ask her about it. She mentions him before I do, and I think either she doesn't want people to know they're seeing each other socially (she's embarrassed about it), or she doesn't realize it herself."
"154"	"(4/2/87)"	"There's a Training going on, I'm participating, and John has given us a sort of assignment to complete, which involves getting a load of underpants washed and stacked neatly in a time-period, plus some other details, I think. I go with another girl to her place - there's a rather dark sort of room, study-like, cluttered with things, old carpet on the floor. This is quite comfortable and companionable after the Training environment, but we remember we have a project to do and it's not ""supposed"" to be easy - we have to keep our business in mind. The laundry basket is on the bed and the panties are in it."
"155"	"(4/4/87)"	"I am incarcerated somewhere with Dr Who (Peter Davisson) in a rather futuristic place, as though it were an episode of the show. I don't know how we got here but we didn't do anything wrong, and the Doctor is trying to get us out. They have him change clothes into a sort of prison uniform but it's green and has a turtleneck and matching socks and all. We've got an accomplice, I don't think he came in here with us, but he's helping us. We've managed to get the Doctor's clothes back, or we've found them, and he's changing and talking about what we're going to do when someone comes in. We're across a partition from the door, so we can't necessarily be seen, but the Doctor doesn't hear them and doesn't stop talking. I try to signal him, then whisper, ""Doctor!"", urgently, but he keeps on talking away and I'm getting scared. If we're caught we're sure to be in big trouble because the Doctor's changed almost everything now, except his shoes and socks, and they'll know what's happening for sure. The Doctor can talk his way out of lots of things, but this would definitely raise the alarm and we didn't want to do that. The plan had been for him to get out and then get me out, after he had some help. Is that right? Or were we all getting out together? Anyway, now he does shut up, and the moment is tense - we're about to be noticed by the men who came in - the first one is a typical bad-guy-in-an-authority-group TV or movie stereotype, and he's talking away to the 2nd, so he hasn't noticed right away. I think the Doctor's going to do some fancy talking and cover for me escaping."
"156"	"(4/4/87)"	"I'm at a place that's some kind of institution, and I either work here or am studying here, either way it's where I spend my time. There's a lot of Life Training people here, and yoga people. First I go to a kind of arena, and take my place in the stands near the front. Sue is nearby and we say something to each other, I don't know what's going on out in the arena itself. Shortly it seems to be lunch hour, and everybody breaks up and goes places. All very casual, people just drift away. I stand talking to somebody for a few minutes. Then I'm at a kind of concrete ramp-affair, like you might find in a parking lot. The corner of the ramp goes up and around, and the sides are open from about shoulder height so you see sunlight and trees and all. There are quite a few people about, including Sue, and I tell her about a conversation I just had with somebody, and I tell her his name, which she finds hard to believe, but I insist once or twice,, and then start to say, ""You know, the guy who used to work with you"", but stop short because I realize that it was Bill Wold instead of who I said after all. I'm embarrassed but amused and I tell Sue I've remembered that the person I'd said was wrong, but I'd tell her later who it was. So I settle down on the floor with a blanket or a mat of some kind, and set it up just under the turn of the ramp where the upper part creates a real deep slant to the lower part, and I'm going to do some exercises. I'm not sure I meant to at first, but after I get settled I just think I'll try sitting up and reaching for the upper-thing, since it's so close. I'm lying so that I'm on a slant, with my head down. So as I reach up, I come up easily enough, hands straight out, but they have to bend soon because of the wall. Then back down again, hard but I can do it. I continue to do this for quite a while, and one or another people come to talk to me, including George, whom I'd rather not see because I don't want him to watch me do this. I'm not doing it to ""work out"" anyway, but for fun and to see how long I can. George, having seen me do this, decides to set up some kind of an exercise in the vicinity, which involves him being behind a curtain, and the other people laid out in rows that remind me of streets. I at first think I'm taking part in this but am not very enthusiastic. Then I see by the clock (that I never noticed before) that it's 1.10 and my lunch hour's over anyway. I start to pick up my things and go."
"157"	"(4/20/87)"	"There's a kind of war or rebellion going on at work, and management has some of the employees working for them, but not many are morally behind them. I'm in a small office - just came there to help or take over for another girl, we're going through some files and sorting things. There's a couple of girls from ""the other side"" crouched behind a desk across the room shooting arrows at us. We're pretty nonchalant - mostly these people can't hit you for beans, and the risk is small (though present!) so you just do your thing and don't bother about ducking, it's not as though you don't know what they're going to do. The girl I'm with is going through papers on my right, and she says she needs to leave early, there's something she needs to go home for, will I mind taking over for her? I say no, that's fine, I don't have much to do anyway. But this arrow-business is becoming a nuisance, and you know all I really need to do is just go and kick the desk over on 'em - so I do that. Takes a couple of tries but it goes over - it's a regular heavy old gray one, and one of the girls is pinned under it. Don't know if she's hurt or not. The other one comes out from behind and says, look, I hope you don't resent this too much, I'm just doing this because I have to, I don't really want to hurt you. (She has long hair, sort of pretty, ""nice"" - reminds me of Bailey Quarters.) I say to her, that's okay, actually I'm just worried about the rest of your life. She considers that - yeah, she says, you're right; I don't know if I really want to hurt anybody at all. I say I don't know if I could actually hurt another person myself."
"158"	"(4/20/87)"	"I'm under the control of a couple of guys, one blonde, one dark-haired. The blonde is in charge, more or less but the other is his henchman. [I don't know what they want with me but I've been their prisoner not very long, in a house.] They don't have weapons but think I can't resist them. I get hold of a long square stick/pole and brain the darker one with it - he didn't think I could do it and all but laughed at me. It was kind of fun and I sort of want to hit him again but I need to get out before he wakes up. The blonde guy comes with me. We get in a car, back seat, somebody else driving."
"159"	"(4/21/87)"	"I'm sitting at a vanity table trying to put on my mascara in a hurry - I thought I'd finished all the makeup but when I went out and saw myself in a mirror I hadn't done it, so I'm here - I do a stroke, and get it on my eyelid. Several spots. I rub one, make a smudge; I don't have my stick or Q-Tips, so I frantically look for something to rub with and it doesn't work very well - I can't get the Kleenex to work. I'm panicking. Finally I go out again. [Kelly's around somewhere.] I'm outside with Lorren and some other people - we're getting ready to go somewhere, we're next to a car. I'm gonna try the mascara again. I'm still nervous - I drop the wand, and juggle it, and it ends up stuck between the armhole of my white sweater-vest and my white shirt. I'm thoroughly overwrought now and just collapse in tears. Nobody knows why I'm so depressed but they're cautious. Somebody leaves, I think, and Lorren and I go back inside. There's somebody else here, 2 men. Some other guys come to take us (all) some place but I just can't go. Lorren stays with me."
"160"	"(4/25/87)"	"I've brought Tree, who is elderly and not well, ""home"" - as if we've been staying out in the country somewhere - as well as 3 baby possums. I'm looking at a picture book of nursery rhymes and (fairy tales, I guess) - it's quite large, with color pictures. The babies and Tree are perched at the top as if they're tucked between pages, and I'm turning them, to find some story with possums in it (or are they foxes?) where the babies can live. And one for Tree, so I can give him a nice home to retire in. I'm trying not to think about that - it's too painful. I don't want to let him go, don't want to send him away. And I say to myself, ""he's only 12 years old! He could live a long time yet!"" Cats can get to be 16 or older - that's another 4 years, maybe. A couple of other people are with me and we're running from some bad guys, gangsters, in a place like a warehouse, with barrels and bundles in it. They're going to come through the door and it looks like we can't get out but by the time they come through we've got up to the ceiling and through a trapdoor or something into the room above and we're away."
"161"	"(4/25/87)"	"A young man calls me on the phone, he's from the SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM and I've met him casually at an event or party I had once, at some park or school or church or somewhere. He's telling me that we're going to have a visit from a King Estanzia and this is partly an invitation to come, but also he wants to know how or if they can get to use the place I had the party at. I tell him what there is to say about that and ask him who is this Estanzia that I should be so impressed with him - what's he like? what's he done? The guy doesn't answer me, and I rephrase the question, but he still doesn't, and I wonder have I offended him so bad, or has he already hung up, and I just don't realize it? [As I gradually wake up I don't have it in my hand, so I couldn't have been talking to anybody.]"
"162"	"(4/28/87)"	"I'm working in a courtroom - it's big, open, has lots of people in it, including George - who still teaches yoga too. My job is more or less clinical, but I'm pretty much indispensable - I do all sorts of things and make myself useful. Some of the people here are caricatures - there's a sort of hostile Groucho Marx, and pompous uniformed ""official""-types (like from Ruritania or somewhere). Something needs to be solved, or someone needs to be captured, and the only thing for it is to go out there and do it. Nobody else will, so I'm gonna go myself. I have some adventures, hunting up and down, through the city. Somewhere I'm joined by (or I join) Roger Moore and another girl, blonde, a friend of mine. We've captured a woman who's supposed to be involved in this thing, but it turns out she's been a victim herself. We're going to have to spend the night together, and we get very chummy. In fact we all end up having sex. Now, Roger has so far considered me more like a little sister, but I'm glad he's changed his mind. There's a brief discussion about condoms, and somebody does have some - it crosses my mind to be sure he changes them from one to another of us. As we start to undress, I end up getting closest to him, and rather feel I've taken over, which is okay with me. In other scenes, I run into a girl I know but don't like much - she's short and funny-looking (and I can't remember where I know her from) - she says she's glad to see me, we don't see each other much. The 1st of these times is in a building, the 2nd is outdoors - I'm trying to keep up with some people walking and she comes to stroll beside me. I'd like to get away from her. Eventually, we get back to the courtroom, the blonde girl and I - and we turn the place on its ear. We expose the ringleaders of the gang, which includes Groucho, and discover the crucial evidence at the top of one of the giant windows. It has Venetian blinds - somebody has to climb to the top and get whatever it is. Big show. All the perpetrators get hauled off to jail, protesting and threatening, and things get quiet again. Now it's all over, I look back and see it's been 3 weeks since all this started. ""Tree weeks"", I say, ""that took 3 whole weeks."" As if I'm amazed."
"163"	"(5/1/87)"	"I'm in a studio with a guy I know pretty well and a couple of other people (one's a woman, all young). He's a photographer or something and this is a kind of hidden place where they can do their own work, to experiment and try stuff out, and play. I'm a guest. Actually I've been here before, my px brought me here some time ago. He thought of it as a kind of crash pad. Now I see there's an organized group here and I'm a little sheepish about it. I don't want to tell them because they think hardly anybody knows about this place, and I don't want to disappoint them. It's morning - I think we've spent the night here."
"164"	"(5/1/87)"	"I'm visiting out of town and am with Brad and An important person and somebody else, a woman. We're at a back yard, very large, it's dark and there's not much light - low to the ground, diffused, a bit eerie. B and R have crossed the yard to the back fence where there's a shed and I suppose the trash cans. They're working away at something quite happily. Don't know yet what they're doing but they'll be there a while and I need to go back there to be with them. I'm reluctant, because it's so far and dark - there's quite a few trees, and I've been threatened with kidnapping [I don't know why] , and I'm scared to be alone. Just the same I start across, and right away someone starts coming after me - I don't know where he's actually come from but he's dark - can't see what he really looks like - trench coat and hat I think. I can dodge him but I don't think I can outrun him all the way to the back of the yard. I start yelling. Brad and An important person can't hear me - it's too far. I yell louder and louder and I'm afraid they'll never hear me, but finally they do. There's a fence back there, too, and I've got to get all the way to the right corner where the gate is, so it's even farther. But the others come running now and chase the guy - there are other people coming too, kind of like a hue and cry. I get comforted by the woman."
"165"	"(5/2/87)"	"I'm at a fair-sort-of, very festive, clean place, lots of trees and light, but at a building like a church, school, something with grounds and passages. More an Artfest crowd, Sunday-dressed, well-behaved. There's a blonde guy and his wife interested in my necklace, slightly aggressive but not wanting to be overt about it - the wife walks off a bit to look at something else, I think so the guy can try to sweet-talk me out of it by himself. He is pretty good-looking in a yuppie sort of way, they're a nice pair. [quote note:] I take it out of its bag and it came apart - it's made [""long?""] like Tom's but bigger. [I don't know what that means now except that the pendant was made to come apart.]"
"166"	"(5/2/87)"	"I'm on a bus with a friend, very late at night or early in the morning, we've arrived at a bus termina and we're stuck at the diner - the only place open - with no transportation. She's called her boyfriend, who's come to ""rescue"" us, we've really had it, tired, draggy after the long ride - he takes us in hand, his poor little waifs - buys us breakfast. (He looks like Richard Masur.) Buncha food, bacon and eggs and that, piled up on those plates - he passes them magnanimously. I have to move some tables around in this place so I can eat facing away from the other customers. Coupla groups like families with kids and I can't quite fit in the middle. There was hardly anybody here at first, but lots more people are coming in."
"167"	"(5/2/87)"	"I'm with my brother, at a fair coming up to the zoo building. There are some Highland-games sorts of things going on behind, I can see, and I thought my borther would want to see but we go on in. There are several cute furry animals we look at, and I want to get quite close, but they're pretty vicious and they want to bite me. The keeper has to keep a good hold on them."
"168"	"(5/3/87)"	"I'm in England visiting (or not - maybe I'll stay) and have been staying with my brother and somebody, who's just left for a weekend or something and My brother's going home. He doesn't really want to but it's got to do with his health or something, he has to. He's taking me to the train/underground/something stop, I'm going further north to visit a friend and we're running late. He has to be leaving right away himself - he says ""Hard to believe, at (8.45?) in the morning I'll be back home"". I realize suddenly he can keep my cat for me - that'll be such a good idea. He says well, maybe - you don't mean permanently do you? I say, well no, of course I'll just be here a while. But maybe not. I'd like to be able to stay. Now we've gotten to the place for me to get the train - it's dark and there's nobody around. I was supposed to be there at 8-something - .35 or .45, and it's 9 now straight up. For a minute we hope the train's late but surely it's been and gone and what will I do now? He can't stay, I may just have to stay here instead for the weekend. Won't kill me. Earlier (or I got north anyhow) - I'm with the girl I'm visiting - she's a teenager, just going off to school soon. She talks about where she's going to go and I suggest she check out Cambridge and Oxford and those places - she seems to have the idea that those places are only for well-off men and not just anybody. I say they're not and she might as well go somewhere really good if she can. We also talk about her having a car and seeing it repaired - I have a suggestion, something I learned from my px, about the exhaust system? She's a bit excited about having a car of her own, and being able to go around where she wants to."
"169"	"(5/3/87)"	"I'm walking in a mall and there's a store that sells silver and I think I'll duck in and look at silver flatware but at first I don't see any and it all seems to be big stuff so I go out and around again. The store is sort of self-contained and has 2 or 3 entrances, so I can go around it and look in the windows and all. I get to the other side and see the room with the flatware is over here. Besides, there's a man following me (or he sure looks like it) and I want to get someplace else, somewhere with people. I go in, see some stuff and see that this outer room is only samples and the main collection's in the next room - they probably have everything. It's a big room with lots and lots of styles and their prices are good."
"170"	"(5/4/87)"	"A guy I'm with behaving as if I'm ""pursuing"" him, when I just like having his company. We're riding in a car first, I think, then walking down a hall/mall, and he says he's going a different way but he doesn't get very far before we're both interested in some person or thing on the way. He's a nice guy but reluctant to invest himself."
"171"	"(5/9/87)"	"There's some sort of fair going on and I'm returning from somewhere, coming up on it from behind - it's late, dark, I think they're trying to close down. Still a lot of people here, though, looking at examples of international crafts. I can't get through going up into the tents, so I go around back till I have to go through one with lots of racks of Japanese clothes in. There are long coats, where a sign says ""Happi Coats"" - I don't think that's right for them - and some shorter ones. I go through and up some stairs - there's 2 levels in here - and out. (Same place, yes?) Sue is interviewing someone on cable TV, and members of the LT community are doing the support jobs, doing the camera, etc. - I'm asked to take over when someone else needs to leave, he or she's just put the camera down and I'm not sure what to do with it. It's actually very like a shotgun mike, it has a conical end on it and you just sort of hold it out there, but I'm having lots of trouble keeping it steady and I can't tell what I'm actually ""hitting"" with it. I'm picturing this whole interview being shown from side to side and pictures of their feet. Finally when I think it's stable they get up to end the interview and move. And I don't know how to shut it off, either."
"172"	"(5/9/87)"	"I'm working in Circulation and just about to leave - this place is sort of a cross between a fair and a theater and a library, and there's a lot of people bustling out there. The desk is busy. One of my co-workers comes in the back office where I am, with (Alma?) and says we've got a money problem - something hasn't come out right about yesterday's fine money - we investigate and pretty soon find the problem. Yesterday was actually okay, but somebody's counted the first 5 for today without changing dates, making yesterday's look wrong. We're all relieved, and I can go home now."
"173"	"(5/9/87)"	"There's a ""Dating Game"" TV show - the 3 contestants are nice young girls, all quite different. One's black, I'm not sure if the other 2 are both white, but they all work at pretty ordinary jobs and have pretty ordinary lives. This game has a new twist: of the 3 guys they each get to pick from, there's one ""ringer"" - a blonde, gorgeous hunk that none of them would probably connect with in real life (he looks rather like George Michael, but less nasty) - and he gets to be in each group. If any of the girls picks him they get an extra prize."
"174"	"(5/23/87)"	"I'm with Jonathan Richman (who looks more like Bob Geldof), arriving at his house for a visit. I don't know him very well but we're striking up a friendship, and since I'm in England he's brought me to see/meet his wife (have I already met her?). He pulled up to the back door and we've gotten out and I'm looking at the back yard, which is huge. It's not so big a place that you can't see anything else; the lawn goes on for a long time but there are other houses and streets and buildings to be seen. And the house itself is situated on a street, rather a nice one. The house is old, fairly large, and 2 or 3 stories, with a large set of steps up to the back door. Not a big porch, though. We go up and he unlocks the door, and we go into the kitchen, then through to the front living room. We pass the stairs. Jonathan is talking about 2 or 3 things, and I start to ask if his wife is upstairs, but then I notice the furniture and open my mouth to mention that. This house is not fancy, by a long shot - it's in good repair, I expect, but not fixed up at all; the furniture is as old as the house practically, and threadbare. He's got what he needs, I guess, and I know he's happy here, satisfied, but it is a little sad-looking. Still it's not grubby or smelly or unpleasant. I start to say something, then stop - he says ""What?"" and I say pretty much the above, like for a minute I was thinking this wasn't very fancy for a rock star, then I'd thought, well, he hasn't been that famous for very long, after all, and just buying the house itself was a pretty big deal. I guess if he wants to fix up the furniture, he'll do it sometime. Meanwhile I'm being made quite comfortable here myself, and I appreciate it. I'm sitting on the couch when some other visitors come - a couple who are friends and a guy who's one of Jonathan's longtime buddies - since they were kids - they come in and sit and chat. The buddy is an inveterate storyteller and he makes very cheery conversation, and they ask me how long I'm staying and how I like it, all that stuff. (I'm sort of in the middle of my trip - I hope I have this much fun for the rest of it.) I'm looking out the window at the street scene, and there are various people out there including this older man who was here earlier - he's a bit dotty, tallish, wears a baggy raincoat, matching hat, sort of wild hair. He's just the sort of dotty that he comes up and makes strange conversation but doesn't get loud or difficult. He's out there talking to some kids. It's a lovely quiet and slow summer afternoon, nobody has anything pressing to do, people are out strolling and talking. I have to leave now, and I wish I could stay and talk longer, especially to the old-buddy fellow, he's a lot of fun and seems to like me. But I make my good-byes, and go out the front door, and drive down the street looking around at the houses and trees and things on the way."
"175"	"(5/24/87)"	"I'm supposed to be at an exercise class but I'm late and I also have a doctor's appointment - I think I can still get in on the class, though - it's 9.30 now and the doctor probably won't be ready right on time. But it's cutting it awfully fine. I've been into the gym changing room and back out to my car already, now I'm changing my mind and I'm going to pull on my leotard here in the car. It'll be awkward but I think I can do it. But no, really I think I'll be in a mess if I do that, I'd better not. I go to the doctor's office and Sandie is standing on the porch. She's a bit serious about something. [We interact, but I don't remember it now.]"
"176"	"(5/24/87)"	"I'm with Tom Selleck; we've been somewhere together on some sort of adventure, and come back to town successful and triumphant - even so, it's just us and our other companion (a dark-haired girl, like Barbara Parkins - she's somebody we rescued or picked up along the way.) - whatever we did, nobody knows about it yet, we're just getting back onto the streets and getting ready to go back to normal, I guess. ""Barbara"" goes off a bit and I can speak to Tom alone. He's wearing a black feather mask like the ones we saw at the Faire. We hug, relieved and tired and satisfied, and I say ""I love you"", inadvertently. He lets go and draws away just a little, looking askance. I put my hands on his face and say, look it's okay, I don't mean anything bad - just listen to me: show me the truth on your face, let me see the real you, and I'll tell you the truth: I do love you and I'm glad we were together. (I am feeling affectionate and also sure and grounded.) I'm entering the school auditorium, there's an aisle dividing the main floor from the balcony (kind of like the Movie theater, but nicer), and I see the beige/tan fabric on the walls and seats, it matches the carpet even. I usually sit in the balcony, but this time I think I'll try turning right instead and I go down the main floor - which steps down - and I see Cynthia and Linda sitting behind her, one side. So they wave and say hello and I go sit next to Cynthia. They're glad to see me."
"177"	"(5/24/87)"	"I'm at a drive-in movie theater, big place, huge screen. We're all out of the car, visiting or doing something else - the movie isn't running anyway. It's been raining. There's a movie actor here, over at the office or whatever that is in the middle, down near the screen, he's doing a personal appearance. He seems to be a real nice guy, I'd like to get to know him. I'm wondering if I can. There's a dog here, too (I don't know if he's mine or not, black, biggish, nice dog, and he's got to come home with us, after having been somewhere for something. And he's gotten rained on. I'm worried it'll rain again and he'll get even wetter and then we'll have to drive back with him all a mess in the car. I get in the car for a minute, then coming back out I encounter a stinging insect which I'm not too pleased about. I wonder if I just got stung myself (I don't feel any pain on my skin), and if he'll be back to plague us on the way home. Actually the car's not in a good position, too close to another one, and I want to move it. So I push it. Somebody thinks I can't do it by myself, in the mud and all with other cars to run into, but it's really very easy. Just push, it goes, I turn the wheel, pull the handbrake to stop it. I got it maneuvered back into position very easily."
"178"	"(6/19/87)"	"I'm getting to know a family who live next door in a house - I live in an apartment or condo with Dad and my Stepmother. There are several kids, teenagers and a little older, all pretty nice and we're palling around. We go somewhere, it's afternoon and we're just walking around, and we pass by something that I climb on like a little pile of rocks or something. We're talking away and having a good time. We get back to their house and there's kittens - not only the fuzzy, frisky size, but newborns too, lots of kittens - we visit them for a while. We go and sit, me and the girl, while one brother goes off to play baseball or something - these are active kids, they move around a lot. We talk about dinner but never get up to do anything about it. I talk to the oldest boy quite a lot, we seem to have a lot in common and he likes me, rather. I go on back to my apartment and see my family for a minute, then go on to my room. This room is big and white - everything is very arty, with clean spare lines, sliding doors, everything Design. Before I even get settled in, the boy from next door calls me on the phone - it's a wall phone with a lot of buttons - and he says he's just thought, why don't we go out somewhere? And I say, ""When?"" and he says ""Right now"" - I say, well, uh, um, I guess so - he seems pleased as hell, like he'd been working up to this and now it's actually true. And I'm thinking, well, now I've got a date with this kid - what am I gonna do? This is ridiculous - I don't even have anything to wear - he's gonna be dressed up [I don't know how I know that] and I don't have anything nice, I don't think. I figure I've got maybe 5 minutes before he gets here - I want to call my parents but I can't think what their extension is - I punch 2 numbers at random, thinking I might get lucky, but I get Winfred in the print shop, and I say ""wrong number"" and hang up - I guess I'll give that up and go look at clothes. As I get to the other side of the room where the ""closet"" is, next to the door, a passel of people come in. They're older, middleaged mostly, and they've come sort of as a tour group, but I know some of them. They want to see me, and hover around and get in my way and won't let me try things on. A couple of them ask how I feel and say I don't look well, suspiciously, as though they suspect I'm not taking care of myself. I tell them I'm ok, but I'm a little worried about what they mean - though not as worried as I am about getting dressed for this date. He's gonna be here any minute and I haven't so much as combed my hair, or anything. Another scene, possibly in the previous dream but I'm not sure: I'm on the toilet, and finish a roll of toilet paper - the next one I take out seems a little different but I don't know how. Two people come in wanting toilet paper since they're also out, but they don't want this because it's smaller, too narrow. I look at it and see that it is, about 3/4 the size of a normal roll. Doesn't bother me any (though I do consider that the manufacturer has increased his profit at our expense), and I wonder what the others (one of them is Heidi) intend to do without any."
"179"	"(6/20/87)"	"I'm with my brother at a place like a hotel with a race track, and he wants to practice driving. It's rainy and getting dark. We walk over to the place where the cars are and we meet a couple of old friends from years ago. They're all going to get together later. My brother drives off, one of the other guys goes ahead, and the other guy and I decide to mosey back to the hotel. [I'm unsure if I wanted to go somewhere else or get my stuff out of my car and go in.] Just before we get there I realize he's got my car key. I'm very concerned about this and I wonder if I should go flag him down in the car or not. First I go back across the parking lot to look on the ground for it. No dice, and it's gonna start raining. Just about the time I start off to flag him down, I find the key in my purse. I'm relieved. Also: I'm with a girlfriend (we're both quite young, aren't we?), having left my house walking through the neighborhood, and we pass by this guy's house. He lives here, we think alone, and he's pretty good-looking. (Dark hair, 30's, well-built.) His door is open, and we're not sure if he's home, but we take it into our heads to look after his plants. We come on in, looking round a bit, and get to watering and futzing with the plants - he's got a lot, hanging and on stands and things, in pots. Nice place, eclectic, lots of high ceiling and air in, interesting shadows. He's here, actually, but doesn't mind what we're doing - he's something like a writer and not very social, but not unfriendly either. Doesn't pay us a lot of mind. But his plants do need attention. While we're here, a woman comes in, around his age, nice looking - surprised to see us here. I don't know her, but I think she may be his girlfriend, and I hope she doesn't think we shouldn't be here. She may think this is her job. I'm uncomfortable and I expect we should go."
"180"	"(6/27/87)"	"I'm with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who I keep calling Conan - he's driving me back from somewhere and I talk him into going to pick up Melanie, who's at a house somewhere in a neat neighborhood, and she's like spent the night with this unsavoury guy who may do her some harm, I think. So we get there - actually I think he knows the guy, or something, and goes in. Melanie comes out, I'm not sure she comes out the door, does she sort of ""escape"" out a window or something? Anyway, she gets to the truck and I'm rather nervous about being here and want to get away quick and Conan isn't coming out. I don't feel right about leaving him but I drive us off, and it's getting dark and (raining?). Actually now that we're on the road there's a 3rd person with us, another woman - we're on a big road, close to where we're going, with 3 lanes or so each way, and lotsa traffic, and the road being torn up. I'm not having that easy a time handling this truck, and what with the slick road it skids and turns over on its side. We're not hurt, but we gotta get out and away from the traffic - we scramble to the front and I can see all these other cars coming and I'm terrified they're going to crash into us and pile up several, right on top of us. We're scrambling over the piled-up road and clamber over into the big ditch by the side of the road. Geez what a relief. But now we gotta be rescued from the ditch. We watch for a while and people come with emergency cars and stuff. Then we go over to the left side (backward, that is) where there's a bit of ledge we can climb up on and stand close to the top. Some people come there to help - turn out to be somebody I know (LT? SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM?), so we stand and talk while we're waiting for someone to pull us out."
"181"	"(7/2/87)"	"I'm going to see a preview of a play or maybe poetry reading or something, very small potatoes, in a small theater that's part of some other institution. I've been invited to come for free by Jon, who's instrumental in getting this thing put on, he may have even written some of it. I've come up the hall to where the door is, and I say hi to Jon, who's also just come up and is waiting for his wife, to bring some things. She comes up with this huge load of stuff, even a bouquet of roses sticking up over her face. I make some joke about her having to carry all this stuff, but nobody notices. The roses are to go right here at the entrance. Another person I know, Rory, comes up (I haven't seen her in a long time and she sure looks different) and we all exchange greetings. Jon offers us each a rose (he's all dressed up in a tux, by the way) and as I take it I realize it isn't real, it's wax or something. They do smell, and I put it to my nose and then for a laugh I take a bite of it. I'm not really sure quite what it's made of, after all. It tastes almost as if it were meant to be eaten. I believe I'll take another bite, but I'll wait till Paula can't see me so she won't think I don't care about my pretty rose. So Rory and I go on inside. There doesn't seem to be anyone taking tickets even if we had any, but we wanted to make sure. This is certainly is a tiny place, probably 20 people across by maybe 15 down, tops. Behind the rows is a little gift shop, I guess for the whole building, not just the theater. Rory looks at some stuff there and I look at something just outside its entrance. Someone does come to take tickets, I guess he just stepped out. I wonder if we'll have to explain we've been invited for free."
"182"	"(7/2/87)"	"Mom and I are at a fair or something and leaving. It's an old-time sort of thing, very ethnic, and we come past a pastry booth where they're selling things like kolaches, but they're not flat, they're like little pastry tulips, most of them, and have a lot of different fillings, savoury or sweet, and have a different name [which I've forgotten] . All these women are behind the counters, dressed in their old-country costumes and talking loudly in their old-country accents. I didn't think Mom would want to stop at all, but she does, and I didn't think she'd want the sweet ones, but she does, and we make our way to the right-hand counter. The booth is all wood, with a rooflet and darkish. The place is open, and make L-shape with an extra corner: The meat and vegetable fillings on the left and the fruit fillings on the right. We go over to the right and have a look, then turn to the center where the actual counter is [in the diagram above, the upper right corner] , and talk to the blonde woman there. She has a sharp voice, all business. I look at the fruit fillings; I can see blueberries, all plump and round. Back left I can see the nice little tulip-shapes and some kind of meat fillings."
"183"	"(7/2/87)"	"I'm in another theater, a big one, not many people here, and I'm with a group. We're sitting down close to the front, center, and somebody asks us to move. I don't know why, but we do move to the back, where there's some other things, like an opening into a large hallway with pinball and video machines. There's a ledge where some of the older ones of us sit down, and I'm not real happy standing, so I take a spot there too. The show hasn't started, won't for a while yet - this isn't entertainment we've come for, but something maybe political or social, something dramatic - I think we're planning to ""do"" something ourselves and that's why there's this tension, a real sober undercurrent among us; I don't know about the other people here. Nobody's talking about it."
"184"	"(7/2/87)"	"I'm in a garage with a girlfriend; we've just been out somewhere and are going back through town, stopping here to get the car worked on or something, and we're still in very jolly spirits (it was a fun outing) and poking around in this garage. She's looking out the window at the street and turns back to tell me she's just seen this good-looking guy that I was drooling over at wherever-we've-been, go into a store across the street! She teases me about it, saying I should go talk to him, and I'm thinking about it. In the meantime [something we do causes a big oil spill on the floor of the garage, and the men who work here come back from outside and are not happy about it.] Still, we're very lighthearted and girlish, giggling over the boy."
"185"	"(7/2/87)"	"I've been at a large glamorous motel, it's night, the place is all lit up and glittery, festive. [Something dramatic happens, and I end up leaving the scene in a hurry in a van with somebody else, being driven by a young boy.] We seem to be driving away from the motel, but it's much bigger than I thought, and the buildings keep on looking alike as we drive through. We've already turned right twice. The buildings are less glamorous now, but you'd suppose they would be. We make another right turn, and come into another neighborhood, and drive along a fence which is down an alley; or at least the fence is between two blocks of houses back-to-back; it doesn't seem like an alley, really. We come to where the fence stops, and get out. For some reason we're reluctant to go to the other side of the fence, because we're not sure what's there. So we walk around rather than take the van. On the other side it's daylight. It looks just like the side we were on, houses and all just the way it should be, but it's daylight instead of night. (Actually it's not pitch dark anyway - you might think of it as more dawn, you can see a bit - but not dusk, it's definitely been night.) We look back again to see, and by George it's still night over there, and day here. There's something suspicious about this and uncomfortable, like this daylight is not the way it's supposed to be, and we're going to get into big trouble if we stay here."
"186"	"(7/3/87)"	"I'm married to somebody, living in a house with kids (I guess they're mine) - fairly ordinary small house, Forties, Fifties maybe, not in great repair; I think there's maybe one of the kids home, otherwise just me. Right now I'm straightening some things up, I've got some old junk out to clean up or throw out, and it's cold in here, so I go look at the thermostat. It's on the wall next to a table [like mine really is] and it's coming apart. It's not even easy to read - parts of it are hanging down. I fiddle with it some and think maybe it's gone for good; I think I can read the temperature on it and it's set okay but is it really working? I'm not sure I can read what it really is. While I'm over there I knock a box of hair combs off the table onto the floor and one of them breaks. I see it between the table and the wall, and the ornaments came off and are lying face down - one of them as I pick it up looks like a dead spider and I drop it, then I reach for another bit that's definitely a feather and I realize that it was only a butterfly made of feathers. So I pick that up, and the comb, and the rest of 'em - they're all that plastic tortoise-shell stuff. I'm also taking some old bits of things with gunk all over them out of a box to un-muck, and these things I've got now are covered with wax like somebody burned candles in them. I can pull it all out at once - turns out they're some kind of levellers for furniture. We can maybe use them. I've also got quite a lump of wax/gunk here, kind of interesting. While I'm near it, I see a shape scurrying along the wall. I just know it's a rat or something equally nasty. I throw the lump of gunk at it (after moving chairs and stuff out of the way) and I may have hit it but didn't do it any damage - it scurries further to an open door that leads into the attic. So that's where it came from. It's gone out of sight, but reappears with a baby in its mouth. Now I can see it's not a rat but a possum [however, in the dream it really didn't look like one, it looked more like a prairie dog - I just called it a possum] , not so dangerous but I still don't want it running around my house, especially not depositing babies. It freezes when it sees me, and I clap and shout to scare it. It jumps and jostles the opposite door, which leads into one of the boys' rooms. This is no great help but I don't know what else to do right now. In fact, people are starting to come in now - my husband's home, several friends are coming for dinner, kids home from school. I'm feeling up now, this is fun, cares are on the back burner, I'm chatting with a girlfriend in the kitchen - small kitchen, small house, but we're comfortable. My husband is nearby, telling stories and jokes, I'm feeling very affectionate toward him but we do have our differences. He's saying something about me, that he thinks is funny, about me being incompetent or something, and I think it's not only untrue but offensive. I look over to him and say ""I'm what?"" and he looks like, ""heh-heh, isn't she cute""; I go over and face him and he says ""I was only making a joke"" and I get fed up and decide to leave. I'm tired of this kind of thing, it happens too much and I'm just not going to stand for it. Maybe I'll leave for good - right now I just believe I'll go out and have a good time - find a friend, have a drink, do my own thing. By coincidence, a woman I know is just passing and I hitch a ride with her. She's on her way somewhere but doesn't mind dropping me off - maybe Barbara will be home, and I'll stay there, or Linda. While we're driving along, we chat, and I'm still trying hard to remember the name of the blonde actress who used to do everything on TV in the 60's. I keep coming up with Madelyn Rhue, but that's wrong, and another name, but the right one won't come. We drive around a building that has a few shops in it, on the street; the corner one has a stucco front and a window above the main window and the door, and there's what I take to be a plaster ornament above the main window. It's a cat, a purple and white one - not dark purple, or quite lavender, but noticeable when you look. Only it's stuck on sideways, as if the wall was the cat's floor. However, now I can see the cat is real, a live, breathing cat sitting casually on the wall like nothing was unusual. It moves, it licks its paw, just like normal. I strain out the car to peer at it, and call to my friend, you've got to see this! So she looks, and we don't know what to make of it, and we go on. We come to a sort of tiny, sad-looking laundromat next to a matching sort-of 7-11 and stop next to an open vehicle with two men in it. One of them gets out and as he passes my side, he casually reaches in and lifts out a little round purse by its shoulder strap, which has been lying on the dashboard, and it's easily reached by the very front of the window, because the window's been broken out. I'm startled, and I say ""Wait! That purse, put that back!"" (or words to that effect) and my friend says ""What?"" and I ask her if that isn't her purse (she hadn't been watching), and tell her what he did. He's gone on into the laundromat and I get out and start after him and point at the car and say something to the other man (like, ""Isn't that your friend and didn't I just see him take that purse?"") and he starts to back the car out while the first one runs out and down the street. I'm verbally calling out descriptions of them and the car - it's a lot like a VW Thing or some form of Jeep but I can't see what for all the numbers painted on the back. I'm not even sure I can remember the license # for all the other stuff. I run behind and grab onto the back to get a closer look, then jump off. We go into the 7-11 thing, where they've seen all this and we're going to call the police. But suddenly the first guy (darkish, maybe Mexican, with a mustache) (the other had been bigger and handsomer, Caucasian with brown hair, looked pissed off while the first one had been swaggering and smug - both wore light short-sleeved shirts, the Caucasian one's a knit polo) comes bursting into the place and now he's got a gun, a revolver. I'm pretty shaken, but I get down behind a table and pull it up in front of me. He definitely wants to shoot me, that's what he's come back for, he's real mad. I say ""Do you really mean to kill me just for a little purse that probably didn't have anything in it anyway?"" I'm getting a real sober feeling that I'm about to get actually shot, maybe killed, and I sure don't like it but I'm determined not to panic. I'd rather get shot deliberately, knowing what's happening, than to panic and be desperately scared too."
"187"	"(7/4/87)"	"At Faire for some other reason, ran into Dara - I forgot she'd be here for a workshop of some kind, don't know what, attending with a friend I don't know. They collar me to talk, they're on a lunch break. I explain what I'm looking for, they can't help. I need to leave soon. Before I can go, I get stopped by another person I know, [can't place her for sure - some Sandra, some Suzann] a blonde girl, who cuddles up against me as we sit with some other people watching a sort of training/educational film on a screen. Actually it's kind of interesting, and it's comfortable here, I can't stay long, though. I get to thinking about the trip and how tiring it will be - I hope I don't have to spend my whole vacation recovering from the trip up and then spoil it with the trip down. I'm thinking, maybe I could go up in stages - stay overnight between legs, or something. How would that be? I'll investigate it. This girl and I are quite comfortable, she keeps leaning into me and we also hold hands. I really like this, I appreciate the affection. But I'm not entirely comfortable, and I do have to go now the film's over."
"188"	"(7/4/87)"	"I'm at the Faire site, either midweek or after closing (though the sun's out) - everybody's gone and all the booths are empty. [It looks different, of course.] There are some SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people around, doing their thing, still in costume. One of them has videotaped something during the day, I think a minor event of theirs, when there were plenty of people about - all of them were in costume, I notice - just like a real fair. I look around on the screen for myself, but I'm not in it. It's interesting to look at the same scene you're looking at right now, only with people, then without, then with, then without. They'd as soon I stayed and played with them, but I have to be on my way. I brought Tree with me and I have to fetch him. [I can't remember if he was in a carrier and got out, or had been out all along.] I keep calling ""Tree!"" and I'm getting worried. But now I do hear him, somewhere. I call some more and I think I hear him from under this vehicle here that's under an open shelter. Then I hear catfight noises, and I break it up only to find it's not Tree after all, but a big fluffy dark-gray-striped cat who's with a friend, worrying a koala bear, a small one. Well! The gray cat's pretty mad, but he knows not to mess with me, and takes off shortly. This still leaves me not knowing what to do with this koala bear, and I've got to find Tree."
"189"	"(8/1/87)"	"I'm on a city street, walking, there are lots of people around, I know at least some of them, that is to say I live here and am a part of this place, I belong here. It's daytime but the sun's not terribly bright - a workday. From somewhere comes a fire alarm, sounds like the one at work, and everybody starts moving to certain places, as though it's backwards and you respond to this signal by going underground rather than outside. There's no fear, everybody seems to know or assume it's a fire drill [and that's what it's called, too - there's no assumption that it's anything else, like bombs] . The place I'm going to is at a corner, and looks like a drain opening. I'm not sure exactly what to do, but Kay is right in front of me and she says we go down here. I'm thinking surely a person can't get into that, but as I get closer I see it's bigger than I thought. Still it looks awfully cramped, and I'm not looking forward to squeezing into it and maybe hurting myself, but Kay just steps into it and goes down like she's walking on a staircase. By George, that's what it is, and it's even big enough for more than one person. [I'm not conscious of the opening actually getting bigger, but surely it must be - it looked so very different from time to time as I approached.] Now we're part of a group steadily moving down the stairs to what looks like an Underground station. Kay goes off somewhere else, but I'm staying here in the near vicinity, and there are 3 or 4 guys sitting together in a sort of small auditorium, near the back. There's nothing actually going on in here, just people sitting through the fire drill, and I chat a bit with these guys. They're maybe in their twenties, buddies - I'm not entirely comfortable with them, they don't altogether want me in their group, but I don't want to go off anywhere by myself. We talk about getting something to eat - there's a sort of kitchen nearby, and the idea is something like (pizza?), maybe we could get that together. But I'm not sure, maybe I should get some fruit instead. I get up and I'm actually thinking about going up outside. [The idea is like there's a fruit-cart out there, or something - it's a bit mixed up with my basket of fruit on the counter. And this in spite of the fact that there hasn't been an all-clear signal yet, we're not supposed to go out - and I have the idea you stay down for quite a while when you do this.]"
"190"	"(8/17/87)"	"I'm with or associated with some branch of the government and I know the office where Adderly works (but I don't actually work there myself) and I have something to tell him about a girl who's the center of the case he's working, but I can't get to him to tell him. I've been at the scene where something had happened and there were a lot of men doing the police-y things they do at crime scenes, but I couldn't get inside, so now I'm here at the office but he's not. He does come in briefly but has to leave again right away and I'm pretty much at a loss and so are the other girls here. What we have is a kind of counter-office enclosure like you see in old buildings (I'm thinking of the car-license area in the Records Building, where there's public traffic and individual desks both) and 3 or 4 office-girls work in here, but they're not ""operational"", as it were. I give up and go outside the enclosure to go away and I talk to a girl I know who's at the front of the counter and sticking up through it. There's some reason for this normally but she's in here this time trying to fix something. There's a door inside that slides up and down to open the compartment where you sit with your head and shoulders (and arms?) out of the counter, to deal with the public. She's having trouble with the door and shows me. I commiserate and leave. After I leave I go for a drive (?) out in the country. As I continue on the road that led out of town it gets narrower and the fields grow right up to it and finally tall plants - corn, maybe, or wheat - are overhead and you can't see from side to side. I stop at the entrance to a sort of crafts fair or show or something, off to the left in a building or set of buildings behind the plants. [They remind me of another crafts fair I dreamed about, that was in something like a monastery. Very open place.] I go into a room where there are exhibits of Victorian lace and dolls and pretty bedroom furniture. At the same time a little girl and her mother come into the room, and the little girl is very pretty, dressed like a doll herself, and has a tail on a string that she's dragging around with her, as if it were a pull-toy. [Does she have a cat with her, as well? Dunno.] I look at this tail as well as I can without staring, and I think it's a cat's tail, but I think to myself, ""surely it can't be - perhaps a rabbit's instead"". [Notwithstanding rabbits' tails aren't long and striped.] Her mama says something to her, and the drift of the comment includes a remark about her kitties - such as a reference to ""when we got blank and blank"" (whatever their names were), and presumably one of them is still here [aha - does this mean she does have a cat with her?] . I ask casually what about the other cat and Mama says ""Oh, he died"" - of something or other - however she put it, it was made plain that the cat died naturally and this tail is a sort of memento for the kid. I'm relieved."
"191"	"(8/19/87)"	"I'm at work [which isn't the library, at least as I know it] and I'm making records on some kind of imprinting machine - it makes plastic labels like a label gun does. I ask my supervisor what to call it, and (he/she?) says something incoherent and goes off. This has been happening lately, and it's getting worse. (He/she?) is a trifle hostile with it, and I'm wondering - along with the other people here - how it's going to end. (He/she?) is going off (his/her?) rocker, and yet is still the boss here. Mostly we're ignoring it and getting the job done anyway, but it can't go on forever. I'm on a roof or ledge, with a rail around it, not a very big place, just concrete, next to probably an apartment house. There are several other girls here with me, people I work with I think, and we're just talking. Across the street is a foreign-car garage - it doesn't look like one, of course, it's a small but architecturally interesting (stucco?) building with 2 sections, looking rather like cylinders. We know what it is because we know MT runs it - it's new, he just got set up and this is a pretty mature and positive thing to do. Also pretty classy, because he's working on fancy cars for fancy people. There isn't much room on this ledge and the rail isn't very high, but I lean out over it for a better look at this garage while we're talking. MT himself comes and joins us. He doesn't look like he used to. He's shaved his beard and his hair is a different style and he looks pensive and a little sad. [Actually, of course, it's not even MT's face, beard or no beard - it's still a small regular face with dark hair and eyes - also no glasses! - but it's a handsomer face with softer features.] I'm sitting on a concrete ledge on the street next to a vendor of pastries - this is a downtown area, very bustling, cosmopolitan - open-air bistros and vendors, pedestrians. MT is sitting on my right and a couple I know rather better are sitting on my left. We're all three chatting away, but MT is sort of detached and pensive. It starts to rain, pretty hard too, and I have an umbrella which after a moment's fumbling I get up and put over both of us. Me and MT, that is, and he seems a little surprised. The other couple get up and leave (I think to get out of the rain), but we stay and the rain slacks off. I talk to the pastry man a bit and he shows me his wares. It's a bit awkward with MT, we're both being kind of shy. I thought it was odd that the umbrella turned out to be big enough for both of us easily, but we don't have to squeeze up against each other. I find him only mildly attractive because of his looks and his shyness, but I'm sure the reticence goes much deeper and I don't like that. I'm sure I don't want to get involved with him."
"192"	"(8/222/87)"	"I'm at a small fair, an old-fashioned theme fair, taking place on a parking lot and in a small building or so, some booths set up inside. I've arrived in a little vehicle that's more like a table, painted red, that you operate single-handed, it sort of flies and sort of rolls. I came by myself, and I've run into Trisha and Lori - they knew I'd be here and we planned to meet. We've gone into this little building and Trisha and I are talking at the counter of this food booth while I look over what they've got and decide what to order. I know the middle-aged blonde lady behind the counter has seen me but she hasn't asked what I want. A man comes up to the counter and orders something (they have some interesting, old-fashioned food here) and I'm sort of vaguely conscious of hearing the woman say ""That's the last one"" but didn't know what she was talking about. Finally I turn back to see if I can order something, and see that all the food's been taken away and the place shut down. The woman and her assistant are still there around the corner and I go ask her how come she didn't wait on me. She's very brusque and uncaring and says I didn't seem to want anything, so she didn't ask. I feel very hurt and slighted - first she waits on that man before, giving him the last of something before I even get a turn, now she shuts the place down and I can't even get anything to eat. I'm hungry - this isn't fair. I'm also embarrassed that I got into this fix. I go out with Trisha and Lori, but I veer off when they're not looking and go to my ""car"" and go away. (To drive this thing you start it very much like a car, with both feet, then ""drive"" it with your hands and your feet trail out behind if you want, or you can keep them up - doing a kind of front bend. Mainly all you do is steer. I don't think you can go up very high, but the wheels on the legs don't always touch the ground.) I drive away and back ""home"" (I think) down a road with an open hill and wide view of town (much like Hampton hill), then to a neighborhood. [I think I live here - it's sort of like a cross between streets and an apartment hallway. Families live here, and know each other - somebody's always leaning out the front door and talking to someone, or having people over.]"
"193"	"(9/6/87)"	"I'm at a little gallery or building being used for one, it used to be a house, I imagine. We're setting up an art show in the front room - there are maybe half a dozen artists or less, one of whom is MT, I'm assisting him. This is not just people with oil paintings, it's a variety of things, and what M is showing are little airplanes. They're not replicas, or toys exactly, but they're stylized and cute. The group of people have exhibited together before, and it's a cooperative effort. They've been doing this once a year - though this may only be the 2nd year, I don't know. Anyway, there are people bustling about, putting things up, looking after details. There's somebody in charge, he comes around to check how things are going every now and then, nice polite friendly guy in a suit. One of the things I'm doing is looking out for anything odd. Last year there was a disturbance, a robbery or something, and this time MT has assigned me to poke around and see if there's anything out of the ordinary to suggest something similar might happen. I haven't seen anything, but I have been around to the back of the house and gone into a couple of other rooms. We're behaving kind of like secret agents or something, but we really don't want anything to happen.MT has one of his airplanes suspended on a thread from the ceiling, and I decide it will look better near the entrance where some other things are, to give people coming in a hint of what they'll see. It comes down easily enough, but I'll need help getting it stuck back up, so I go fetch a chair. There's a bar in this room, a padded one like you see in - well, bars, with lots of glasses and it curves around. I get a chair from there. A friend offers to help and I do need it - he's not quite Don Mahon, but that's who I think of. So we tack the thread up where I want the airplane to hang."
"194"	"(9/17/87)"	"I'm moving into a new place - a small frame house, oldish, not fancy or in the best of repair, but it's got character and it's on a nice quiet street with trees and bushes and flowers. There's a couple of huge bushes out front next to the walk, and the place is almost enclosed by foliage on the sides. It has a sort-of porch on the front, or a closed-off part of the yard, no floor to it. Tree is here, and maybe MB and Rio, too, but I'm not sure about them - certainly some other cats are here. There are boxes about, some furniture, definitely looks like somebody just moving in and making do. I go out on the ""porch"" for some reason, and Tree goes with me. I'm not altogether sure this is a good idea because he might be able to get outside - this isn't all that secure. By George, he has gotten out, under the ""fence"" over on the - suddenly I have a memory of this being fenced in, not a porch - how can it be two things at once? But I have a clear picture of both in my mind as I write. I'm very concerned about Tree being outside - all kinds of things could happen to him. I'd better go get him - but I'm not wearing any clothes. I try calling to him, but he won't come in. So I'm going inside to put something on, some shorts. I go out to see if I can persuade him to come back in. It's dark, just before dawn, and I don't expect anybody will see me. Tree is under those big bushes, facing another cat, a big tough neighborhood tom who's itching for a fight. They're doing all the pre-fight staring and growling and I'm still just calling to Tree to come in. Just as I go toward him, a car comes down the street - the headlights are on, of course, and they can probably see me. I can see it's a couple of nice-looking young guys in the car, and I sure don't want them to see my boobs hanging out like this, so I turn away with my arms in front of my chest and go back somewhat out of the light. I decide I'd better go back in and put on a T-shirt. I'm inside, telling the other cats what's going on and how I'm worried about Tree, somewhat frantically looking for a T-shirt, when suddenly it's light outside. And as I'm noticing that and just getting a shirt on, here's Tree back in - I'm wondering how he got back in so fast, and didn't make a sound."
"195"	"(9/18/87)"	"I'm with Lauren and Trisha, downtown, near the library - Trisha is getting a job downtown somewhere and we're talking about how we can go to lunch together. For practice we decide we'll go now, and Trisha suggests this one place that's in the Center. I propose that it's too far away, but she says there's good fast roads and the tollway you can get there by. So we go in her car and swing way out left of downtown (what would be west, since I'm looking north) and we go on some roads I don't recognize. The areas look like some other town, some much older town. There are some nice buildings here, and some nice-looking apartment buildings with vacancy signs - I'd like very much to investigate this. It would be a nice place to live. Somehow we end up not at a restaurant but at their (?) house. [It's a newer house than the one they live in, but still probably Fifties.] It's very reminiscent of houses we lived in (my family) when I was a kid, and there's not much furniture or stuff on the walls, as if they just moved in. (The light reminds me of the house in The suburbs.) [There was more after this: I think a cat was involved and something hanging on a doorknob, but it's gone now.]"
"196"	"(10/1/87)"	"I'm at a workshop with John Boats but (most?) of these people I don't know - it's pretty big, being held partly in a big arena, partly in a small room or gym with risers. In the arena something takes place where I have to go to the stage. In the other place we've brought our overnight gear and I keep getting up and rearranging my bags, which seem to keep multiplying. They're mostly tote bags like my dingy canvas one, but my suitcase is here, too, and all this stuff got dumped when we came in the room and I don't want people to trip over it. I hope I'm being quiet enough but I know I'm becoming a nuisance getting up over and over - it's obsessive. John is writing things on a board, but it's turned at an angle that makes it hard for me to read. It's as though he's talking about business, or a business he's using as an example of something. I'm not following, of course. The people I'm sitting near are a young married couple with a child or two. The things they talk about are so different, they seem older than me, but I don't think they are, much. The workshop ends (or there's a break), and some of us go out to the lobby where there's a big display of or about some company, fictitious, meant to demonstrate something, and built by this young man that's here. There are several people visiting from outside too. As we look we discuss what we were learning and it seems this display company is sort of plagiarized from or a rehashing of the one John was talking about. The young man looks slightly sheepish but amused."
"197"	"(10/1/87)"	"I'm supposed to marry a guy who's a lot like My ex - I said I would because I thought it was too late for me to find another man who'd be willing to marry me and I'm worried I'll be sorry if I don't, later. I'm thinking about this and how I don't want to go through with it but I guess I can stand it. Then I think of having sex with him and can't stand the idea. I decide to break it off with him. He's a wimpy little guy with glasses and I think of him in a dark suit."
"198"	"(10/2/87)"	"I've got to get to work and am late for the bus so I've decided to run to work. I've dressed for it in shorts and no shoes and I'm running along Cedar where the Field bus goes but of course it's all different. I run up on a broken-off concrete strip for a bit, then get down, knowing it's dangerous - next to an apartment building, the ground rises from the sidewalk*. Every now and then I turn and look for a bus. I'm conscious of being late for work this way - if I do get a bus I may as well not bother running, but one doesn't come. I notice I'm running on my toes and try to concentrate on using my heels. I turn toward downtown as the bus does and start through a black neighborhood with a sort of honkytonk bit. I pass a brick shops-block and look inside a window of a place that's a bar, apparently, and it fits, there's stuff like beer ads on the wall but the room is empty. [It's still darkish outside.] Shortly I pick my way over a lot of broken beer-bottle glass in the parking lot, and turn right again; now I've got to get through a sleazier part before I get to where downtown starts being business. I run into an old man who wants me to stop and I sort of dance backwards to hear him. Then he brings out a knife and says he wants my money - I tell him I don't have any and he's not very good at this, he just looks a bit sad and dithers. I say I'm sorry and turn to run on and immediately run into a young man, blondish hair, jacket, jeans, who stops me the same way but gets up close to me. I grab his hands and try to hold them out, but he's stronger than me, he's already got a knife and he works it to point at the back of my thigh and I realize I can't stop him and he's mean. He asks left or right? I don't know what he means and he jabs it at (into?) my leg and says ""shall I turn it to the left or right?"" Apparently the damage done would be different. I'm scared and petrified."
"199"	"(10/2/87)"	"I'm at sea on a military ship - I'm the captain and I'm nearly in charge but there's this other officer (played by William Hurt) who's capable of interfering with my plans, and a woman officer who's not actually a shipboard officer but something like an investigator or a shrink and she seems to have it in for me. Something's been going wrong on the ship and it's like a mystery-story. Wm. Hurt seems to be well-liked and the crew (there are women among them) like to do what he says. They don't precisely ignore me but I could ask for better cooperation. Actually I like him too but this is awkward. Wm. is trying to repair something in a sort of hole in a wall of electronic equipment; he's had to like jam his whole body inside this small opening to check things out, and there are some crewmen helping him. There's a large Styrofoam cup with something nasty in it (that somehow I acquire) and when I ask about what to do with it I get a snotty reply [from whom?] , so I throw it on the floor. Actually somebody jostled me and some spilled first, which startled me and I dropped it. Now I'm really frustrated. I look around for someone to clean it up. There are some crew sitting at some small tables right here around the corner as though we've just been having a tea or something, and some of them get up and leave. I call out, ""Is anybody here free to come clean up this floor?"" or words to that effect and reluctantly a couple come forward. The stuff in the cup was both oily and caustic, so this requires some special attention. I'm actually embarrassed to have someone else clean it up since it was my fault, and I am fighting the urge to do it myself, but I'm the captain here and I know I shouldn't do that sort of thing. So I set them to doing the job and go back to Wm. Hurt and the ""investigator"". She's there next to the wall where he is with a plate of french fries and something else - I think she made them herself - that she's feeding him. I comment on this and she snidely remarks that he hasn't had anything to eat in ____ long and he needs to keep his strength up. I sample one of the fries when I think she's not looking, very big and fresh they are. This work he's doing on the ship seems to be sabotage, but I don't know what the results of it would be except to get us off course. The ""investigator"" says she wants to tell me something round the corner, and we move off. I'm standing, not facing her, expecting her to move around further, and someone starts talking in a voice that sounds mechanical. It says something about now that we're within sight of land, we'll be getting ready to (what? do a proper investigation?) since it was my fault. I don't think I heard right, and I don't know where it was coming from, so I say ""Who's that? Repeat that, please"" or something and she starts over, it's coming from her, I don't know why her voice sounds like that, and I don't know what she means about ""it"" being ""my fault"". Nor was I aware we were anywhere near land, but I can see we are, just barely on the horizon. Also: I'm with a man at a shop or something, looking for a teapot. This tubby little old woman only has 2, one's squattier than the other, both pottery, and she says (or a sign says?) they come with strainers. When we choose one, the squatty one, she digs around and brings out a plastic thing that's not even round and doesn't look like a strainer to me, and we try to fit it into the pot and of course it won't go. We call it to her attention. I think it was just a minor ruse."
"200"	"(10/3/87)"	"[Not much retained of larger dream.] I'm with Tree, sort of, but he's big and white like Lick - is it Lick after all? - I don't think so. We're going around the block, sort of [don't remember why] . What I seem to see is an area laid out kind of like a game board, and I started going to the left, or counter-clockwise. I'm passing through yards or houses, whatever's more convenient, and one house in the middle of this side I go into looks empty, but it's not. I step into this room through an outside door, and as soon as I get inside I know something's different. I stand there for a second and suddenly there's this great big power that takes over. It's kind of like a hurricane force, it keeps me standing still and I can just barely move with a great effort. I know this is some kind of entity, it's very agitated but not actually angry - it didn't want to be disturbed, I think, is the problem, and I've just walked in on it without knocking. All the same, if I'm gonna get out of its way I've got to move, and I realize I could just stay here and be paralyzed and frightened, but I know I can handle it if I just stay calm and try to breathe evenly. That's hard - I can't breathe easily under this pressure but I do the best I can and get it under control enough to break loose, get Tree, and lurch across to the other door, which is standing partly open with the daylight coming through it. (The room is old-looking, bare walls and wood floor, no furniture to speak of, and dark.) As I get through the door, I turn and face back into the room, where this force is still raging at me, and I want it to know I mean it no harm and wish it well, so I try to make the Peace sign with my right hand and say it aloud. Takes some effort but I finally do it. Then I go on. [There's no fear in this, but a sense of being able to handle all this force and come out on top. There's a little touch of exasperation at the overreaction, and the ""Peace"" sign is what I feel the situation calls for. After that, I leave it to its own devices, I'm complete with it.] I go on to round the block, and pass by a house with a family and a litter of kittens. Tree goes across the street while I look at them. We eventually get back where we were."
"201"	"(10/4/87)"	"I'm with George and several other yoga people including Cynthia, hanging around a street corner, getting ready to go on a yoga trip to the Middle East somewhere (not India, but some unspecified place in the Middle East). Cynthia has some name-tag labels, just narrow strips, and she puts her own on. (I can read ""Cynthia"" on it.) So we get on a plane and make a trip, landing at a very small airport that turns out to be Indianapolis. That's as far as we got on the first leg of this trip. I've been very worried about the expense of this trip, I'm not sure I can afford it - it'll be several hundred dollars altogether and I'm not sure I want to spend all that. I was worried about it before but everybody said, come on, you'll love it, you'll see, and so I came along. I know I can charge a lot of it to MasterCard, but do I really want to? Now that I'm here, I see this tiny little airport, and I'm not at all sure I want to leave at all. It's a little building on a tree-lined country lane, lovely place [somehow I didn't realize Indianapolis wasn't a big city after all] , I'm wondering if I can get a job here, at least for a while. [Note: we came south to get here from where we started.] Actually this is a library as well as an airport terminal. That's very handy, it's a very nice little small-town library with standard modern equipment. I seek out a bathroom, find it down a short hall and have to maneuver amongst boxes and stacks of things, and I do have a bowel movement. But (the same way it is with peeing) even as I stand up I have the same urge and have to go again right away, and I discover I haven't taken my underpants down. I'm disconcerted about this, now I've got shit in my pants, I hope I can deal with it before somebody finds out. I feel very exposed and it doesn't even seem as if I'm in the bathroom now, but out in the building."
"202"	"(10/10/87)"	"I'm going to a horror movie with Linda and some other people, including my brother and Tim- maybe 8 or 9 of us altogether. We get there after they do, and go into what looks like a standard theater like the Village was. The place is huge and packed. We sit on the end of the row in back of the others, and people are milling about, it doesn't ever exactly quiet down, and the movie starts. It really is a horror film, really gross - lots of people are really disgusted, including Thai and others of my party, and they leave at intermission. It doesn't bother me much, and someone else with us, she's just been closing her eyes, which she thinks is good enough. At intermission we go to the lobby to get popcorn and things - I find peanuts (salted, Spanish) in a basket and sort of try to grab what I can with my hand, wondering why there are loose peanuts at a movie theater, when the guy behind the counter shows me these little bags and a scoop. So I fill myself up a little bag and go back to my seat. Actually things are starting to get raucous now - the movie hasn't restarted and people are standing up talking, some maybe shouting, Linda and I decide to go out for something and come back. [Don't know what for - maybe just a walk.] We go out the regular front doors, then somewhere out in the neighborhood, then come to the end of a street and back to the theater at the other end, but now it's an open-air theater, we're looking up at the rows of seats, facing the people. They really are stirred up now, this is looking more and more like a rally with dangerous people (a lot of black leather jackets) being pumped up by somebody on the stage. As a matter of fact, the whole scene is creepy - that guy on the stage could be Dracula, and we've both got the feeling we maybe shouldn't try to run away since these people can all see us, but we're real reluctant to go back to our seats up through all these people. Somehow, though, we get there, and I take myself into the back of the theater, where there are some corridors (very plain - no doors, nothing on the walls) - I go down them to this open area, not a proper room, exactly, where there's a counter on the left, and a picnic basket. I take some things out of it - I'm fixing a sandwich, I think. [I don't know when this basket was put here - I don't remember bringing it here - and I don't know why it's a secret.] I'm starting on my way back when I get accosted by a little blonde kid with a little bitty knife. He wants to know why I'm not with the others, as if I'm trying to run away, which I'm certainly not, from back here - I don't think you can even get out this way. He's very supercilious and thinks he's real tough with this dinky little knife - probably from watching those other toughs with their big ones - but I certainly know the thing could do plenty of damage anyway, and I grab his hand and hold it away. Then there pops in a little blonde girl about his size, also with a knife and the same bad attitude. I grab her hand too and I'm wondering what to do next when I wake up. I'm holding the image in my mind, experimenting with threatening to poke one of the kids' eye out with his/her knife, and I go back to sleep and find myself captured, I've been taken to a house somewhere where this Dracula and a woman are holding me. [I don't know what for, unless for being subversive to their cause.] One or another of them talks for a while, being very threatening, do-you-know-what-I'll-do-to-you-if-you-don't-talk, that sort of thing. Then somehow I find myself in the back of an RV of some type, with a couple of guys and a little girl or two, their daughter (or daughters?). I know Dracula has sent me here, though it doesn't look like any sort of punishment. But we can't get out of the thing and it's starting to roll toward a cliff. (We're in a forest-campground sort of place, and they were on a camping trip.) It really does look like we're going to go over, though there's a couple of false starts."
"203"	"(10/10/87)"	"Linda and I are running this movie theater, and showing this big-time, quite long movie by means of a video player. It's not a real big theater, it's oldish, reminds me of the one in Schulenberg that I didn't see, but how such a place might be - got patterned rugs on the floor, globe lamps, velveteen seats, bit of gingerbread - not glamorous, but old-timey. The audience doesn't fit well with the place - a lot of 'em are tough types, and you want to keep them happy. The movie we're showing is this long saga about this young man's odyssey through the world, he gets into lots of very different situations, wars, romances, human interest stuff, learning all about the world, etc. Can't tell exactly when it's set, maybe covers a few hundred years, maybe only an appropriate length of the 19th century - it's got so many locations you'd think he couldn't do them all in a lifetime. But it's definitely historical - not the recent past. The audience is pretty attentive and seem to like it. I have to do something at the video console, which is off to the audience's left, and there's all this equipment in front of me, and lots of buttons. I'm supposed to be setting up a future part of the movie and I push the wrong button. I don't know what I've done for a bit, although something does seem to be wrong; then I realize I've punched in a much later part of the movie, which is now on the screen. I don't really know how to fix it, and I start examining buttons, which doesn't help much. I hit one that (I think) starts a soundtrack from another part, and it's coming across at the same time as the other scenes. Linda comes over to ask what's gone wrong, some of these guys are losing interest and leaving. She says to turn the sound down on the other track and that's harder to do than you'd think, but I got it there eventually. Then we try to fix the scene back and don't get it; Linda says we'll just have to rewind the thing back to where it was. This is awful. The movie is well along at this point and it'll be a long way back - in fact, the rewind goes slower than I thought, and the picture stays on the screen. We see all sorts of things (to ""come"", in the proper sequence) - sailing ships, a map of the world, people doing different things and wearing different clothes, all sorts of stuff. It seems it'll be forever till we get back to the gypsy camp where we left him, but I guess we do. I get up and go out later - there aren't a whole lot of people here now - and go outside, a few doors down the street and around the corner. [I don't know what for unless to hide.] After a bit, I think I may come back in, though I'm rather afraid to - I think those tough guys may know it was me who screwed the movie up and come after me. I look back at the theater - it's dark on the street and I see the darkened marquee (old-style, rows of light bulbs) and the dark ticket window, and nobody about. As I come closer, I don't hear any sounds either. (There are no doors on the front.) I walk in very quietly - I don't think there's anybody here at all, but then I hear sounds. Somebody's coming up and out of the theater. Since I don't know who it is, I think I'd better hide. There's a parlor off to the left, with old-fashioned chairs and tables, doilies and antimacassars. No place good to hide, though, so I get down behind a chair at the very back of the room in the shadows, figuring I won't be noticeable if they don't look this way. There's a door next to me (kitchen door?) but I don't have time to go through it quietly. As they come into view, though, I see it's not who I was afraid of, but a man and a woman (or so - I don't know who, but one might be My brother; I don't think they're a couple) and 2 little girls, one of whom was in the film. I get up and greet them, explaining why I was hiding, and saying how pleased I am to see them. I talk to the little girl who acted in the film and tell her what a good job she did. (She has dark hair and is dressed in a pretty little dress. I seem to have her be the same as the little girl who was in the RV going over the cliff.)"
"204"	"(10/12/87)"	"I'm in a kind of theater watching a sort of improvisational group (all young, eager-to-break-out types) do a variety of, shall we say, experimental pieces. None of them are anything to write home about, and one bit is just plain bad - a girl is doing a dance that might have been meant for ballet, but mostly consists of her moving from place to place and posing. At one point the audience is expected to participate - we get up and sort of march around. (This theater is more like a gym with bleachers in it, only one side, but I do think it's not really.) We go up and then around a bit - this one woman and I (she's older than me, rather housewifely, short middle-class hair, decade-off clothes with a scarf) march all the way around to the front again and by that time they've started doing something else, and we sort of hesitate for a second to walk in front of the other people, but we do anyway - it's not as if we're disturbing anybody. Another time there's a sort of intermission, and some of us go outside. There's a little shop nearby [where I see or find something that I react to - either something I've been wanting, or something I'm surprised at, or something I've got one of and I'm pleased to see another. Don't remember] ."
"205"	"(10/12/87)"	"I'm setting off on a trip in my car [much as I actually plan to do] and I need to stop at Lori's karate school. She and the teacher are going to be late this morning and somebody's got to open it up for some ladies who take an early class. It's a nice quiet morning, grayish before the sun's properly out, crisp. I drive up the semicircular drive where there's a bit of canopy entrance. (Not fabric - it's that the door has a projection-thingy over it, I don't know what to call it.) There are like yucca plants in the landscaping. Looks very homey for a karate school. I'm early, so I wait for a bit, then they show up. I let them in and Lori and her teacher also show up, earlier than they'd figured, and they invite me in for a visit before I go. I stay in the car for a minute or two, checking out the steering wheel, which is giving me a bit of trouble, you know I just had some work done on the front end, I hope there's not still a problem. Well, by Jove, I discover the steering wheel is just barely being held on by one rather ""sprung"" spring. It has been operating, though, so far, but I know I can't expect to get much farther with it in that condition. I really don't want to delay my trip any further but geez it really looks like I'd better. That thing could just pop off any time. I go inside to see what I can see. One thing about this school is there's a lot of cats about. Actually they sort of raise cats here, and there's one that's blind. I've heard about him but never actually met him. Or her. Now I'm in this room here, and by George here's this cat! He/she is white, shorthaired, has a nice sturdy body, round head, sweet face, and no eyes. Just not there. A slope of fur where the eyes should be. I'm a bit taken aback, but I'm fascinated. I'm also aware that this cat is considered very wise, and now I understand why. He/she just sort of radiates wisdom. I'm glad to be here with it. I get up on the ledge/cushion/whatever that the cat is sitting on - she just came here and calmly situated herself - she doesn't seem to need eyes to see. She makes a kind of trilling sound, and then says, ""Come up, ____"" (speaking the name of another cat who's come up to the place we're sitting). I can't even see the other cat and didn't hear it come up, but she knew it was there and wanted to come be with the white cat. I'm just a little surprised at hearing her speak at all, but I have such a profound respect for her that it doesn't seem odd at all. I am just amazed and awed, and while I'm surprised at the depth of my reaction to her, I'm enjoying the feelings so much, it doesn't matter."
"206"	"(1/1/88)"	"I'm with some other people - friends, I'm not sure who, but they were like MT, maybe even my brother, and even Don and Lauren or somebody, and we were going to look at a house. This house was on a residential street that had some very nice large houses on it. We were looking for a house that we might want to rent, and we first went past it to the end of the street, and we looked at the numbers and went back to it. The houses at the end of the street were extremely nice, and looked very expensive indeed, and when we backed up a bit to go back to the house we wanted, it seemed to be at least something less formal, and maybe more likely, but still an awfully nice house. We were surprised that the person we were thinking of renting it from lived there, because it was somebody more or less our age, like us, that wouldn't necessarily be able to afford a big house like that. So we went up to the door and knocked and looked at the outside. The person that answered was female, and she let us in and said she'd show us around, nice and friendly, and what we saw on the inside is not at all what we expected. There was this enormous room, broken up into areas, and it had another level to it as though it were a sunken living room. It was very open - there wasn't a whole lot of furniture. There were people around, and it looked very reminiscent of a ""hippie pad"" from the early 70's or 60's or more like a commune where a lot of people were living in the same place and just sort of having a good time, and not just being roommates or residents or something like that. And there seemed to be people having a good time around. The girl that was with us just took us on through into the living-room sort of area and straight across to a door that led into a small sort of shed, really, that you're meant to go through and you go outside from. Before we got there, I was looking outside through a plate glass window on the right and saw a kind of little patio or garden sort of thing, it wasn't real small, it had bushes and stuff in it. And there was a cat or two sitting out there [something happened about the cat but I don't quite remember] - it was large and black (if memory serves), and it kinda did something and left. Then we went into the shed and I was bringing up the rear. Everybody went back out again, but I was interested in something that was hanging in the shed. It was kind of like a potting shed, although they had [""been stuck"" (?)] certain things as well as plants - it was maybe kind of a greenhouse, I guess, or something in between. I took whatever it was off the wall and went outside with it to have a better look at it. It seems to me that it was like, terracotta [and I don't remember what it was] . After I'd looked at it [and nobody else was ____?] I took it back in and hung it back up on the wall again. NEXT: I am on trial for something that I do not know exactly, but it surely would have had to do with something like embezzlement. What they were questioning was how I had so much money to spend, why I had such nice things. There were a whole lot of people there, it was more like an auditorium than a courtroom - there were people up on the sides, like bleachers or something, and the light in the courtroom was very bright. The prosecutor was very strong and powerful, he wasn't entirely angry - of course he wasn't supposed to be angry, but he was real determined that I should be - examined as thoroughly as possible, in case I had done this. (Whatever it was.) He would ask how I could afford to buy - like clothes, or something, how I could afford to have such nice things, on my salary. During the course of this trial, they had called for a physical examination of me, like an operation, even - they wanted to make cuts in my body to examine something - not going all the way inside to the organs, and so forth, but kinda superficial cuts where you cut the skin in long straight lines down the arms and down the torso. Maybe something to do with bacteria or something, I don't know. I was real concerned about that, but I was not real concerned about the trial in general. There was a place in the back of the courtroom - it was rather more like a dressing room, and I had, of course, my lawyer, and some other people helping me out - I guess they would be like people on my lawyer's staff or something - an older woman, blonde, professional-type woman; my lawyer was a man in a suit, you know, your basic sort of lawyer, certainly not a kid, but your basic yuppie professional. And they were, like, attending on me like I was - oh, dear, somebody like a TV star or something - I would be in the back, getting ""dressed"", getting my hair done, stuff like that, it wasn't very luxurious, but it was certainly not what you would expect of being in a courtroom. In fact, I wasn't even in the courtroom - I wasn't even paying attention to how the trial was going except for the sound of the prosecutor's voice. He was quite loud and determined - making a ""show"" for the audience - and most of 'em were my friends, and they didn't want to see me get into trouble. They were interested, certainly, but he was definitely going to have to prove what he alleged. And all of these questions seemed to me to be real obviously geared to getting me into trouble, because everything he was asking could be answered very simply, and he wasn't listening to what - well, it wasn't that he wasn't listening to what I had to say because I wasn't there for him to hear, but I was the one who could clear it up in the first place, and until he got me on the stand where I could tell him these things, it seemed like there wasn't much point in him even asking. Nobody else could tell him that I wouldn't buy anything very expensive unless it was on sale, and I charge things, and pay them out, and sometimes people take me to lunch or something, or I may buy myself meals and not get my hair cut, things like that. I certainly haven't stolen anything, and sometimes I do think I spend more than I need to - or, well, not more than I need to but more than I can afford to, but that's my problem, it's certainly not anybody else's money and I don't know why I should be on trial for it. But this physical examination thing concerned me quite a lot. There's kind of a conflict here. I have the impression that I have already had this examination, and it didn't really work the way they thought it was going to. But I think that isn't logical because that wouldn't have happened and there wouldn't have been any point in me being concerned about it further, but I was - I was concerned about having it done correctly, and fascinated with the procedure itself. And so there weren't actually any cuts on my body, it's as though they had tried to and it wouldn't do it. So I was interested in that, and I just decided I'd do it myself. I got something to cut with - you see, I'm not in the courtroom at the moment, and whoever has been with me in the ""dressing room"" area - what I mean by that, by the way, is that it's back off of the courtroom, assuredly, but it's not closed off from it - there's a place where you can go, like, to change clothes, but it's just a back room open to the courtroom, all the way in the back where nobody can turn around and look at you, or nobody's doing it, they're not - or, their attention is out in the middle of the court - anyway, so whoever has been with me back there has gone away so I'm alone, and I got something like a razor blade and started to make these cuts myself. [It surely would be awkward if you did that - lying down, and trying to even make the sort of cut I'm talking about with one arm, without looking at it, but it's as though I wasn't doing it that way, it's as though I was doing it from outside my body. And was a little bit ragged and awkward at it at first, but eventually I got the hang of it and - this is how it seemed awkward to me, as though I was doing it from right over my body, and - just like you would a doll, you know - straight down, and I discovered that it was awkward to do - the right-hand side of my body (lying on the ground), which seems to be the left-hand side from the position I'm actually cutting in. So, what I needed to do is to move around, so I moved down to where I was really facing the side of my body to do that. This is all very slow and awkward, but there wasn't any blood or anything. Well, I did that, and I don't know anything more about it - it obviously didn't hurt particularly, I know I kept expecting it to - I kept expecting it to feel at least, you know, like it does when you cut yourself, so I was a little bit surprised that it didn't bleed, but I wasn't worried about there being any real damage or anything because I knew I would heal up. And quite sure that I knew I'd heal up without scars, too. Just didn't seem that big a deal. But now I felt like I had done it, for them. That they would be happy now. It was like I have accomplished whatever it was they wanted me to do for them."
"207"	"(1/1/88)"	"I'm supposed to marry Michael J. Fox (or Alex Keaton - the whole family is in this) and I'm at their house meeting this young woman who's a bridal consultant or something, she's come to interview us, to plan the wedding. Actually Alleycat's father is a minister, and he's going to perform the ceremony. Part of their house is a chapel - actually it seems to be a separate house, but somehow I think it's used for more than just services. It's a pretty place, lots of trees and green shade, a sort of ranch-style house on one level, and the chapel is higher, you have to walk up a few steps - they both face the driveway and the chapel's on the right as you face them. [It reminds me of that barn-sort-of place in Edom - maybe it used to be a barn.] Very idyllic setting. I've come up to the walkway to the chapel door (which is open and you can see inside - there are family members about, the father and daughters) with the consultant and we've sat down on a bench to talk. She gets out a notebook and asks where we want to have the service, and I tell her about this place, and how Alleycat's father will do the ceremony. She asks me who else is in his family, and I start describing them, and when I'm talking about his sister Mallory, I start to say her age is 20 [which I guess it isn't yet, in ""real"" life] and then I think maybe I shouldn't say that because then Alleycat's age will come up and she may not like that. But I say it by accident anyway and the consultant [she, by the way, has dark hair, sort of a professional medium-long do, and a suit - she's probably younger than I am] does ask about Alleycat, and I sort of fumble about that and say he's 24, no, 26 I think, dah dah dah. Now she knows how old I am, and does in fact look askance at this, and asks me if everybody's amenable to this. They are, oh yes, I like the family and they like me, and Alleycat and I are really in love. There are some lingering apprehensions all around, but nothing so serious."
"208"	"(1/2/88)"	"I've just driven up to a restaurant - a garden-y sort of place, set into some trees, the entrance faces sideways from the street and the parking is in the back. Close to the back of the building, you can drive up to a sign that has on it who's dining there at the moment. [I don't know, actually, why I've come there, but it seems like I meant to meet somebody.] I drive up to the sign and am delighted to see Adam 's name on it, somewhere in the middle. [In fact I clearly see his first name, but the last isn't clear in my mind.] I figure Jane and Ken must be there with him, so I'll get to see them. Hooray! So I'm parking the car, and I go inside. [Whatever happens next, I don't go all the way in and see them, I think - somehow I go through the rear entrance and past the dining room, to the main entrance.] This is a nice place, classy but not snooty, a bit countrified. Lots of windows and air, but not bright lights. A muted, greenish atmosphere. I go out the main entrance and pause for a minute while I do [something or other - something in here about some people greeting me, I haven't seen 'em in a while, all very jolly, happy to see each other, making quick plans to meet later] and set down my purse on a ledge at the top of the step. I go on down the steps and turn toward the parking lot, and somebody calls out to me that I've forgotten my purse (from behind me? where?). I look up to see that a guy is picking up my purse, and it appears he means to make off with it - I shout at him, ""Put that down!"" and actually he does, but he does it rather casually and he opens it up and looks in it. (It's my regular purse, by the way.) He takes out the cash that's in there, and also (I think) my card case. He looks at me, smirking, and starts to walk off - going across the front of the restaurant's lawn through some trees toward the street. I start to chase after him, and he runs, but hasn't got far, so I catch him and grab his hand. I swing him around, hauling as hard as I can, and twist, and maybe I've even broken his wrist. He falls down and I hit him."
"209"	"(1/6/88)"	"I'm watching a film - TV, I think - with a bunch of other people, and it seems sort of - oh, teenage-pregnancy-and-why-you-shouldn't-get-married-and-have-kids - or even just have kids - film, and what they're doing is that there's some sort of party scene, it's a large, Latin sort of family, Mexican possibly, and a young girl and young boy and baby, and parents, and grandparents and all that, and they have one scene after another of people interacting with each other; and what you see is this boy and this girl who have got the baby, while they're with each other and with the baby, they look like they might be grownups or something, because you see couples like that - and when you get them with, for instance, her middleaged mother or his father, they are definitely still children. This you can get a sense of, just from seeing how they interact with each other. I'm actually watching them with this same family, and then when it's over with we go into their - I guess, living room - they live in an apartment - I think it's across the street from me; I'm a neighbor and I visit; and so we all sort of file into the living room - we're just talking about things in general, and the talk comes around to taxes. There's a little old woman there - your basic little old woman, short hair, crabby voice, wrinkled face, grey hair - and she's talking about how the new tax things that are going into effect right now are really bad because it looks like you're going to get some sort of a break at first, but then what'll happen is everything will end up being more expensive and you'll end up going backwards. And some of us agree with that [runes? - can't get this] - your general sort of conversation, people nod their heads and say ""uh-huh"", yeah, it's bad; and I was just there, you know, just being neighborly basically."
"210"	"(1/26/88)"	"(After waking up, resetting alarm, and going back to sleep) Alleycat and Tree are watting for me for breakfast - and I hear noises [I think that actually happened once] . I got up and I'm in the ""den"" and notice something's missing. It's the bookcase. It's gone altogether. Somebody must have broken in, but I didn't hear anything. I'm stunned. [After a space of time - don't know what happened] I come into the living room and look around. The usual stuff is gone again - TV [not in the right place] , tape deck, etc. - the bookcases are mostly empty, there's more emptiness in the room than there should be. And I notice the door's standing open - it's bright daylight, not very cold, I'm surprised Alleycat didn't go out. Now that seems very unusual. Seems to me Alleycat would have gone outside, and probably run away. [That's when things started to get mixed up with reality.] I feel sort of shocked, and a little betrayed. I pull the door shut, wondering if this is real or a dream. [I go back to bed?] When I come back into the living room, the front wall has changed to brick and the room is mostly empty. Now I'm really confused. This is still my apartment, isn't it? It looks like the wall of a hall or clubhouse or something - marks on it, corners of posters, worn red brick. I stand next to it, trying to remember if it was brick before and I just forgot, or what's going on here?"
"211"	"(1/27/88)"	"Walking somewhere - not conscious of where, but outside in a non-built-up area, where there are trees and a highway bridge - bit of construction going on, I think. But it's been raining and continues to, and it's flooding. There are some other people walking along here - I think we all have the same goal, more or less, but we're not together. At least I'm not part of the others as a group, but I don't think they're all a group. We're aiming under the bridge (there's no traffic on it), and the water is rising. I guess there's a bit of creek here, and there's a good bit of dirty water rising here. It's not so hard to walk in it, and I wouldn't have chosen this, but there's nothing to be done about it, or to get worried about yet. Now the water's up to my neck, but it doesn't seem to be getting any higher, at least. So we'll keep on slogging."
"212"	"(2/1/88)"	"I'm in a dress shop, upstairs in an open shopping mall and looking at stuff on sale, particularly a heavy sweater [that's a lot like the ones at Emeralds to Coconuts I looked at Thursday after work] . I hold it up to me in front of a mirror and I think it's likely to be too small, but maybe not. So I try it on over my clothes, and actually it does fit, sort of. Maybe it isn't so great, but okay. By the way, there's bright sunshine outside, the light against the big front windows looks yellow. This sweater is kind of boxy, just hip length on me, and it has two yarn drawstrings around it - I know they're meant to be at the waist, but on me they're in the middle of my stomach. I reflect on how this sweater was meant to look on somebody much smaller than me; it wouldn't look just ""okay"" - somebody meant it to look really good, I expect, I've got mindtalk - I shouldn't even have this sweater on - I'm too fat - I should be ashamed of myself. I'm on a street, sidewalk, aiming to catch a bus - it'll be coming soon, but I don't have the 25 cents fare, and I've just about got time to dash down the block to this neighborhood bar I've just been in - I know Chris 's in there, he just came in right before I left, he'll have a quarter. The place is [a lot like the Cedar Pub] in an old house, and all very friendly - lots of jolly people, some playing darts, Sunday-afternoon visiting, that sort of thing. I don't see Chris right away, but I go forward and keep looking - there are different rooms - and run into David Rathvon, who is just as pleased as Punch to see me, and makes a big deal. He is roaring drunk (a very unusual state for him) and says, yeah, sure, he has a quarter, come on in here - going around to one of the side-front rooms, where some of his friends are, and he introduces me all around. There's a separate bar-counter in here, and they've got a free ""buffet"" - which consists of soup (vegetable, I'm sure, reddish in color) and something else in another pot. I figure the object of this is to help calm down the drunks, and somebody does in fact encourage My cousin to have some soup. (It may take 'em a while, from the looks of things.) And he doesn't have a quarter, either, but somebody else offers one and I go on out to make the bus. I'd seen it way down the road when I ran down to the bar, and it's just here now, after I've been inside. [Actually I don't have this clear, but I definitely don't remember missing it.] I'm quite slim, by the way, and I'm wearing a sleeveless yellow flower-print dress, all very spring-y and girlish. I'm not sure I have any shoes on. I've gotten off the bus at some apartments - on my left, they're not new, but quite nice, maybe even elegant. Town-house-y. On my right I see trees, maybe even a park. I'm going to an apartment, I don't know that I live there, but I am at least staying there. A Jeep sort-of-vehicle comes down the street, one of those with sides and trimmings, a removable top. Loretta's in it with a young man, he's driving, he's a lot younger than she is, and very good-looking. Long hair, rather hip but not outrageous. I do think they've got something going on, and I'd like to know more about it. She looks very happy, anyway, and when she sees me, she waves and calls out - they can't stop because of the traffic, and they'll have to drive on a bit and make a U-turn, so they do."
"213"	"(2/19/88)"	"I'm with a group of people - I know most of them, one's Marcy. It's night, and the place is outdoors, but there are some kind of structures like huge sheds that we're in, quite finished out but still rustic. (The word ""manger"" comes to mind.) There's straw on the floor - maybe they most resemble the booths at the Faire. We're here to do something, I don't know what, but there are plans being made, we're getting organized for something. There's actually 2 of these sheds that face each other with some space between. Marcy's father is in one of them, he's quite ill, and there are medical people around for him. I'm near him, and he has some kind of attack or seizure, very serious. The medical attendants come to work on him - I'm trying to be some help, but there's not much I can do. I'm wondering where Marcy is, and if somebody's gone to get her. He could die any time now, and I guess she ought to be here. Well, since I'm just in the way, I'll go on over to the other side. There's a table, and some people (most everybody here is middleaged or elderly, but not all, I think), we're mostly just waiting. Next it's morning, and I'm just getting up - I'm in a house - either my house or Mom and Marcy's, it's a nice, neat, sort of 50's house, not a big place or fancy, but very comfortable and homey. I'm coming down the stairs (enclosed) and I run into Marcy - I almost think she's just coming in from last night, and I don't know what she's been doing, but I don't think she knows her father died. Actually I don't know myself, I'm not clear on what I remember from last night, but I do know he was about to die and couldn't have pulled through the night. I don't quite know what to say to her, in case nobody's told her anything."
"214"	"(2/24/88)"	"Waiting for a bus on a busy downtown street; I have my employee bus pass, homemade like our parking permits, and there's one other thing that I present to the bus driver. I wanted to make a copy of them to use this time, and keep the originals. (The main permit's red like the last parking permits.) There's a copy machine right next to the bus stop, and I see another woman about to use it, which is what reminds me to make the copies. I put my books (and something else) down on the sidewalk to do that. I go ahead of the other woman because she isn't ready (she's kind of a street person - stringy mousy hair, worn face, shabby tan coat) - the machine actually laminates them for you, too - costs a quarter. I go back to the spot where you get on the bus. There's some problem with a pair of my underpants, which I'm carrying in my hand; I drop them and they get mixed up with a small pile of lingerie that belongs to another woman (I don't know why it's there, unless - like my books - she just had to put it down to go do something else, Anyway, the bus comes and I'm fumbling to extricate my underpants, without seeming to be filching her stuff, too, and I have to scramble onto the bus. I put my purse and other things on the sideways seat behind the driver, and show her my copied pass. She's black, looks something like Lynn Moody - she's a little unsure about my pass, and I'm going to show her the original, and discover I haven't picked up my books (and whatever else) off the sidewalk. I say, Oh! hold on a minute, I'll be right back - the doors aren't shut yet - and dash outside to get them. The bus doors shut, and it starts up, slowly at first, almost as if she means to wait for me, then it moves on. I'm stunned - I thought she'd wait for me. I guess she means me to go on to the next stop down the block, but I'm still surprised. I hustle on down, knowing I might still not make it unless I run, and I can't run. But what I find is there isn't another bus stop close by, the bus is heading for the bus shed at the end of the street. I'm really worried, because even if I've got my books, my purse is on the bus, and my bus pass, and there's no way to get home without them. I hurry and reach the shed, which is kind of a main terminal like Union Station was, I guess, and I don't know where the bus is. This end of the place is not where the buses come, and I don't know how you get to the other end. I go through a door that seems to lead further forward, and I pass by what looks to be a locker- and workout-area. A couple of people - bus drivers, I guess, they have that look, like cops and other public servants do, like they have on uniforms even when they don't, who have just come from the showers or are going there - they have towels around their necks. One's a white female, dark hair with a perm, curly top and bottom, not big but physical looking (like bus drivers and cops often are), middleaged. I'm aiming at another door that leads outside and maybe further down towards the other end of the shed."
"215"	"(3/25/88)"	"I'm in the office (old-fashioned, all the desks in one room, more like Texlite was). I keep something in my desk - some papers, a computer printout? - that's a drag to revise - that's supposed to be kept locked up, and Byrdie and I keep the keys (which are shiny new brass keys, bigger like door keys). This other person in the office needs to see this stuff sometimes and Byrdie lends her the key if I'm not here, but the girl who's got that job is new (seems to be Cathy ) and before her there were others - they didn't stay long, and it was quite a nuisance. So now Byrdie's standing here saying ""I think I'll give her my key and then I can get it from her when I need in there."" I don't like this idea - my reaction is like I usually react to Byrdie - disgust, weary, plagued - another of her lame-brained ideas. There's somebody else here, female, I don't know who, but she has an interest in this and she's understanding of the workload in the office. I want her to know I think that giving the key to Cathy is risky, and I say so. I point out that she probably won't even stay very long. And I say, ""I don't mean to actually expect her to leave soon, she only just got here, but after the others I'm just not optimistic."" (Or words to that effect.) It's a pain getting keys made, too. I've been called somewhere by some guys in suits, and they're like CIA or something. I'm supposed to be doing some job for them, or providing information, but I don't know what and I'm rather disgruntled about it. One of them tells me not to worry about it, I'll be informed eventually but not right now. Another scene sort of SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM/Renaissance Fair - I go into a marquee tent on my way outside and Brenda's in there but she doesn't see me - she says to somebody she's been gone 18 months and for some reason she's out of sorts - I'm trying to stay out of her way before I get out."
"217"	"(4/2/88)"	"I'm visiting Carol Burnett and Tim Conway, who are doing Mr Tudball and his secretary for some reason, sort of as a personal thing rather than for an audience. They're staying in this place, which is sort of like an old office building or a factory or warehouse, not currently in use. They've fitted out a couple of rooms as bedrooms, and fixed up part of it as the ""office"" set. And they just are spending their time doing the act - not exactly rehearsing, I don't think, but just being the characters. Anyway, I'm here visiting, and for the moment they're occupied and I'm just wandering around. I look into one of the bedrooms - I think it's Carol's - and I'm rather surprised at how it's furnished. It could be fifty years old, but I know they brought in their own stuff. It's a narrow room with plain walls and an institutional, wavy-opaque glass window on the left side of the far wall. No closet, but there's an old wardrobe on the left-hand wall, a bed on the right. And a nightstand, I guess, maybe a chair or a chest of drawers - anyway, there's only 1 or 2 other pieces of furniture. I like looking at it because of the nostalgia, but it's awfully drab. I go back out, and Carol and Tim have knocked off for a while and we (Carol and I, anyway) are going to walk around some. The ""office"" is left of my perception of the space, and between that and the bedroom is an opening to a hallway and a glass door, where I discover there's a way to the outside. I thought we were on an upper floor, but I guess not. So we stroll outside, and find ourselves in a large city park, at an open space, the sort where people play baseball, or run with their dogs. (The building has disappeared, and Carol Burnett has become Shirley MacLaine.) It's morning, the sun is shining, and there's some people about, not too many. We've been here a while, since early morning and there wasn't anybody here but us. (Counting a man, maybe another, who I can't identify, but who are like assistants - as Shirley MacLaine might even have.) We separate for a bit, just following our noses, and I come up to a large brick/concrete place, some steps, maybe there's a dry fountain, a place to sit or something - terrace-y. Nearer the trees. And suddenly I remember my purse. We left our purses on the ground earlier when we came, since there wasn't anybody around, we just walked off - we weren't going that far anyway, not out of sight. (Though we did spend that time inside the building.) And now here's all these people - I hadn't even realized this was happening. Now I'm scared, and I look for our purses. They're not where we left them - mine's separated from Shirley's - and I get mine, and look into it. It's as I was afraid of, it's all but empty inside. Checkbook, money, coin purse, card case, are all gone. The main section and front pocket are completely empty. I'm horrified and scream, ""Shirley! Shirley!"" And she and the others come running, and I just scream. (No words, not a shrill sound, but deep and from the gut.) I can't stop screaming."
"218"	"(4/8/88)"	"...I'm supposed to be getting on the bus, and I'm just finishing up something - I've been working hard and it's down to the wire and I'm determined not to make a mad dash for it, keep cool, stay in control, don't panic. The front of this place, at least, is a jumble of big things, like it's under construction, and I've left my jacket and purse and one or another things out here, I'd actually almost forgotten that. Everybody else has already gotten on the bus, including George - there's a lot of people I know here - maybe all of them - and we're working here on this big ""project"", I guess, and it's quitting time for the day. I just considered what I was doing crucial enough to stay to finish. But now I see I can make the bus (I think) if I don't waste any time, but I'm not gonna hurry. I collect my things, one by one, and make it to the bus door just as they're closing it. There are 2 guys at the door, bus uniforms, at least the ""doorman"" is black, very businesslike. The ""doorman"" opens the door for me again, and I get on. The bus is huge, and yellow. It's yellow outside and inside the seats might be gold or something, very elegant. This is a new bus, I'd read they were buying new ones, this is a neat thing - the seats are like coach seats, taller, deeper, and the center one of each bank is higher and has some antique-y looking trim. I thought it would be entirely filled up, but there are quite a few seats. I make my way to the back looking for where I want to sit and about the middle of the bus I drop something right next to Eric. As I get down to pick it up I see there's a seat open next to him and I wonder if he'll be disappointed if I don't sit there or if other people will think I should. But I don't want to, I want to sit and be quiet. I go on back - there's a kitchenette/bar on the right - that's neat - nobody doing anything there, though, maybe that's for special events. I find the back seat open (where I usually sit) - there's some litter on the seat, but this is fine. This bus is quite elegant, it's a trip being first ones on it. By the way, as I'm coming up to the bus, just in time: I'm aware that the people on the bus already are anxious for me to make it - there's no calling out or coaching or celebration when I do make it, but I know that they are sort of tensed up, mentally urging me on and there's a feeling of relief when I get there and the man opens the door for me. Earlier: I'm in a house, and there are 2 televisions - a woman and a man are there, and there's a special television show we all want to see. She decides to go to the other TV in another room where she's more comfortable, but (I'm interrupted and come back to find) she hasn't got the channel in clear. I check and discover it's because she changed it by the dial instead of the remote control - she goes to find it and I poke around. I find there are automatic scan switches like the remote has, and try those. It works better, but real slow. I haven't even gotten to that station by the time she gets back. Oh, yes, and in some scene or other I discover that the toe of one of my black boots has come apart - unstuck from the sole, it looks pretty seedy - I will surely have it fixed (it'll cost money, ooh) but right now I'm trying to hide it."
"219"	"(4/11/88)"	"I'm pregnant as a surrogate mother - I'm maybe going to college, I have a lot of friends around who seem to be more or less my age and we seem to be together for something like college, we seem young but not kids. The mother is a friend of mine and I volunteered for this - it was an artificial insemination. Even with me carrying the baby, things are a bit precarious. I'm in the hospital (at least some of the time) because I'm somewhat at risk myself, it turns out. [Something else happens first, and now] it's night and my mom's here, she's getting ready to leave and the nurses and everybody else have gone. I'm kind of scared. It's dark already, the lights are out and my mom leaves. Now what happens if something goes wrong? It's a small, narrow room, looks real institutional, white, white sheets, white iron bed, high ceiling, and there's some kind of machine standing over the bed. I'm worried, and my body feels like something's not okay. After a while, things have changed - there was a problem, and they've transferred the baby from me to somebody else, another of our friends who volunteered. We're not in the hospital room now, but a place that I'm thinking of as a waiting room - it's large and has like couches and things, the light is dim like early morning or late evening but doesn't feel quite like either. The other girl's boyfriend is here, too, he wants to be close to her, help take care of her. And the first girl and her husband(?), and some other people. Actually more of us are arriving gradually until there's quite a lot of people here - all of us good friends, and we all have an interest in this baby. I'm not altogether out of this thing, it's as though I'm still connected, they didn't quite transfer all of the baby to the other girl, I'm still needing to be attended to and cared for even though I don't have to give birth myself. Actually, gradually it seems that we all - at least the women - are carrying ""parts"" of this baby. (Not ""parts"" as in body parts, but some other idea - can't explain it.) We're all quite anxious."
"220"	"(4/15/88)"	"I am somewhere with a group of people, we're working on a project - there are buildings around, but they're farm- or village-type buildings, and we're out in the country. The sun is shining, more or less, it's not beautiful here but ok. The group I'm with is not all together, but we're in one general area and there are other people in the vicinity somewhere. I'm with a girlfriend, close to the end of the space where most of us are, and the buildings are all to the left of my perception, and there's a bit of road going that way. Down the road and past us come some vehicles, one of which is a large piece of equipment, either on a truck or it rolls by itself. It's white and strange-looking. We don't know what it's for, but the whole caravan looks sort of ominous. The people on and in the vehicles seem very somber and serious, not looking round or focusing on anything except going forward. They proceed into (and possibly through) an open building on the other side of the ""village"". (I guess it would have to be like a hangar or something.) My girlfriend and I are extremely curious about this. We look at each other, and decide to go investigate. We sneak up to the building and try to peek in the windows, then duck into an open door after seeing the coast clear. We're looking around (it's rather like a barn in here) but don't see the machine, just stable-y sort of partitions and the straw. It's pretty clean in here for a barn, not smelly, and very quiet. There must be people around someplace, though, and we're being stealthy. My friend thinks these people are Russians and something shady is going on, they're getting ready to pull some dirty deed. She says we could get into a lot of trouble if we were to get caught. She says if we should get caught, we shouldn't give our real names, and I could say mine is ____. I say that's rather complicated, I won't remember it. About this time we do get caught, by a threatening-looking (though attractive) blonde woman, who wants to know our business here. After first being startled, we stumble over some lame explanation and I say my name is ""John"". My friend looks rather surprised and so am I, but it was just what came up at the time. She (the woman) says that's a strange name and I start into some song and dance about how I got it as a nickname as a child. But she doesn't care and she's not at all sure about us, so she says we have to come with her, we'll have to straighten this all out elsewhere. Then she does some things and the back wall opens, showing a (truck?) and a lot of open country - not desert, quite, but pretty barren, and we know that nobody good lives that way. We're bundled into the truck (it's like a troop carrier) and driven away, and I start to panic. I know we're being taken to Russia, and nobody will be able to help us and they'll never believe we meant no harm and they'll never let us go."
"221"	"(5/6/88)"	"I've come to see Trisha but she's not home - I either need to pick something up or leave something. She's living in this smashing house that's not in a residential area but, as if you were in a small town with a small downtown area, like it was near the middle of that, next to like doctors' offices and that. The house is modern, maybe with stone walls or something, very high ceilings, lots of plants hanging and standing, open spaces broken up by dividers. I let myself in to do what I came for and I also need to pee. The toilet is not in its own room but in the bedroom area, and it has an extra lever - I don't know what it's for, but I pull it just to see, thinking it might have a bidet function or something. What it does is let down this fine mist from above, right in front of you as you sit on the toilet. It's very nice but I still don't know what it's meant to accomplish. There's a cat here, too, a nice gray striped one, who comes up to visit. While I'm still sitting, Trisha comes home. I wonder if she'll be okay with me coming like this, but she doesn't mind. (She actually came in very quietly and I was startled when she appeared suddenly.) Her hair is different - she's let the tail loose and maybe gotten a permanent, it's falling to her shoulders, fluffier and curlier - very pretty - I hadn't realized that so much of her hair was braided into the tail. Also while I'm here, Lynnette comes in - we've seen her park her car and come to the house through the big plate glass windows. Trisha tells me she's changed her name. [Can't remember to what.] She just got tired of the old one."
"222"	"(5/13/88)"	"I'm at a Training, in a house-y sort of place, maybe something else, but fairly old. The trainees are in a medium sort of room to my right, and I'm in a sort of team room, narrowish, no windows, yellowish light from fixtures - counters and chairs and stuff suggest the 30's or 40's. I'm having to do dinner for the trainers - John Boats and another unidentified man - and I'm in a bind because there isn't any food. I don't know how this situation came about, but it is and I'm pretty upset about it. For the last meal (it was just John) I had to cook one of my sweaters, and I don't want to do that again. I've got another one, a light green, I think it has a turtleneck, and I really like it, I don't want to give it up. I'm standing with it in my hands in front of the [cooker?] and feeling real sad. The only alternative is to go out and spend money, which I also don't want to do - I don't have much - but as I stand here I also realize how poor it would be to give them a cooked sweater again. I just can't do it. Damn. So I go to get my purse, which is in another room - the door leads into the back left corner of the room - and dash quietly across the corner to another door. This leads into a corridor, which has a telephone alcove in the middle and a door underneath. I think I had put my purse in the cabinet, but when I try to open it I find another door underneath - I know I haven't seen that before. So I go down to the room at the end of the corridor and retrieve my purse [my real one] where I left it on a table. (There's someone else in the room, and I'm aware that she/he would give me support if I wanted it, but I don't say anything.) I dash back across the training room (it reminds me somewhat of a Victorian parlor, and it's dim - only the trainers and trainees are in here, no staff) and back into the ""team room""-sort-of-place. [When I wake I'm feeling really sad and down from all this, can't say why, but the feeling is very heavy.]"
"223"	"(5/13/88)"	"I've been on a bus on my way to work and I get put off part way there when the bus breaks down. It's a hill, somewhat south of town, and I can see the space between. I'm late, of course, and going to be later. I'm nervous about that and decide to turn back rather than go in so late. Now I'm at my father and My stepmother's house - I seem to be staying here. It's a regular sort of suburban house. I don't have a key with me and I don't know if I can pick the lock or break the door in - and I don't want to be seen breaking in, but it turns out if I just jiggle the handle a bit and lift sideways, it opens - the lock parts are loose. [I go inside but I don't remember what I do there - something to do with the telephone.]"
"224"	"(5/13/88)"	"I'm watching a film or tape taken from a helicopter, I suppose, of a city skyscraper all the way up to the roof where a singer - maybe an opera singer - is performing, singing to the sky in an evening dress. The ""camera"" passes over her and continues, showing the tops of other high buildings. [Some other things happen.] Now I'm in a car on a hill - it's night, been night all along - and I'm crying because I'm afraid to go up that high, I couldn't do what the singer was doing. The person I'm with hugs and consoles me."
"225"	"(5/15/88)"	"I'm living in this little cabin-y sort of house with the cats, and Linda's coming over later to go out [just as we'd planned] but I think I'll go for a walk or something, even though I have doubts about leaving. I live near a park sort of area with a creek and trees and people come there for fun, but it doesn't have facilities or signs. I go up this way and spend some time before I run into this girl. She's got short dark hair and is wearing slightly butch clothes - reminds me of Renee. She starts a conversation about the time I decide to go back, and keeps on asking me questions about myself. I think she wants me to say I'm gay but won't ask directly, and I'm just not volunteering the information. She follows me almost all the way back home before giving up (or I shake her, however it was). I'm a bit late getting back and Linda is already there with some other people, maybe a sister of hers and the sister's kids (teenagers), something like that. Something seems to be bothering them and I suddenly get scared that somebody's broken into my house again. I open the door carefully and look around, but everything's in place. They bustle around the way families will and I try to get it together so we can go where we're going. One thing is to get a bunch of stuff out of my purse that I've accumulated. This includes 3 different kinds of Band-Aids in tins, which fall over in the back compartment and the Band-Aids fall out. I'm real annoyed at this and the more I try to get them out easily without getting all mixed up, the more mixed up they get. I keep whining, ""Damn"" or ""Shit"" every time something shifts - not very entertaining for the guests but I'm pretty frustrated and don't care. To add to the problem, somehow I spill water into my purse, which will ruin everything. ----I get organized finally and we leave - we go somewhere like a museum, where we've seen something and there are attendants around and on the way out we get sort of hung up talking to them - I have some sort of problem getting my shoe or some part of my clothes caught on something on a man who's with us. There are more of us now, including Lynn and Dan - we're actually doing something besides visiting, we're using what we've just seen in some way. The blonde daughter is trying to hurry us up so we can get started with our project, which involves portable computers - we're setting them up in the lobby, sitting on the couches there and working at something - but mine isn't working right. It's taking some of the numbers I've put in and repeating them elsewhere on the screen at odd angles, where they fade and drift off the screen. I clear it and start again, but it does the same thing - I tell the others and they share my concern that if it's the computer that's doing it, it could damage my disk. One more try - it gets worse, finally putting all sorts of random numbers on the screen. Later I'm at Lynn and Dan's house with Tree - we've gone into the back yard (it's night) and Tree gets out of the house and runs across the yard and I run to catch him."
"226"	"(6/13/88)"	"I'm coming up to a sort of rocky ledge with a low (natural?) wall - all around there's sky, huge and beautiful. There's a mountain range in the distance. The colors are all yellowish and there's a sort of early-morning feel. It's not warm, but it's not real cold either. Somehow I know this either is Tibet, or we're coming to it. Down beneath the wall are a couple of flowers growing. They're very sturdy, thick-leafed, the kind of petals that start out green first, and shaped something like hyacinths. I think I'll eat one but I see it isn't fully developed yet. There's another, though, with a wider shape to it and quite thick (you might say meaty) rather than made up of lightweight petals, and I pull that and take bites of it. As I do (it doesn't really have much taste, by the way, but it's substantial) I find that buried in it is a small saucerlike bit of pottery, standard white-glazed with a flower pattern round the edge, much like diner dishes - I pull it out and see that it's the foot of a sort of vase or stemmed dish we'd found around here shortly before and we'd wondered where the foot was. It seems that the flower just grew around it. We go on. Soon we get to civilization of a sort. We're in a stairwell of a building I can tell is massive, and the scene is mostly dark, as if it were night, and we were seeing outside through windows, but we're not - on the left (facing down the stairwell) is a huge wall, and it shows a magnificent scene [although right now I can't remember what of, or even what it looked like - it may have even been an outdoor landscape, as if there were a window there. I halfway think the wall in front, on the stairwell, was indeed a window. But I'm not sure.] To the right is an open door into a lighted room, and people - not in large numbers - keep moving up and down the stairs and into and out of the room. They're all Orientals, these people, dressed in native clothes, the long coats, the hats with round stand-up brims, the slipper shoes. I'm aware that this place is equivalent in some respects to a shopping mall - of course, plain and simple, it is one, it has lots of vendors selling things that people want and need, all under one roof; but there's some fundamental difference in it, too. These people are taking the thing more seriously, for one thing. And it isn't set up intentionally for fun - though there are some neat things about it. The left-hand wall, for instance: at first I thought I was looking at (something, whatever it was!) really magnificent and elaborate. But now something has shifted - either it's done this on purpose, or my viewpoint has changed, but I see now that the whole thing is painted, an illusion. A bloody good illusion, but nevertheless not what I thought it was. Now that I know that, it bothers me - the whole situation bothers me. I'm not sure what to do next. At the same time, what's occupying my mind is the observation of this ""shopping-mall"" business. The idea of the mall is sort of ""new"" to us here, but when you think about it, there's nothing unusual about it except that we started building malls in places where there were already plenty of stores to be found. Elsewhere, stores are still grouped collectively for the convenience of the shoppers, but they have to come from farther away and do more business at a time. That's why there were fairs and street markets. It wouldn't be any sillier to build a regular mall in Tibet than in Texas, for heaven's sake. If people want to buy things, why wouldn't they do it in a mall just as easily as from rickety booths on the street? I'm on a city bus with several people from yoga class - I guess we've just left a class - including George and maybe Cynthia. I've got my purse and something else with me, which I stow on the seat. This is [another] ""funny"" bus - has its seats placed differently from regular buses, and it's up high like the out-of-town-coaches. We're all in a pretty fun mood, and we bowl along through a pretty part of town, with big trees and nice streets, older houses and occasional stores and offices. At one point the bus is diverted by road works from its regular route, and we turn to the left. Then, because of the diversion, we have to drive through a building - actually it's a lot like the Central area Pharmacy except it's got a garage attached. There's 2 sections to it. You can pull in the front or the back - the front is a bit more finished, with matching red brick to the store - you can enter the store from there. The back is different, with painted walls, a little more garage-like. The bus stops in the front; it's going to wait there to catch up to its schedule, and we all pile out of it to stretch our legs and look around. This is a place we know anyway, but it's neat. There's a sort of art exhibit in the back section, various things stuck up on the wall as if a children's school class had done them. Sue S is here (suddenly - I don't remember her being on the bus) and she's looking at them with us. And Tree is here, too - this place is only a short distance from where I live - on the street in back, matter of fact - and he's been exploring down here, I guess. He's come in the back door (both are open), and I pick him up and show him to the people. Actually I'm surprised he's letting me do that, and I'm keeping a good strong grip because he's beginning to get twitchy - but Sue and some others say, oh, what a pretty kitty, and I make up my mind to just go on home with him from here since we're so close, without waiting for the bus. I have to go back in to get my stuff, though. [And I suppose I put Tree down because he wasn't with me for the next part.] I climb up and go to get my purse and things, but while I'm here the bus starts to move. I guess it must have been left in gear or something because it starts going right on out and across the street (the entrance faces another street), and carries on for a couple of blocks. It stops eventually because it runs up against something, I guess, but it's a bit precarious. I can see that the street is going a bit downhill and if it starts to roll again it'll be hard to stop. I get out very carefully and go around to the front, thinking I might push it backward off of the incline, if I can (it's not such a big bus at the moment, you see - it seems like a possibility). But it's just barely starting to move again, and I give it a push, but no go - oh dear. I leap out of the way and remember I still haven't got my things, so I jump back on. The bus gathers momentum and rolls onward, down a street and around a curve and finally comes to rest somewhere, no particular damage done. I am joined now by a little guy in a rather exotic outfit - he's not quite midget-sized, but definitely well below average. (Rather good-looking though - dressed up sort of like, you might say, a warrior-elf. Maybe that's what he is. He's got on some sort of blue loincloth affair, and boots - dark hair, not too long - looks tough but still cute.) (I don't know where he comes from, but I'm not shocked to find him there - maybe he was hiding inside or something - I'm sure he didn't come in from outside.) We discuss the situation, which is more involved than it looks - we need to contact somebody for help. We can't handle this bus on our own (it's become something more like a spaceship now, and much larger), we know there's normally a crew of 2 men to run it, and we can't just leave it where it is and go. (I don't know why.) We poke around some, and find the radio to call the central-whatever with, and send a message to send help. That done, we banter around some more - this all seems like a rather fun adventure - and sort of get cozy. He proposes having sex, right there in the cabin, and I think it sounds like something of a lark, and say yes - I've never had sex with an elf before, for sure, and it might be very different, who knows? We've got nothing better to do till the rescue party gets here, although we don't know when that'll be. [Actually a fair amount of time has passed already.] Suddenly, as he moves over me lying on the floor, he gets bigger - much bigger. He sort of stretches out till he looms over me, and I don't like it. I say so, and next he reaches beyond me over my head to a shelf where he's put something to be handy. It's a kind of face-mask, only it's made of beads (not fine little round beads but cylindrical mostly, they're white and red, maybe orange and yellow too) and it fits over his chin loosely, like a beard. The look on his face has gone very serious, the way you do when the playful part of sex gives way to the other feelings. At that moment, the ""crew"" sent out from the central office arrives. We break apart in a hurry, as you might imagine, and explain who we are, and what happened. There are 2 men and a woman, they look very cold and matter-of-fact, but ask us to help (by doing something, but I don't remember what - it involves looking around the ""ship""). I go ""downstairs"" - toward the front of the place we're in - you might call it a cockpit - it no longer looks like a bus, there's a wall behind, very ""ship""-like - there are stairs, or a ladder to the next level. I hadn't even realized this was here. There's a bathroom down here, good, I need one, and go across the room towards it, but a man goes into it before me, so I have to wait. Now I'm confused. Who is this guy, and how did he get here before me? Is he one of the Tree that just arrived, and got here by another stair? Or has he been down here the whole time? If so, why didn't he say anything? Is he hiding? Oh, well, I'll just wait."
"227"	"(7/1/88)"	"With MacGyver and a little girl - she's in danger, we're all escaping from the bad guys. Went through a church at one point, like the back hallways, passed by at least one clergyman, typical black suit - just sort of said hi on the way downstairs. Outside on the street, there's some kind of festival going on, and we're dodging the bad guys by disappearing into the crowd. We wind it up, finally, getting away altogether or something, and we're in a room in what I think is a little house. There's a window and a couple of beds, we're tired and emotionally exhausted. Turns out the kid doesn't actually have anywhere to go, and we've all bonded in this whole thing; MacGyver says he wants her to stay with him, and she wants to, they'll be like father and daughter. I'm feeling very left out since I don't fit into this scene - I'm not Mother, and I'm not his girlfriend or lover, that's not what I want from him. What I want is for him to be my daddy too - I really hurt at the idea of being on my own with no one to love me. I go over to the bed he's on (sort of just relaxing back, not sitting sideways or actually lying down) and kneel by it - I can't speak, I'm so full of longing and sadness and pain I don't even know how to say what I want, so I just stay there looking at the floor."
"228"	"(7/25/88)"	"On a trip, I think - possibly England, with My ex and a couple other people driving up a country road to one place and it's either not the place we thought it was, or we can't go there and get, or we can't go there at all,...so we return back down this road, to I guess the place that we're staying, and the other couple go somewhere else and My ex stays with me, at least for a while - it's as though I need taking care of in some way - either (I'm) tired and being tucked in, or I don't feel well, I'm being _____ up to sort of lay back and rest, or something - I have a sense of it being not feeling well, but I do have this being taken care of...The next thing is that I go out from there and there is a string of libraries around here - it's a very interesting setup - there's this large ""grounds"" and it's being revitalized, refurbished anyhow, and they have had libraries on this spot for a while, but they've been building even more of 'em. This is the library system, in these several buildings - why you'd have all the branch libraries in one place is quite beyond me, but that's how it was - basically, they'd taken all the branch libraries and moved them to this spot and they're set out in a string, very much like a train; they're different styles; some of them are - there's at least one under construction right now, and some of them are quite new, a few of them are oldish, but none of them are very old - and what with all of the remodelling and new building being done, I'm just wanting to have a look at them and I've nothing better to do at the moment, and that's what I'm doing. So I go, I guess... it's a little bit across from this string, and - it's got something in it, luggage (there's something about that that rings a bell), and so I go like to the first one on the left end, and beyond that, across the field (because this is all grass there aren't paths that go up to it - to my left, there's the entrance to something like an amusement park, that is also being remodelled and refurbished - and I go on in - you have to go up some steps or something (it gets more like a train as I think about it), and I just wander through, and look at different things, and in fact, what I've got here is not really much like a library - there aren't a whole lot of books here, and I'm even aware that this is unusual, I mean having a library without so many books, or is it just an illusion that that's what I'm in? It's... very comfortable, there's lots of lounge-type seating around, and it reminds me of a hotel, or a train, again; people are simply here to relax rather than to do research or anything like that - largely gentlemen sitting around reading the newspaper - not really a library... there are rooms that have nothing whatsoever to do with libraries - there are bedrooms, - kitchens (of course we do have kitchens, but not like this) - and about the 3rd room or so, I run into Byrdie. I didn't expect her to be here, and she's kinda doing the same thing I am, just checking things out...and she allows as how we should continue our tour together, or end it - I hadn't planned to stop here, but she says... so, I can't really say no, so we get off... I get myself separated from her, without any special effort to - just sort of drift off - and then I run into Lyn , and he offers me a ride home - or a ride back to wherever he's staying anyway - and I accept, and we get into the car and drive off, and once again I realize I don't very much want to be with Lyn. And also I'm aware that I left my car behind, and this is gonna be pretty awkward tomorrow. He'll have to bring me back out here to get it, which is not real practical. And I spend a few minutes deliberating on whether I should annoy him by telling him we have to go back, when he's already got me this far, and then I decide it just isn't workable anyhow, and so I tell him,... and he drives me back to it. And he's not mad - quite reasonable, after, and I get back in and I drive back to where he's staying - and there is, I think the original 4 of us, and the house actually belongs to an old woman, and she's staying there too and she's kind of in charge (I'm not sure which). It's late when we get back, everybody's asleep by now, and this woman is not the friendliest person in the world... but there's something about her that's not so much fun and I don't want to wake her up... I decided I'm gonna watch a movie on video, which seems to be ""Willow"", but isn't really - I'm sure there are some elements of it - [I seem to have some images of the real characters that are on it, but] the way the movie ends up, I think that there is a Darth Vader in it, somewhere, and actually the space capsule, being shot up - I keep thinking of explosion - in a city, specifically, there's a bridge over a river, and you see the skyscrapers and whatnot in the background, and on the left bank as you're facing... there's a round space-capsule type of thing, and he shoots it up into space - or into the air, anyway, I'm not sure where it's actually going - it's not actually meant for space travel, but... here on earth; and that's where the movie ends. And then they start rolling the credits. Now, before the movie gets to this point, a bunch of people wake up; and I have - this is a kind of parlor in front of the house, and there are lots of bedrooms - and it turns out that there is, like, a band of gypsies actually staying there. This was a sudden kind of arrangement, and the woman that I was talking about, and everybody else, practically, in the house has been waked up. And it's not by the movie, I don't think, maybe just the continuing sounds of somebody coming in and having the movie on and they're all gradually waking up and coming to investigate what it is, what's going on, finding it's me and go back to bed. One of 'em, a woman, doesn't; she - these people may be gypsies - I think they're also part of the circus - and they're not all dark-gypsy-stock sort of people. This woman's blonde (not very - she's a kind of mousy, dishwatery-blonde sort of person) and she seems to have a kind of German accent, maybe? And she's wanting to talk. [At the moment I'm not remembering what she wants to talk about.] She's asking me these ""chatty"" questions, in a sort of Slavic accent, and I'm really not wanting to talk to her, I'm wanting to watch the movie, and I answer a couple of her questions, you know, polite and all that, and then I notice - I've noticed the music continuing for a while now, and I've noticed the movie is over and the credits are rolling, which kinda ticks me off, and so I say to her, ""Look, actually, I wanted to see the end of this movie"", and I reach over and push the buttons to rewind it and it starts rewinding visibly on the screen, and so she goes away and actually it's as if somebody else comes in, I'm not really sure. And the same kind of thing happens, another time, although quite briefly and I get distracted again, rolling the movie forward; I realize I've missed the explosion again. I wanted to see the space capsule shoot up in the air, and so finally, (he) goes away or it quiets down and I get to actually look at it, and I see that happen, then the credits roll, and it's just credits - names rolling across the screen, and so forth, and then hearing the music, [and at this moment I can't tell you that it was the actual music from ""Willow"", but it was nice,,... movie music, and that's what my mind says it was, and then I wake up.]"
"229"	"(8/19/88)"	"I've been at the Fair, it's a bright sunny day outside of town, and Jenny is driving us home - I think there's 1 or 2 other people with us (maybe 1 male, 1 female). We're going down a road near the freeway, eventually to meet up with it, but we run into a lot of construction vehicles. It's only the very beginning stages of something, but these large vehicles are over and around the roadway, the land all around has been flattened; but there are no Keep Out signs or barriers, so Jenny just drives straight on up. We're thinking maybe this isn't such a good idea, but the majority of them are moving off the pavement, you can see that it isn't busted up, there's no reason we can't drive on it - but is the end of the road clear, to the next street? I'm sure we're not supposed to be doing this, but as soon as the last vehicle moves out of the line of vision, we see the rest of the road is still ok, and Jenny drives on through. I'm looking at my arm (right forearm). There seems to be something written on it, but on the underside and I can't quite get a look at it yet. We did get our hands stamped at the door, but that was the left hand; now what's this? I remark this to the others, who look, and we finally see it's a map of the fair, colorful, with humorous stuff on it. It's actually a T-shirt transfer that I seem to have gotten stuck on my arm, presumably leaning over some of them. I'm back at home now - I live in a house with my father and stepmother (I'm still pretty young, maybe 18 or 20), and they're not home. I go out in the back yard, which is phenomenal - it's big, and all dug up like an excavation. There are mounds of red earth and little cliffs, and open pits. One of my friends comes to tell me there's a kitten out here in trouble - it's lost and found its way in here and can't get out. We find it - it's not in too good shape - and take care of it. Back in the house, I'm in the kitchen (right end of the house as you look from back to front) and going toward the den-living-room areas when I pass by a small room glassed in like a listening booth, and one of my friends is in there. He's telling me my parents are coming in, warning me not to go into the living room. (This is not a major thing, just information - what emotion there is is not a big fear, but it's as though I'm used to it. ""Oh, yeah, right, you don't go in there if your parents are coming in, you stay out of the way."") I did see them come through the door, My stepmother in her big red wool coat with a head scarf and Dad looking like he used to. I just faded back to my bedroom (left side of the house). My room is sort of shadowy. The outside light is fading now, and the sky graying over too. There's a big long window with drapes here, over my dresser, on the front wall of the house, and I open the drapes to look at the view. There's all of downtown right smack in front of the window, all these tall buildings and skyscrapers. We seem now to be high up in the building, as if this is an apartment. As I watch, I see several flying cars, oh boy! Flying cars are quite new, and expensive of course, and you don't see so many of them. These must have been at the Renaissance Fair. They're all pretty big - one of them is a very substantial-looking station wagon and one's a Jaguar (white, not real big but not a D- or E-type either). I rush around to tell the others to go look at them, and they all go to other windows to see, and the sun's even broken through again, a lovely golden sunset on the rooftops and shiny buildings and the cars. Back in my room, the sun's gone in again, but the cars are still pretty neat. There's even a little San-Francisco-type cable car. They all look so grand, drifting easily through the sky. Now I'm outside, some of us are driving through town, still looking up at the flying cars, and there's a white bus or something off to my right, I can only see the top of it, though it's higher than we are - there are trees around it. I was thinking that's awfully big to fly, and then it becomes clear that it isn't, it's on the ground, just higher up on a hill. We get to another apartment, and we're there for a Training. Lloyd's here, this may be his place, and the trainees are here too, sitting in the living room. I talk to Lloyd for a bit - he sure is talking funny, very animated and enthusiastic, not like usual. I go into ""my"" bedroom. I'm not sure if I've just switched houses, or if I'm moving in here, but I do have my jewellery and other things here. They're not all organized, dumped on the bed, and things need to be sorted and put in the closet (just to the left of the bed - a real standard bed; in fact, both of these bedrooms are very motel-sort-of furnished, nondescript dressers and low metal-frame beds without headboards, dark industrial bedspreads, no ornaments). [I go back out and come in again for a rest; I mean to lie down on the bed.] Sherry is in here, with an older woman. They're chatting. Sherry says to me, ""I don't know how you find anything with your stuff all scattered around like that - we just sorted all your jewellery for you and put it away."" I say, ""I was gonna do it soon, you know I've only just moved in here, and I haven't had time."""
"230"	"(8/29/88)"	"First scene: I'm at an SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM event somewhere outside, but with buildings, smallish, like park buildings; the ground is not level where I am - this may be a tournament, probably is, but I'm not where the event is currently happening. I'm actually returning from it, walking away from whatever the action is, back to fetch something from (my own cabin? or tent? or elsewhere?) or maybe not. There's an element of leaving but it not being public knowledge. I may be with someone else, another female. On the way I pass by a couple of gentlemen (we're all dressed up, these two are quite fine, the one who seems to be superior is dressed mainly in black, quite Renaissance with puffed sleeves, white shirt, puffed hat and pants). We don't say anything to each other beyond ""Good day"" or something. I'm going uphill. Second scene: A large resort/summer camp, lots of people here, lots of each, visitors and staff. Staff are like graduates or something, who've been here a lot, and act a lot like seniors in high school, sort of superior, swaggering, smart-aleck, but not too serious. I'm new, with a bunch of girlfriends, just checking in and getting oriented. We walk across to this building that might be a dining hall, with a screened porch/entry. (The sun is shining, quite bright, it's nice here, a beautiful summer day in the woods - there may be a lake in the distance. The place has rather large buildings for a camp, typical white-sided wooden.) Inside we run into Bruce Willis, who is on staff here - he's doing his familiar smartass number, trying to impress us, and he talks particularly to me, and asks me for a date. I'm not sure I heard him right, and he says, ""Yeah, right, I mean it, you and me (something or other)"". I'm surprised and pleased. Third scene: Perhaps an extension of the last one - I've left the camp in a car with a couple of other people, a man and a woman. We may be returning to the city on purpose, or maybe we're just out for a ride and decide to come this way, but withal we're aiming at downtown Dallas from the west, across the Trinity [the names were not used in the dream] , and find our way blocked. At first we find the road we're on doesn't go through; then I suggest going on north a bit, where I know we can get through. But as we do that, we come to another dead end. At some point in this, it becomes a chase. Someone is after us, I don't know who. We have to stop at this old building that might have been a plant or any number of other things, it's brick, institutional-looking. I've gone to schools with aspects like this. The back of it is where we are, with no door at ground level, but there's one down below, where there's a (former) set of concrete stairs from ground level and a retaining wall. Except that the stairs have been covered up to keep people from coming down here. It looks as if they poured concrete or something to fill them up, and smoothed off the top. Then there's something black and tarry/greasy on top of that. But it looks like the only thing to be done, get down there and try to get in the door. The guy goes down first, sliding down like on a ramp. He has now turned into Bruce Willis. The other woman goes, and now it's my turn and I don't want to; I have my white dress on and that black stuff will ruin it. Oh, hell. But there's no help for it, so down I go. We get inside, it's a match for the outside, dark, dirty, old, unused. Fourth scene: (Continuation) I'm with Bruce in this place, [we don't seem to have any plans except to hide out] and a bunch of college students come in. I can't say what it is, but there's something not right about them, like sinister, and some of the time they refer to college in terms that better describes a church. In fact, one of them says ""the church"" instead of ""college"" once. Bruce is suspicious and wary, wound up in case something happens. I'm nervous and wanting to be held and comforted. I snuggle up against him [wherever it is that we're sitting together] , wriggling as if to get behind him. He doesn't like it."
"231"	"(9/2/88)"	"I'm on top of 2 square tables, way up in the air. The table tops are like the ones we have in the staff rooms at the library - only they're on these long poles, I guess they're embedded in the ground but I can't see. [Estimating in real time, I may be 3 stories or more in the air.] I'm outside, what I can see is lawn and there are some trees nearby but I'm not looking around. Down below is a living-room chair upholstered in a print of some sort, and Donald from the Water Department is sitting in it. What's going on is some kind of test, or teaching-thing, like part of a workshop, where this is a physical challenge like the ""ropes"" or something. I'm the last one to do this, out of a group of people I mostly know. They've mostly gone, [I don't know whether they've gone home or inside somewhere - this seems like a huge backyard, or the grounds to a large house or building] and I can only see Donald and one other girl, who's finishing something up and getting ready to leave. [I don't know how I got up here, but I'm laying down on the table tops on my stomach.] I'm in that sort of repressed-panic state, where I know I'm scared but I'm not allowing myself to scream or express it; just wide-eyed stunned apprehension. I'm mostly on one of the table tops and I roll over to sort of straddle the center and hold onto both equally. I'm looking down at Donald and he's looking back at me - he's not actually saying anything right now, but what he's there for is to be my partner, or support, and I'm not sure what that means but he'll definitely be here while I'm up here. That helps. [I'm not aware of anything I'm supposed to do while I'm here except stay put, but I'm pretty sure I'm expected to do something besides just wait it out.] Just now I'm beginning to wonder if these tables will sway (like you might expect them to), or maybe separate under me and I'll be in a pretty awkward position."
"232"	"(10/4/88)"	"I'm standing in front of a pantry [?] ...as opposed to the kind you walk into, I think I meant...small closet in the kitchen, in a small house. The cat food is supposed to be at the bottom, on the floor of this pantry, in a rubber container, kinda like the cat litter**. What's here, at the moment, is there's cat food scattered on the floor where it's been left, as a mess. But dry cat food is stacked, if you will - really - on the right side next to the wall, as though, you might imagine, there would be a dispenser or something - but the dispenser isn't there any more, and it's in the same position. And I'm scooping up the bits, just to neaten things up, and I also notice some yellow liquid on the floor. [?] And I check it out, I'm assuming that it's cat pee, and I'm assuming that Alleycat did it, and I'm taken aback. When I check it out, touch it, it turns out to be oily and it doesn't smell, and what it turns out to be is dripped oil from one of the bottles on a lower shelf, on the floor. Things are generally kind of messy here. Now, the reason this is unusual is that in the other room, Bettye is talking to a guy that has just cleaned this place. He's kind of on the dark and swarthy side, kind of stocky, burly. He has just taken over from the guy who was doing it before, and his price is in question. It was kind of like George's thing; he had a price, raised the price, somebody else came in and lowered the price. It was like $25 to $35, and $30; and now this guy wants $33, and Bettye is hesitant about it - she's not wanting to give him 33, and there's something in it about she doesn't actually have it - I mean, she does have it, but we're kind of stretching around here. And he's explaining to her, you know, how things are, and that he needed the extra $3, and he's sort of implying that it was more work here, or something. But then in fact what I'm seeing is that he's not doing as good a job. There's like, what I'm seeing in this pantry, and elsewhere. I'm in the pantry, overhearing this, feeling kinda guilty, because of the cat food and stuff, thinking that it's my fault and that I ought to be taking part, you know, kicking in for the money - or more, anyway - I'm not actually sure how we distribute it. Bettye is kind of the head of the household, and in some respects she's running this particular thing. I kind of think Bettye is a substitute, too. And where we are is something on the order of a college neighborhood and I have just previously been in @ a scene in a place that's something like a dorm, only it's not in a building, it's like a cabin, more-like arrangement, where you're on the ground floor anyway, and have a porch, and I'm outside on the porch trying to communicate with my mother through one of those wooden necklace-things that I got from the Library Store, the Philippine things. We discovered that we could talk to each other over them; and I may be looking at this place wanting to rent it - maybe even for both of us. (Not real sure about that.) But I go out on the porch, and I seem to be facing a big group of buildings, they're kind of like Fair Park, or a college - THE UNIVERSITY just crossed my mind, too - and the atmosphere is interfering, or something; I speak to her once, and we make connection, and then I'm talking and I realize that she's not answering back, and then I can't hear the same sound that I had, and I try to get her back, and it's not working. There's a guy here, present, and I don't know what his involvement is right now, but he's part of this. He's a young, nice-looking guy, tall, dressed casually. (I don't know what I'm doing with him, exactly.) ***There was also another communication problem earlier; I kept trying to call this other [Elsa's? offices?] extension, I think it was my mother, on the office phones - there's even a switchboard here of some description, and I keep getting a wrong number. I haven't looked it up to verify what it is, and I keep being absolutely sure I've got it, and I call, get the wrong number, hang up immediately, and the person on the other end of the line is very angry. Or somewhat angry, anyhow - and the last time, even starts to threaten that she's going to call somebody to investigate. She names a party - not the police, and not the telephone company, I don't think; but in any case I'm certainly alarmed about this - not that logically, she can actually trace a call that was like that, when all it is, is just a brief connection and then hanging up - so, I don't know what that's about."
"233"	"(10/5/88)"	"I'm sitting in a cafe with a couple of other - I think women - yeah - and we're next to the window, on the street - we're in a booth. And there's a factory, or some sort of plant, across the street (it's not a very wide street). There's an alarm going off in the place across the street, and somehow I know that the thing is gonna blow up - or something's gonna blow up over there, and it's all very ominous. Nothing is actually happening right away, but [...?...] then suddenly there's a light in one of the sections closest to the street, really not precisely where I thought things were gonna be happening from, and - it's funny, it's as if I can see this happening even though I'm getting under the table - we decided it would be the better part of valor to duck. The light starts out small, and then grows to a flash, and then something goes boom, and then we say ""Uh-oh"", and crouch down under the table. And we cover our heads with our arms, like we did when we were in school, anyhow, and I'm not entirely sure this is gonna do the trick 'cause it's liable to be a pretty big explosion."
"234"	"(10/8/88)"	"I'm talking to Wayne, we're at work but it looks neither like the real office or the real library. The whole place is open and people bustle around - though it's not crowded - I'm reminded of a newspaper. Anyway, I've caught him for a moment and explain how I'd like to combine the parking lists into one file (it seems he does something with parking himself and that contributes to it being awkward) so it can be a lot more efficient and easier to use. He's dubious about this, but says, yes, well, okay, I guess, we can do that...other kids, one girl, one boy. The girl was sitting at the desk before, (we're close to the left-hand wall) but got up a while ago, and I'm working with some stuff off to the left of it. It's awkward, and I move it up to the center of the desk and sit up at it. She's coming back, and I ask her if she needs to be here, but she says no, and I ask some question about what I'm doing and she helps me out. [She is or reminds me of somebody but I can't place her - I keep thinking of Gail , but it's more than that - probably a combination of people but there's something nagging at me about it. A particular name that should be there.] There's a computer here, she's been using it, and I think I'll poke at it a bit, but I can't get the hang of what she'd been doing. She shows me, it's something like, hit ""a"", then ""b"", then ""a"", ""b"" again, etc., then maybe ""c"", but I don't get it right. I'm frustrated. [ - the way I was over the dBase the other day, when I was wanting to do something with the parking lists.] I'm in a car, with a couple of other girls, on our way to a ""fair"" - seems like a State Fair, and we're going to be on ""team"" rather than just going to it. As we pull into the parking area for participants, we meet some others and get out of the car. Shortly a group of other vehicles shows up and blocks us in on all sides - the car, I mean - and when I want to get something out of it I can't get to it without climbing through a truck - I look all around and get thwarted each way, then climb through. Shortly after, I'm with several others in a place a bit beyond the cars, where we're hanging out and sitting around on various things. I'm on something suspended like a swing from some structure - it's not really supposed to be a swing but it moves like one and I'm just perched on it and getting it to move back and forth, it's fun - I keep going higher, possibly not a good idea - liable to knock into something. But I keep doing it, using body English to get it moving the way I want, and now I jog a little bit and start swinging in a wide arc to the left. I certainly didn't mean to be going this far, but I don't seem to be able to stop. I'm not going all that fast - as a matter of fact it's almost like slow motion - but I'm rather high up and there's nothing to grab onto or jump off onto. As I swing backward, I have to be careful not to slam into some screens that are on the back of where we are - there's a fence, but the screens form some sort of structure that would be quite awkward to explain if they got busted up. I can reach out and slow myself down and keep out from them, but I keep on going and bump into some other stuff all the way behind, and I come to the apex of the swing and go back the opposite direction. Coming back to the front, I go past where I started and swing over to the right, where I bump into a piece of furniture, it's like a sideboard/hutch or something, old, weathered, and I don't knock it down, but stuff on it, and maybe something next to it. Glenda is standing at it, she's doing some chore there or other, and she doesn't get excited or even react, but I know she doesn't approve. I just look at her sheepishly. Otherwhere [this may have been on the way to the fair, maybe not] , I'm in a car, the place is in a town, an old place, very close in, very ethnic, a lot of adobe or some such substance. We get stopped by a cop* on some technical thing, and he lets us off with a warning after we explain it was something we didn't know or couldn't help. I can see across the intersection the tail end of a small parade, going down a sort of alley - walls on each side. What I see is some people dressed like Middle Eastern types, robes, turbans, sandals, and a donkey or two, with leaves or something hanging off of them. Later on, I'm in the car, next to the passenger door, somebody in between, my father's driving, and there's a couple of others in the back seat. We get stopped again by the same cop, he's tall, male, and black, a nice guy, sort of a park ranger type. (Probably not the same thing we got stopped for before, but also a technicality.) However, he's got to be someplace else, and he turns us over to another cop, who is a white, blonde woman with curly hair."
"235"	"(10/19/88)"	"I'm in a sort of lobby, or part of a store, an old-looking place (I can't see what furniture there is, but there is something in the space - not high, but lower than waist level anyway - probably some chairs) - maybe as old as 100 years, but could be anything up to the Forties - darkish, daylight outside - as if it were hot outside and you leave the lights off to keep it cooler? Anyway, I've come in here to use the pay phone, but it either isn't working or I can't make the connection for some reason. I find somebody's wallet; I ask somebody about it who's nearby (salesman? don't know), and he says Michael Dukakis was just here, with some other guys (attendants), it's probably his, maybe you can catch him. (Actually I don't go after him, but) he and his entourage come back through the inside door - it's like an opening to another store or restaurant or building, etc. I tell him about the wallet, and he says it isn't his. I'm puzzled now."
"236"	"(10/21/88)"	"I've got to go somewhere, and I'm undecided whether to go on the bus or not. I drive my car for a while, then decide it would be better to go on the bus. I stop - this is an urban area, but not downtown - and think I'll pick up the bus here. But then I realize this isn't a good place to leave my car that long, they'll tow it away. So I go back to where I started from, where I know I can leave the car, but now I realize I'll be in trouble getting back to it. The bus goes to the garage on the return journey, and it's halfway across downtown from here (which is, like, the edge of downtown, the outskirts - I guess I work around here). I'd have to walk a pretty fair distance, and it'll be late. Yuck. Now I'm thinking maybe it would be better if I go back where I stopped before. But the bus will be here soon. Can I make it there before the bus does? I have serious doubts. I mean, what if I get held up? I'd miss it altogether, and if I stay here I know I'll get it."
"237"	"(11/19/88)"	"I've just come through a house [I've forgotten whose - a man, someone we know well and work closely with, we're close to him, a relative?] and come to the bathroom, a tiny one with a shower stall. In it is a friend of mine, who I call by name [Greyraven? Bill W? Somebody on the slender, and I think shortish, side - I'd previously been dreaming of Harry Anderson, may be a variation on him, but he's taller] and I announce with glee, ""Guess what? I've finally used up all the water in the shower - that is, I've run all the water through that shower head, and now we can get a new one!"" Hooray. This is neat, you know? You see, the old shower head is somehow unsatisfactory, it's old and worn, won't put out a steady stream of water or something, and we've been wanting to improve on it. So now we can get a nicer one, brand new, that'll work better. And (the guy I'm talking to) he says, you know what else? We could actually extend this bathroom, just by moving the wall out - we could double its size. So we go look out the window in the shower stall [by the way, he was just in there shaving at the sink or something] - outside there's a pretty big parking lot, with the sort of carports you see at old restaurants and other places, corrugated roofs held up by steel posts, for 2 cars to park nose-to-nose. It extends from this 1st row just across from the window to the front of the building, with lots of space between. This is a part of town where you might find such things, reminds me of down Lamar where Automotive used to be. The house is old, and while it's not ramshackle, is no showpiece either. Comfortable, though, and a lot of people come here. Actually I think a goodly number live here. I'm concerned for a minute about this extending the bathroom out into the parking lot, it would come almost if not all the way to the 1st parking slot there, then how would people walk by to the front? [The building makes a bit of an ""L"" beyond us to the left, the back of the building, and the back door's used all the time. By the way, beyond the carport - it's maybe eight cars deep - there are trees, maybe there's a creek down there. Forward, to our right, you see the other couple carports, then a bit of sidewalk and street - probably dead-ends; there's a car-parts-looking place across the street.] But then I think, no, really, it wouldn't be any big deal to give up one parking space on the end [2, actually] , since the whole lot is seldom filled up anyway. This 1st strip usually is, though. Like I said, there are always a lot of people in and out of here. Anyhow, we see how it would be a very workable thing to extend the bathroom, very nice, we'd like it a lot."
"238"	"(11/19/88)"	"This place is very mixed up between work and home. Pat is here, there are people here that I work with, but also I have a little apartment here with 2 other girls, one of whom [I think] is Trisha. I've just come back to this apartment, it's very small, and Pat is with me, and I see that Trisha has just furnished the place suddenly. This is great, I don't know how she did it, but we certainly needed the stuff, and she's even got a Christmas tree! A small one, already decorated, it's by the big front window. I'm very pleased and excited, and I'm saying, now what can we do to add something to this [by the way, I'm also very grateful to Trisha] , and I suddenly think, Oh boy! Yeah! Sure, neon! We'll put (blue) neon lights in the window! (I'm thinking of sort of a frame, it'll make the tree real noticeable. Pat is also pleased with all of this, well, you girls are sure getting along well, glad to see you so enthusiastic, really getting into it. [Whatever ""it"" is.] [Actually the place is seeming like a dorm now.] (Another scene:) I'm looking at a piece of paper that I've found on the ground - it's a receipt, or something related to something I've been doing, outdoors here, it's something like a fair, and this has to do with jewellery. Perhaps it's a pickup slip or something, and the girl who lost it will need it to get her thing, whatever she bought. (I think she's black.) I know it relates to some things on this bulletin board, here at this booth I'm standing next to. It's one of a row of booths, all facing a sort of grassy mound and an open space, on the other side of which is something else, perhaps the stage in the 1st dream. I take down this bulletin board from the counter and look for the list (of purchasers?). Meanwhile, there's an announcement about something from across the field. I'm not finding what I'm looking for, and getting distracted by the noise. There are a couple of paper pockets with a lot of slips of paper in them, in the middle of the board slightly right of center. It should be in here if it's not tacked up by itself, and I don't see it. I'm getting a little frustrated now. I've leafed through them several times. Finally I take out the whole batch of the ones on the right and see that some have been crumpled down in back, and the one I want is there. There's been some kind of crime, theft probably. I'm not on (the grounds?) and there are a lot of people about, when this announcement is being made about it. The fact that I'm the inventory clerk is of interest here - I'm explaining to a girl standing nearby (she's got long dark straight hair, I don't know her) that I deal with the furniture and equipment. I'm with Lori, we've been doing something (working) together in this building that's a cross between work and home, and she's about to leave (for the day, I think). She says Renee wants to talk to me, she'll be along shortly, and I say ok, but I've got to do something first. I go down this open passageway to a sort of office. When I get down to the end of the passageway, I see Lori and Renee through the window - or opening, it's not a window with a frame and glass - and they're going away, I guess Lori's going home and Renee will be back. In the office I talk to this woman, she's got short curly blonde hair and is a sort of police officer. She asks me some questions and my answers confuse her. I was asked to come here and was a little apprehensive about it, but I see there's nothing much I can do to help. [This situation blends into the next one, I think - the policewoman may even be the shop owner or manager.] While I'm talking to the blonde woman, Renee comes up, waiting, and I tell her I'll be here for a bit and come along shortly, why doesn't she wait in my room? I notice her hair is rounder and fluffier than usual - still short, but a sort of bubble-do, she looks ""cute"" and girlie-er. I see that where we are there are toys, novelties, cute little things (this seems to be taking place in a little bitty gift shop) - I'm finished with the blonde woman and I start to look at these things. I'm having a good time looking at these toys, one of them is something I already have, too. After a while it occurs to me that Renee is still waiting on me, I'd better get back."
"239"	"(11/20/88)"	"In a big building - church, library? - with a lot of people dressed up - church, I think. Right now I'm walking with some people - couple of friends, maybe - and I've got on a red outfit that I just borrowed from somebody. Someone notices up near the ceiling a bird - real high ceiling, the place is stone or whatever, not wood - we look up and it's a cardinal. Well, it doesn't need to be in here, for sure - I decide to take it outside, I climb up on something and hold out my hand. It comes down to perch on my hand and I very carefully take it down and walk out with it, my friends coming along. We come to a more open space with more people, it's the church proper and just before or just after service. Once or twice the cardinal flies off my hand and I hold it steady and it comes back. I'm talking gently to it. I see my grandfather and some other people I know, we stop to let them look at the bird briefly. Then we carry on as the building widens out and opens up, then there's no more walls, then no roof and we're almost, then all the way outside, and the bird sees it and flies away. It's all green trees and lawn here, pretty. All very Sunday morning, even Easter-y. Anita lives out in the country somewhat - has she retired, or is she commuting? She has a metal box, jewellery or notepaper, and it's maybe aluminum, like those ice buckets and tumblers from the 40's and 50's, all ornate, flowery things on top like a candy box. There's some driving involved, from this little house way out here down the road a piece to somewhere else - I'm wondering if I'd like to live out here and drive to work this way - could I make a living out here?"
"240"	"(12/14/88)"	"I come into a small room (small for this purpose, anyway) to a board meeting. The board table is at the far end, raised a bit, I guess it's on a stage or riser, and takes up almost all of that space. The rest of the room has folding chairs in it and they seem to be all filled. This room is pretty crude, as though it's in one of those temporary buildings you see at churches and schools. Flimsy siding and panelling, cheap doors, etc. I'm supposed to be at the table though I'm not at all comfortable about it - perhaps I'm a sub for somebody else. I make my way up to the table - it's rectangular and set shortwise on the stage."
"241"	"(12/18/88)"	"I've just arrived at schoold-typical-looking schoold, could have been elementary, junior high, or high school, old building, large schoolyard, chain-link fence, trees. It's morning, daylight, I've just gotten out of a vehicle and stepped onto the sidewalk, ready to walk across the grounds to class. Someone has just started off before me and I see he's veering right a bit, and as I start to take a step I suddenly realize the yard is all mud. It apparently rained last night, and everywhere I see is all smooth mud. I look for the best path and notice that the footprints are all pretty shallow, so it seems it must have dried up rather a lot. Well, okay, I'll go on across. I'm very much concerned about my clothes, though - I'm wearing white running shoes, and I realize they can be wiped off. But I also think I'm wearing white pants, and all my clothes are neat and clean, and I'm quite anxious not to get spots on them. As I walk across, carefully, I think about those little spatters you get from the tips of your toes, so I try to turn my toes out a bit. And now I've made it across. By the way, I'm not actually a student here. I'm undercover, pretending to be a student to investigate something (I don't know what). I have a partner - I'll be getting in touch with her later on. Now that I'm across, I realize I'm late. A number of us are, and there are two kids at a casement window on the 2nd floor hauling kids up through it so they won't have to go in the door and run into the principal or other teachers, going through the halls. I'm not sure I can do this. You have to go head-first through a fairly small space, and I was never much for climbing. But the girl in front of me did it okay, very fast, so I figure if she can do it, I can. It's not all that high up, actually [it couldn't actually be a 2nd floor, but that's what the dream says it was) - I just clamber up on the stones of the wall and they grab me by the arms and I slide on through into the hallway. [The guy, on my right, reminds me of Brooks - roundish, medium-light brown hair, nice guy, fun-loving. The girl, on my left, is black, I think.] I'm right in front of my class now, and I can just slip in the back when the teacher's back is turned (it's a large room, with a lot of kids, and 2 doors, both of which are open), but I need to go to the bathroom first. This room is at the end of the hall, and the bathroom is just a few steps to the right, on the near side of the hall. I go on in. It's a large, open place, with stalls that just have partitions, not high walls. They're also not set in the usual straight rows; some face one way, some are perpendicular to that, and I go looking for the ""right"" stall. It seems I'm concerned about being seen, and I'm actually waiting for some other girls to leave. First, though, I'm looking in a mirror at my hair. There's a black girl in front of me and I'm sort of leaning around her. My hair is black, or very dark brown, and curly, very much like black women do their hair when they get it straightened and then ""done"" - that quality of stiffness in the curl, not bouncy and springy. It's a bit messed up from being outside - I fluff the top a bit and look at the back. The back is separating - there's a stray curl sort of stuck in limbo while some of the rest has gone straight. I don't have time to do much for it now. Also, I look down at my feet and legs - I'm not wearing white pants after all, they're black! Wonderful! My shoes are not too messy and there's only a few spots on my pants. I'm glad. Now, looking around for a stall, I wander to the right a bit and gradually realize I'm looking at the boys' section. This is a big bathroom, and the right half is the boys'. That's why it looks a bit different. I turn around; a couple of other girls leave (blondes, by the way), and I pick a stall. I'm at a sink first, though, and I'm interested in this little sponge dispenser on the right-hand side. It's a coin-op thing, I guess, though I don't see how much it is. But it seems to be saying you get 6. I don't know why you'd want 6 sponges at the same time - I also wonder if they come out dry and squashed like the French ones and then expand when they get wet. That would make them pretty portable, after all."
"242"	"(12/25/88)"	"I'm in a sort of hotel, in a room with My ex. We may actually live here, this is a bedroom, rather close, I'm not sure if there are any windows, but there are 2 beds (or one big one) and a low table with a lamp on it, it's lit and the rest of the room is in shadow - it's quite late at night and I've either already been asleep or I'm trying to get to sleep, and My ex is mad at me. He's really quite mad, and this is not unusual for him, but frankly I've had about enough of it. I get up and go out, taking my blanket with me - I'm gonna find someplace else to sleep. I go down through the hotel - the place is quite open, the room wasn't on an enclosed hallway, and there's like a gallery around a staircase, some lounge areas, an opening into maybe a restaurant or ballroom over there. I look into this side area that's got banquettes around part of it, I'm thinking I could curl up there and sleep, but everywhere seems to be occupied. This is a nice place, maybe not the very finest hotel, but pretty plush, and has flowered carpet everywhere and rose wallpaper. Looks a little Edwardian - dark wood railings and little round tables, Queen Anne chairs. Not overdone or overstuffed though. However, the place is quite busy tonight. Not crowded, but enough people about that I can't find anyplace to sleep. [Note that I consider it perfectly ok to be walking around dressed for bed, with a blanket bundled up in my arms, prepared to curl up in a chair for the night with hotel guests around.] Well, poop. I go on down to see Loretta. She's in a room/suite/apartment in another part of the hotel, a lower floor, maybe, or at least down a level. She's about to move out of this place, but I'm not sure if she's leaving the hotel or just going to a different part of it. She's happy to see me - as always. Loretta's one of my best friends, I can always count on her."
"243"	"(1/9/89)"	"I'm visiting a house somewhere, that belongs to a man, and there's some other people visiting him; it's a really nice visit. He lives by some water; a lake - I don't think it's the ocean, but it might be - in a sort of a lake-house, very large and comfortable - the sort of place that has a big window that looks out over the water, and I think he's just a friend - he's a middle-aged man, kind of a friend of the family, not a real close personal friend of mine, but he's somebody that we all like. We've gone to visit him and it's daylight - nice day - and we go outside, for a bit of a walk, to look around. Where he lives is nearby to some other houses, buildings, various kinds, a proper little wharf, even - and next door is this neat little house that is almost all glass, all the way around - it's got windows on all four sides, and you can see in, and there's furniture, and I know that somebody lives there, a man lives there - I'm looking at it, thinking how cute it is, even though I assume some awkwardness from living in such a place, where people can see inside all the time. It crosses my mind that people might break in, they can see what you've got and it's hard to do certain personal things, with people being able to see in the windows - but it sort of reminds me, in a remote way, of that dream Lori had with the glass room, and also reminds me a little of that sunken conversation pit at the apartment party room at Lynn and Dan's, that we had our party in, it was really a very comfortable, nice [area?] and this place has couches, lounge-y places in it. There is something in the middle of it - it's not just one open room - there's something in the way of wherever you are and the place you can see out, it's really nice. And while we're looking that direction, I see this man come walking up, into the room, from underneath it, somewhere. I had not realized that there was an underground to this house - and that is obviously where he does his private, personal stuff; I'm presuming the bathroom and the bedroom are down there, and there's a small staircase that leads up into this room, of course - and that's even cuter. The man comes up and into the room (I don't know precisely what happens next, what we do, but we do talk to this guy - I don't believe we go into this house - he must come outside and it's him as the image that I remember precisely about the dream. He's large, he's a burly, big man - you might think he was a logger, or a woodsman or something - he has very dark hair, a - not a big beard, but a very black, heavy beard, and mustache, and dark, bushy eyebrows - you know, that kind of person - he even has on your basic sort of woodsman outfit - flannel plaid shirt and all that - but he is not a rough man at all - he's very nice, but kind of - well, almost gruff, in manner, and he sort of glowers around - he's not actually angry at anything, it's just his manner.) And it does strike me that there is something about me or about us he disapproves of. I think it's mostly us. And the fact is that he is part of a group of people who live in this area - his house is next to some other houses that belong to these people - and they're kind of like Amish, only different - [I didn't give a name to them in the dream, they are not specifically Amish people, but they're a little like that] and there is at least one other person from this group visible in this scene. I don't think of her actually doing anything, but she's a lady, and is wearing your basic image of Amish or Mennonite lady's country-type clothes, and a cap - the kind of cap that's fitted at the back and has straps, and what's funny about that is that as soon as I notice her cap I realize he's got one on too, and I find that a little strange, but I realize that it must just be one of the things that they do, this group of people."
"244"	"(3/3/89)"	"At a movie with Chris - indoor theater, lot of kids around - there's the arcade-sort-of-things out in the lobby area (to the left of the theater proper, though, not before it, the way a theater usually is - this arrangement has been in another dream). It's a horror movie, but frankly it's pretty poor, and I am just not interested, and I leave. Somehow I get hooked up with a group of old folks on a tour bus - I think Chris and I were on this tour, but I'm not at all sure what the sequence of events is here - and all I know is the movement from the theater to a kind of roadhouse. There's a place where the bus stops, anyway, and we get off the bus and something happens. The bus leaves without me, if memory serves (I'm not sure that's right), but I don't mind - I don't mind any of this, as a matter of fact - I'm a little bit concerned because I haven't gotten in touch with Chris and here I am far away, and I don't quite know where I'm going, but I'm not worried about it. Next, I've come to a large house of a fairly large, wealthy family [I don't know how I got here, that is, consciously - in the dream it was part of the sequence of events; either I got there on the tour bus or some bus, or I got there naturally, another way] - several brothers and sisters, very nice people, and somehow I get to be acquainted with them. This is sort of out of the ordinary, but I do - there's a younger daughter who's real nice, and we get along very well - she shows me the house - particularly I've noticed a kind of sitting room/family room, with windows on the street, and there's games and things around, craft projects and things, this is where they spend a lot of their time, just in recreation, and it's not like a room with a lot of equipment in it for recreation - this is where they come to be together and just - you know, play. And there's, like jigsaw puzzles, I think - games that you put on a table. Maybe somebody's working with clay, I don't know. But it's a really very close, comfortable, friendly atmosphere, and I get to know one of the younger sons - I don't know how much younger he is and I don't think of him as a boy and me as older than him, so either I am his age (or younger) or he is my age - just the same, he's a nice, unmarried, younger son, and he falls in love with me, and buys me a Corvette. The whole production is rather neat, he has his assistant, or footman, or somebody - servant - butler - along with him, and he makes this announcement that I should come and see something, he has something for me, I think, is how he puts it, and I'm very apprehensive about this, I don't want him to have bought me something extravagant, by any means, and he drops these hints and says it's outside, and I'm suddenly figuring it's a car. ""Uh-oh, what has he done?"" And he even drops these hints about the color, and I'm saying, ""As long as it's not [I think I may have said] orange"", and it turns out that the thing is in fact half orange, it's red and orange, painted all these very fast colors, you know, with very shiny chrome, but the front part is red and the back part is orange, or the underneath part is orange and the top is red, something like that. And it is a hot car, any way you look at it, and it's in a crate - a funny kind of a crate, it doesn't exactly cover the whole car, it's kind of like you packed a car in molded plastic, and partly crated some of it, it's funny. Anyway, he shows this to me, and I'm very excited, and very pleased. Actually, I'm quite willing to have it. Part of me thinks that I ought to turn it down, and some of me also thinks that I ought to not keep it, I ought to sell it and take the cash, because that is what I normally say that I want to do with such things - I always say that ""if I ever won a contest or something..."" But this is a gift from him, for one thing, and it is really a neat car, too! A Corvette! for me! And of course I'm very surprised that he wants to do this, and I tell myself, ""Well yes, he can, so why not?"" and I'm very grateful to him. He is a very nice guy, and I think I may very well marry him, I don't know."
"245"	"(3/3/89)"	"I'm at the Center, and at the office at the same time, it seems. Bonnie is here, she's kind of in charge; there was a time when she got mixed up with Sue, but I'm not sure at all where Sue is. The office is a lot like our own, and - at least Bonnie's desk looks a lot like hers, in an alcove, and there are some desks down the middle, kinda like we have 'em now, and there are a few people there doing some phoning or something. Bonnie is doing something with some money, and there's something about Lori in this. Maybe somebody's trying to get in touch with her, I don't know - that's not at all clear, but I'm looking through some pictures in an album, and I was wanting to describe Lori to somebody, and in the pictures of her in this album that I find, her hair is two radically different ways, and both of them are different from the way she normally wears it, which I think is startling - one of them is particularly unattractive, with heavy bangs and kind of longish in the back to a flip, as it were - it really does not look good on her at all. At some point Bonnie goes somewhere and I've got to leave some money on the desk, and I didn't want to just set it in the middle - I looked around for the safest place to put it. I ended up just sort of putting it up towards the wall and putting something over it. Then the office sort of transforms into the library proper - I don't think there was an actual [dream] change. It might have been that way all along, but the fact is that they're wanting to change the furniture in our office and we need to get up and let the people who are moving the furniture around do this. There are a lot of people about - it's a busy sort of day, but it's not a normal day - maybe we're closed to the public or something, I'm not sure - but there is something about us not being dressed up for a normal workday, or prepared to do our normal work. There's somebody I'm looking for. Millie's here, I'm pretty sure; I'm not identifying anyone else except Bonnie, she's around somewhere, and Ted; and we go out of the office for a while. I'm not conscious of what we do, out, but when we come back, not only have they taken all of our office landscaping out, for the moment, but they've brought in all these fancy, shiny, well-taken-care-of antiques - they're really gorgeous pieces of furniture. A lot of them not office furniture by any means - like a dining table and chairs, there's a credenza, a drawer-thing (I'm thinking there are dressers) - they're walnut, maybe, or mahogany - dark, anyhow. They have been somewhere else, maybe in storage or some such place. I think it's in a place where they had been in use, but they needed to be moved out of there, and the only place to put them is in our office (or at least the only place where someone decided to put them was in our office). We don't need the things, and they are radically changing the look of the office, and I don't know how they're gonna get our desks and things back in there, but what they're doing is setting these things up in a sort of a room-arrangement, and their plan is to put our office landscaping back in with 'em. This is gonna be kind of fun for us, because it'll make things a lot more attractive and niced-up, and I can see where with this dining table and chairs, we can actually sit down and have meals, which is a very strange concept, but, well, it is for the moment kind of a nuisance, especially disrupting the work for a whole day by taking up all the time moving furniture. The next room (I'm not sure if that's part of our office or not) is also being temporarily occupied - by the Library Bookstore, apparently - and they have shoved all these shelves in there, and all these volunteers (you know, the stranger types?) wearing the aprons, who think that they know everything that's going on, and they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing - but what they don't know is, the people who occupy the room don't know what they're doing there and there's a conflict of interest going on. Just the same, there's nothing better to do than wander around and look at the books. And a lot of the other staff, from other places, are doing that, we're pretty much together. I don't know why we're being allowed to browse around and look at these books - I guess that they're going to actually be selling from this point (although it doesn't seem like a place to do that) and they've allowed the staff to come in and have a look even as these volunteers are filling up the bookshelves. The light in this room is yellow, rather on the dim side; the office light is very shaded - there's no direct sources of light on. Matter of fact, it's dim enough I should think they would have wanted to turn a light on to work in, by this time. But there's not just a door-size opening, it's at least a double-door-size opening that leads into the book area, that you can see this yellow light through. A lot of people are milling about and they're about to get finished setting up the antique furniture - all these wonderful Queen Anne legs, fancy drawer pulls, neat stuff, it really is. I don't know where it came from - we certainly have nothing like that in the ""real"" world."
"246"	"(3/18/89)"	"I'm with a nice young man that I've just met, and he's walking me back to school/the library/home? (I work there, and the rest of the people there are familiar library people, but it looks like an old school, very well-used, with glass windows in the doors, long tiled hallways, lockers and that.) He's being very nice to me and we've been having a nice time. He's tallish and blonde, with shortish, trim hair - I think he's wearing a suit, too. [I forget where we've been, but] he's being very nice to walk me back here - we're going through a nice old neighborhood, with cute little houses and lawns, quiet, nice little families live here. Now that we're about to part company, he's asking if he can see me again, and I'm a little shy, but I say yes. Golly, he's actually asked me for a date! I have a date with this guy! I'm befuddled and elated at the same time. Ooh. So, I go on in the building, and I'm in the hallway where we have our lockers, and I'm supposed to be putting something away for a group of us (teachers? library staff?) - some money or something, we always keep it in locker #5. The lockers are small ones, set in an alcove of sorts in the middle of the hall, rather like post office boxes, only larger, and they can be moved. And it seems that locker #5 has indeed been moved; there's some boys who were supposed to be moving some lockers, but I didn't think they meant to move this one, and they must have been early anyway. Wayne is here, he's quite anxious that these things should be put away, and I'm saying, ""But I don't see #5 - where is locker #5? did they move it? why would it be moved?"""
"247"	"(3/25/89)"	"I'm in London, out looking for the place where a friend lives - I've been staying with another friend and she's gotten a map for me over the telephone. I've come most of the way, but now I'm not sure where the turn-off is. I'm on a small, slow motorbike or Moped and it's really pretty tedious, but at least it's better than walking. But I feel kind of silly, perched up here. This street is quite long and straight, out in the suburbs, and the one I want to turn on is at right angles to it - it's quite open here, slightly rolling land, small houses and some open space between streets and the streets are wide. I make the turn but I'm not utterly positive it's the right one, and go some ways down. I get some way and decide this must not be the right street - so I turn around and go back up - it is uphill, and it takes a while. Part way back, something occurs to me, that maybe this is the right street after all, so I'll go back. But rather than turning around again (which is rather troublesome - this thing doesn't steer well), I decide to coast backwards downhill. In the rearview mirror, I see a truck coming across a vacant lot at right-angles to the street, and the lot is full of high grass and the ground is certainly not even. It's coming at a pretty fair clip and dives over a deep drop-off, sending it nose-first into the ground, and it flips over, curling up just like a truck wouldn't and back out again as it hit the ground on its back. I'm going down past it and wonder if I should go to help, but I figure people will be coming out soon anyway. As I coast down, a boy on a (bike? skateboard? something else?) is coming up the street, towards the left side, and I'm more or less on the right, but I'm finding it hard to steer and I keep veering left. As it is, I'm thinking that I'm correcting for it and I'm still veering, and he's moving left to get out of my way, and thinking surely I'll be steering to miss him, and we almost crash. I'm quite relieved that we don't, and stop a bit further down. All this has rather been enough for me, and I'm going to give the whole thing up and go home. So I ride back up the street to the one I turned off of, and look around for a telephone, thinking I'll let people know what I'm doing. [I'm not clear on whether I meant to call the person I was staying with or the person I was going to visit.] I'm no longer outdoors, now, this is a large apartment building and there's a door ajar right across from me, so I look inside. It's a sort of storeroom, no telephone, but there's another door on the left wall and a voice calls out ""What do you want?"" in a gruff English accent. I say I'm looking for a phone, do you know of one in this building, and realize from the sound that he's on the toilet. No wonder he's annoyed. He comes out quickly, fastening his trousers - looks like your olde-English gardener or villager, white hair and beard, hat, scarf, boots. Says there's not a public phone, I'll have to go outside."
"248"	"(4/11/89)"	"With a group, friends, on motorcycles - in a neighborhood, we've stopped. Getting ready to leave again, I'm going to ride the motorcycle myself (I haven't before) - it's one of those strange ones with a long front, I'm not sure I can handle it but I think so. We're like in somebody's back yard, it's got muddy patches and a few trees (rather scruffy place) - I get it stuck in the mud - first the front end, and I get it out, then the whole back end. It's very easy to pull out, as if it doesn't weigh anything, but I feel stupid and clumsy. I try to pretend it's ok. There's a place where we go into a small office building and get into an elevator that takes us up to another outside - when you get out, it's like a parking lot next to a marina (on the small side - basically I just see a red and white striped canopy, cars, some fences, the ground isn't level, it goes downhill like it does at a marina - I don't actually see any water). I'm at this place more than once. Last time, I'm with a little old woman - maybe she's even in a wheelchair - she's grumpy and crabs a lot, and when we get on the elevator I keep saying, ""Do you want me to push Express?"" but she won't listen. I guess that means the elevator has an Express function that lets you go from bottom to top without stopping - but since we do that anyway before she ever pays attention and answers me, it's ok anyhow. So remarks a man who's on the elevator with us. There are quite a few people here. I didn't want her to be making a scene, but nobody seems to mind. Michael J. Fox is my boyfriend and there's a scene somewhere, where we're french-kissing - I'm really sucking on his tongue and one of us is suggesting something, but I don't remember who or what. Blonde teenage girl - just met - went somewhere with - she's got to go - home, maybe - green grassy hill, near water I think, lots of trees - man (David Ogden Stiers?) with hatchet, I'm very nervous, want him to put it down but he wants to show me something, all very innocent but I don't trust him - I'm in car, he's outside - I try to get hold of the hatchet."
"249"	"(4/14/89)"	"I'm in a big building, a school, library, or something else, don't know - maybe mixed up with a resort? There's a group of us girls, we've been doing something; whether it was work or not, we're having fun, and we're on a rest break, heading for the bathrooms. There are guys around, too, and their bathroom is next to ours, I can see the door at a right angle to the women's. Where we are, on our way there, is away from the main area, where we'd been doing whatever it was - it's inside but very large and open, high ceiling, maybe like a convention hall. The color is all, maybe, peach? Goldish? Sand-y? There's no furniture or anything but panels, or something in high stacks at least, that make it necessary to go through from where we came here, to the bathrooms. Now, I don't know why, but I've stopped to use some mouthwash. I have my mouth all full of it when I see that there's a boy here, with a companion - girlfriend? aunt? - and he looks familiar. I think of Billy , and there's that sudden flash of silly thoughts - ""How could it be Billy? He's dead!"" - ""How can he look so much like Billy? But he's too young"" - ""Something's wrong, he doesn't look quite like Billy"" - et cetera. But I hear some other girls talking to him and understand what's going on - this is actually Billy's son, and he's come to collect some things of his father's. We didn't exactly realize that he had a son, one of those peripheral things you don't really grasp about people. The other girls are talking to him, saying sympathetic things, and I want to but my mouth is full of mouthwash. I make a gesture or two and point to my mouth, take his hand (or something in the way of touch), and smile at him. He's just finished up anyway and he's leaving. I feel a little stupid, but there's nowhere here I can spit the stuff out. Now I'm gonna go on into the bathroom and find a sink. I go through the door, it's in a dark sort of alcove, and on the other side is a surprise. For one thing, the lights aren't on, there's dim daylight coming through the windows - either frosted glass or they have curtains on. But it's not just a bathroom, it's a lounge, and it has showers (all the fixtures and decor harks back to maybe the Forties, at least the Fifties, maybe earlier, hard to say - but everything's in pristine condition) and chairs and now I'm turning a corner and here's a bed - with someone sleeping in it. Everything looks very comfortable, peaceful, quiet - I realize they've really set this place up for us to relax in. I keep going and find another bedroom, differently decorated, rather flouncy and fluffy - someone's in this bed, too. I wonder how far this goes - maybe I'll find an empty bed and go to sleep myself."
"250"	"(4/21/89)"	"I'm part of a space mission - we're military, I guess, because we have a captain and officers and uniforms - and we're on some planet in a hostile situation. There's this group of people in charge, they're like a religious sect. A group of them wear priests' robes rather like Tibetan monks and they're sort of ""enforcers"". There's also a high-priestess-type, young and beautiful, dark blonde, wears a sarong, maybe there's a high priest, too - there's a pretty fair number of 'em and they keep the people under their thumbs. They have a crystal that gives them power - you hold it up opposite something and it generates this powerful beam that does something, I'm not sure what - maybe it can blow things up. Anyhow, they sure don't like us and we're trying to get away from them and keep from getting killed - also in the meantime to help the people they're oppressing. Right now we've escaped their clutches and we're running through this place that may be underground or in an enclosed city - it's dark (rather like a warehouse, dim lights) except for where there are rooms with people in them. I'm about to get separated from my group and have to get in somewhere - I dash in a door and down some narrow spiral steps. There's a young boy here, maybe 13 - I grab him by the collar (perhaps metaphorically?) and tell him they're coming, he has to help me - he shows me another way out. We all meet up again shortly and head for the outside. There's a big chase across some open terrain; we're firing at each other and ducking and going around things (very typical movie SF stuff), but then suddenly we get caught. We sort of run smack into some more of them and we're stopped in our tracks. We know when we're beaten - there's no way we can fight this many if 'em - there's only about 6 or 8 of us. They take us the short distance to where they're all gathered and they're all turned to look at us - there are various ranks of them; the ""priests"" are sitting back-to-back along a stone or concrete block - others are arranged in some rows, rather like an audience facing away from us, toward a sort of altar - really just an arrangement of stones, and the crystal is up there somewhere. (I can't say if it's just on one of the stones, or being held by someone.) I can see it. The high priestess, turned toward us in the front row of this ""audience"", is making dire pronouncements about what's going to happen to us. Suddenly, the priests and some others start coughing and choking and holding their throats, eyes rolling up (your typical reaction to poison in the movies) and then keeling over. All the others look amazed and/or horrified, and we seize the moment. (Actually this is the result of something we tried earlier, not precisely poison but something to thwart the priests, to interfere with their systems - we put in the water, maybe, I don't remember - and we were disappointed that it hadn't worked. That was one of the reasons we had to escape. Apparently it just had a delayed reaction, and now it's killing them off, at this wonderfully dramatic moment.) We leap into action, while they're all goggling at the priests - the others don't have weapons, or any other power to stop us, except with the crystal. The captain and the other guys go for the guns they took from us; I make a dive for the crystal. This upsets the high priestess, but I stand on the stone and hold it up the way I saw her do. I have it in my right hand, trying to hold it straight up and keep my fingers off the front of it. I'm having a little trouble holding it - it's not oily but it keeps slipping down. I'm really terrified of dropping it. It appears they can't get it away from me while I hold it like this, but if I drop it they'll get it - and I certainly don't want it to be damaged. Finally I get a good grip on it, and focus it forward and down, aiming it at something (I don't know what it is - a sort of mirror? A round thing, maybe brass - down where the high priestess is). Something starts to happen. I can feel vibration, then energy flowing through my body up to my hand - then the crystal glows and shoots out a bright, wide beam of light down to the mirror-thing, where it makes a big bright glow. Everybody's marvelling at it - they're surprised that I can do it. The high priestess is watching carefully in case it screws up. Where the glow is, a picture starts to form, an oval shape as though it were in a frame of light. I see myself, like a film, looking at someone and listening (by the way, ""I"" am a beautiful, slim blonde with long hair) - then (my image) I react in surprise and joy, and say, ""A captain? Really I'm going to be a captain? Oh, thank you sir! Thank you!"" And I realize the crystal is showing me the future - that sometime I'm going to be promoted, and I'm thrilled. Everybody else is pleased, too, even the high priestess, who smiles at me as if I were an innocent young thing who's just learned how to do something for the first time. There are nods and smiles all around and everybody's happy. I guess we've actually liberated the captors too."
"251"	"(4/28/89)"	"I'm in a smallish, slightly crowded room - I think it's a living room, don't know whose. I'm with 2 others, an old woman and a girl younger than me. The room has lamps on, it must be night - the drapes are closed. We're engaged in some project, I can't say it's actually LT processing, but before we can get rolling, the old woman gets very deep into grief for her late husband. He was in the Navy, or went to sea for some reason, and was lost at sea. She hasn't cried about it in a long time. Actually she has trouble showing her feelings, and it's difficult for her to really let go and just cry. She reminds me of Nina from Park Forest, and also Martha, who covers everything up with a joke or a ""pleasant"" attitude - always be polite, never offend anybody, or disturb them. We're encouraging her, though this isn't what we planned to do, and of course she's letting her trained behavior override her feelings mostly - she keeps apologizing and getting out of her body. I have her bend over from the waist and I'm rubbing the small of her back to help her release. I don't feel any special warmth toward her, I just want her to get on with her work. I don't like people behaving this way."
"252"	"(4/28/89)"	"I'm in high school, first day I think, and we're getting our schedules and finding things, getting organized. I'm with a girlfriend or 2, and maybe a boy. The halls are crowded, kids moving all over the place. We find our lockers on the first floor, near the entrance. There's an open space here, it's all tiled. My locker is in a corner next to a wall, the upper one (these are half-lockers). I put something on a shelf, just one thing. I don't want to leave much in there yet because we don't have our locks. There's a group of boys, slightly tough-looking, nearby, and they're making some snide audible remarks about us (or one of us? or just me?). The boy with us says to ignore them. We consult our schedules - among other things, I'm taking algebra. The others go off ahead of me to class, and I stay behind for a minute, then follow. I go around the corner into the main front hall [arranged something like Kimball] where I can see the daylight coming through the open front door, and start for the stairs. Just then I realize (from the feel) that I'm not wearing any underpants. Oops! I dash back around to my locker (I don't remember putting them in there) and grab them, then go back, thinking I'll get an opportunity to jam them back on, on the way to class."
"253"	"(4/28/89)"	"I'm off on a weekend with some people, we've been having an event, sort of like the SCA having a tournament, lots of fun - we've had to bring a lot of things to set up (in that way it's more like LT), and this woman is driving some of us back to town in her very large car. We've been out in the country, it's beautiful, all green trees, flowers, sunshine, wonderful. We had a good time. The woman is older than we are, rather sophisticated, good-looking and well-dressed; she's new to all this and in a way, since she's older (we're still kids, really) she's - not precisely a mother-figure but maybe a sort of mentor. We like her. The others and I go through some of the stuff we've brought back so that they can take theirs when they're dropped off. I'm thinking about some peacock feathers and some blue artificial flowers that I brought - we've used these so many times now, they're getting to be a fixture - we really ought to find something else next time. Well, they get dropped off, and it's just me and the woman. For a bit I go all the way to the back of this very long car, to see what it's like to ride back there. The car now has an aisle down the center. We're coming back into town now, onto my street, which is lined with old apartment houses and occasional business buildings - lots of green trees, very Austin, comfortable neighborhood, everything all integrated. We pass by a new Supermarket I didn't know was there. Very nice, that'll be great, I've been going to the Kroger a few doors away (and only a few doors from me) and I prefer Supermarket. Both of these stores are, like I said, integrated with the neighborhood. They're almost on the street, no big parking lots, narrow side to the street, a simple neon name sign each, very unobtrusive. Anyway (I'm coming back up to the front of the car) a few doors down is my place, a nice old frame building with a side driveway (the sort with two paved strips) and a porch and there are people outside doing things, like the old guy on the porch next door. I like it here."
"254"	"(4/29/89)"	"I live in a little house on a suburban street with my family - I've got at least one brother, and Phylicia Rashad (from the Cosby Show) seems to be our mother. It's a very cold winter morning, and there's been a freeze overnight. I go outside to see how things are and I discover the driveway, which slants downward a little to the street, is frozen solid. A smooth, slick sheet of ice. I kneel down by it and give it a rap - it cracks a bit, underneath. Looking around, I can see the ice on everything - no cars are moving on our street but it's still very early. Farther, where I can see the bigger cross-streets and bits of main road, there are cars moving, and pretty normally. I go back inside and tell ""Mom"" that we can't get out of our driveway, at least I'm not going to try to drive on it. (I don't come in the front door - I go around to the back and come in through a sort of side room to the kitchen - maybe it's a laundry or storage room, there are a lot of things stacked around, probably some gardening equipment, outside things. The lights aren't on. I scrape my boots before coming into the kitchen.) I'm pretty sure ""Mom"" means to go to work anyway, that she expects us to keep on getting ready to go. [I don't know if I'm going to work or school.]"
"255"	"(4/29/89)"	"I'm in India, on an extended visit with some other people. We seem to be doing business. We have quarters and an office in a sort of self-contained bazaar or arcade, all indoors. [You could think of it as a crude Apparel Mart.] I am about to have a class in some physical discipline with a very distinguished teacher - it's not yoga or karate, but it has elements of both yoga and martial arts. I'm arriving at the ""gym"" - they wouldn't call it that, but this room is for this kind of stuff and it does have some fixtures like bars installed. I'm wearing a dress and daytime gear, and my big black wool cloak with the pointed hood with a tassel. [My real one has a round hood, no tassel.] The teacher is there wearing draped robes, he's on the small side and looks like you might picture such a person who's a master of an Oriental discipline - serene, calm, still, inscrutable, eyes that you know are watching your every move - wiry, looks slight but can move like a cat and real strong. He has a couple of guys with him, much larger - I'm thinking of them as his bodyguards, but they're probably not - just his entourage, I guess. Anyway, I bow and say hello to him and get ready to change clothes. Not wanting to waste any time, I've taken off my cloak and draped it over this structure (It's part of the ""gym"" equipment but I don't know exactly what it is), and I take off my shoes and a couple other things when I realize I'm not wearing any underpants. I'm shocked. I'll be putting on shorts and a T-shirt [the same navy and red I wore yesterday] and I can't not have underpants on. I hesitate for a minute, then say ""I'll be back in a minute"" and run out. Around a corner is our ""shop"" - Bonnie is there, sitting behind the counter/window, adding up figures, I think, and I say, ""Where's the key to the house? I need to get in, quick."" She doesn't respond. Or, rather, she says, ""Just a********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************ht add, there must be a large community of them here - they're not permanent residents, I know that, but on long visits, perhaps with businessman husbands. Most of these women look like typical suburban mall shoppers; various ages.) They're all grabbing things off long racks, holding them up and saying what-do-you-think? to their friends, then dashing off to dressing rooms. Someone even tosses something at me, saying, ""Isn't this great? It would look good on you!"" It's a sort of straight dress, white with polka-dots or a similar pattern in navy, with wide straps squared onto the top. Frankly I can't see it on me, but maybe she's right... I toss it over my shoulder and think about looking for a dressing room, poke my head into a workroom and realize it's too much of a hassle, and it's already half an hour past the time for my lesson. I toss the dress somewhere and get back to the ""gym"". [I had grabbed my cloak back and put it on when I left.] I'm standing there in my cloak, apologizing to the teacher and saying I can't do it today and I hope I can have another appointment, and am very curious to find I've got my shorts and T-shirt on now. I don't remember changing, I didn't have time. Still don't have underpants on, though. I realize this all looks very peculiar, but I just don't see how I can do this class without underpants. [I am, by the way, worried that the teacher may not let me have another class.]"
"256"	"(5/6/89)"	"I'm leaving work - going to be picked up by a boyfriend, who will go with me somewhere, where we'll be wearing VKian costumes. I've got on this rather nice outfit and I'm really looking forward to seeing him in his - he's good-looking, and I'm really fond of him. I work downtown and the office is in a building, upstairs, and I can't say it's the library, but I've just realized that I've left my keys there, and some other things as well, that I ought to have, and now I can't get back in since I've left my keys. I've gone down a side street - it would be near the library, at least, might be Field - so I turn right, I'm going there anyway and I keep looking out for this boyfriend, he should be along pretty soon. There's a truck of some kind there, maybe a large van, a bus, something like that, the kind of vehicle that you have to sort of climb up into. I'm up in there [I'm not sure why - maybe to wait] , looking at something [that's kinda like the dashboard, although I can't say that that's what it is] , and I rearrange something on it - I also am wondering if I shouldn't just go in what I've got on - somehow (this outfit) doesn't seem complete to me anymore."
"257"	"(5/6/89)"	"I'm at Warrior - it is dinnertime, and I've been staying in this other room, finishing something - we were all sitting in our chairs, and something was happening at the very end that I didn't finish. So instead of staying to finish that, I'm now coming into the room where everything is out on the tables - it's a long table with picnic-sort-of benches along it. There's a number of us (certainly not as many as there were at Warrior last year), and everyone else has been eating for a while. I'm rather concerned about getting enough to eat. I go around the table with this dish that I have [picked up or been handed, I don't know which] - everybody was taking something with them that they'd been handed by the cook or somebody. This was vegetable-puff things, or little bitty things that look ""grassy"" - definitely an attractive arrangement on the oblong dish, but it looked like sort of tufts of grass, which was not particularly appealing. I take it around the table with me, glancing at the other dishes as I go and think there's not much left, put my dish down and I'm talking to someone down at the end there - we get involved in talking about something and it's still a little while before I get to put anything on my plate. I go down to the other end of the table and pick up a dish or 2, sort of scrape what's left on it together and get some meal-for-me. Most everyone else has already left, it's just me and a few other people. Now we're going into another room, with Brad, and I am feeling very guilty, apprehensive, that Brad is going to find me out. He will know that I haven't managed my time very well and this is the result of it: I have not gotten myself fed because of my own indulgences. I'm very concerned about that. He's talking. There's a clump of us at one end of the room and it's almost as though we're lying down; not quite. Jenny's right next to me, and Brad is talking about something, and his voice fades out, a little now and then - I'm almost ready to say, ""I can't hear"", but I hesitate. Then I hear Jenny say - and not very loud or strong either - ""John, I can't hear"", and I repeat, almost with her, ""John, I can't hear you"", which, as soon as I say it I realize isn't quite the way we're ""sposed to say it"" - I should say, (firmly) ""John, I can't hear!"" and stick my hand up, very clearly. I also realize right after that it's not John, it's Brad - and we both said John. An interesting situation, I don't know quite what to make of that, but Brad doesn't say anything about it (at least not before I'm out of that scene)."
"258"	"(5/7/89)"	"I'm at Susan house - she lives in this house with her parents, and I'm with someone else, someone bigger than I am - can't say male or female, known or unknown, older or not - all I know is bigger than me. We are engaged in something that Susan knows about and is part of, but this particular exercise she isn't taking part in and is in the house asleep. So are her parents. She wouldn't mind if she knew we were out here in the middle of the night; just the same we don't want to wake her up. We're out on the lawn at the left-hand front corner of her house. There's a tree or 2 in the yard, lots of green grass, sturdy green grass. I'm wanting to turn the water on, and for some other reason I have to go inside of the house. To do this I go out and around to a side door of some sort (that part is not entirely visible). I go from the outside to the inside bathroom. I'm moving very carefully through the house - we both are, at first, but the other person goes off and does something else. I go into a bathroom to do something there. It's necessary for what's going on outside for me to be doing something in here. I get into this bathroom and I do turn a light on, not a very bright one - there's something like a clothes hamper that I have to kneel down by. I want to get something out of the door, and when I do - I'm trying to pull something out of this cabinet - I'm hearing a funny noise; kind of a growly noise, and I think I'm making this noise with whatever it is I'm doing. After it happens 2 or 3 times, I have a look in there, and discover a cat! It is the family cat, I know this cat, kind of, not real well, but still - he's curled up in there and I guess he's doing whatever cats wanta do in cabinets, and whenever I'm trying to pull on the thing he's making this kind of perfunctory growl at me. Not mad or anything, he's not going to attack, but I think that's kind of cute."
"259"	"(5/10/89)"	"I live in an apartment building - kind of one, I'm not real sure what it is - very open, has an open walkway with a railing, in front of the door that I've come in and out of. I'm not sure if I live alone or with some other people, but there's others around, they're all my age - once again I'm younger (or seem to be younger) than I am - I'm thinking of all these people in their twenties, a lot of camaraderie, lot of ""youthful"" palling-around is going on around here. I'm waiting for an old friend to come visit me - it's your typical week (or weekend) visit, and I'm getting ready for that. There has been a big mess made outside somewhere, for some reason. It involves tape - stuck to the railings of this outside bridgework, and it's the ""guys"" who have put it there - I go along and take it off, kind of when they're not looking. They were going to do it anyway, but I decided I'd just go ahead and do it. Then my friend arrives. Turns out she's a girl, and I do not know her in waking life - she's nobody in particular - and I also don't feel very close to her. Like I say, she's an old friend, I haven't seen her in a long time. This is not your warmest possible greeting. We're just curious to see how things are gonna go. I introduce her around."
"260"	"(5/14/89)"	"I'm at a LT event - probably WOW - a resort, somewhere a place out in the woods, anyway. I've been in a room with some old people and we've gone down to a room where another thing is going on (this is very disjointed). Not everybody who's attending is in this room - this is not a set part of the program, precisely; it's not like anything we normally do. There is someone leading; it's night, probably quite late, and there may be 30 or 50 people in here (I'm not sure - maybe not that many, but there's a lot). Something is finished, which is the reason that not everybody is together, and the guy who's leading decides to try something - it's a kind of meditation, we're going to lie down on these benches that are here, and do something; I did not quite get that at first and so I'm standing up, doing something, talking to somebody, for a bit while everybody else is rearranging themselves. Then when I see that they're all lying down, it turns out that there isn't room for me on any of the benches that are here. I go into another room to find something. I kinda thought there was a bench of this sort in the room I just came from. We go down there and somebody's there - it's not precisely a bedroom, but there is a bed in here, and somebody is there talking on the phone, I think - I look around, look beside the bed and the wall and don't find the bench that I thought was there - I think somebody's already thought to get it and take it down there. Come back down the hall, and I go into the room that's opposite the one where everybody else is, and poke around there. There's a number of kinds of things in here, and one of them looks as though, if you folded it right, it might be a bench that you could lie on. It's kind of like water skis or something - it's definitely sports equipment. The pieces are narrow, long, have markings on them like sports equipment does, stripes, numbers, etc. They're attached end to end and there's some hinges, like you could fold the things some way or other. I fool with it for a bit and get it to stand up, the way a bench would, and discover that the hinges are the wrong way to do this - or at least I haven't figured out how it is - so it won't stand up if you were to try to lie on it. I go back into the other room, then, to see what I can do - maybe just lie down on the floor."
"261"	"(5/14/89)"	"I'm at the library - a library, it's more like a branch library than Downtown. There's a large staff here, and the staff is a sort of a school as much as just working here. I am sort of a senior in the school; there are a number of us who have passed through what grades there are to get to - we're the top of the line, anyway, and then you become full-fledged library clerks. I think Sue S runs this school (or library, or business, or whatever it can be called). And this is the day that we ""graduate""; it really has not come upon us yet that we are actually going to stop being employed here, until now - and the fact is that people keep coming into this program - they're getting trained, and moving up the way we've done, but there's only so much room, you can't continue filling the place up with staff, so the people who finish up have to go. I am not enjoying thinking about this at all. I like it where I am and certainly don't want to go out in the cold, cruel world on a job, however well-trained I may be... As I say, this looks like a library - has a brick exterior, some trees and things, maybe more like X town than not, but it's certainly bigger than an ordinary branch, and dark inside - not all the way dark, but it's mystery-movie dim, I might say - not properly brightly lighted as it would be if this were the real world. Those of us who are ""graduating"" are talking together, wondering what we're going to do - I decide I want to get off by myself to talk to someone - it's a guy, he's tall, can't say that he's employed here, but is a regular person, mainly, comes around on a regular basis - can't name him; older than me, a middle-aged man, I'd call him blue-collar, he seems to have on a white overshirt (or light-colored anyway) and some sort of nondescript pants. I'm not crazy about him, but he's a friend and he seems to want to talk to me - he's got something to say. We're discussing my situation. [Somewhere in here, it occurs to me: ""Oh, yeah, I work in the Business Office - that's right, they probably can't let me go, because after all I am unique here. Ted needs what I do, and we've already been through some short-staff periods - he can't use these (old? other?) people, so I'll probably stay! Oh, great!] Anyway, my spirits are rather up again, and we go off - I guess you'd say down the hall, though that doesn't really compute. We go into a room that's not only unoccupied but there's nothing there; it more resembles a building than it does a room - imagine that it's isolated - call it 4 walls out in space, even an independent roof to it. We go in there [there's somebody else involved here, but I can't say that it's someone with us at the time] and start talking; he is, like, psychic, and he tells me some things that I didn't know - but while this is going (actually I have been noticing before) that I have got these tattoos all over me - rather, not tattoos, I was born this way, and while I'm in here right now I'm looking at them again. There are symbols all over my body; they're not like tattoos, properly, they're not pictures. A number of these things are words, even signatures, as though there was like a short form of some kind, and while I'm looking I've noticed for the first time in my life that these things are signed with my name in different ways (some of them - some use my name in other places than a signature but still) - in one place I have actually - it is actually my signature, ""Althea C.S. Webb"", which I was not born with, and which shocks the hell out of me to notice. I start exclaiming about this, and I explain it to him; there are also other things on my body that are not just straightforward graphic representations - a couple of them look kind of curly, as though somebody had tried something and wasn't very good at it, it's fuzzy - there's a circular form that's like that particularly, here in a couple of places - there are lines going through it, more like brush-strokes than pen-marks. I had been thinking how nice they were, that I had all this decoration and didn't even need to go out and get tattoos, and I really rather like the way it looks. And it does make me unique. But this guy is telling me some things about myself that I didn't know, and he's getting it from another source, another entity - channeling, I guess - and then when I start becoming quite concerned about this he starts talking in a different voice - and, indeed, he's now the other entity that's talking. He's beginning to even look different, I could almost see a definite change in his features come about. He starts telling me some things about myself that I rather like, they're rather encouraging. [I'm just not remembering what they are, and can't repeat them here.] The atmosphere changes - oh, my, yeah - it's as if a sort of Twilight Zone has descended upon the place, and for a minute or 2 I can see the universe, the stars, and I ask him, ""Isn't this kind of sad to be in the dark all the time?"" Not living here on earth you must be living out in the universe, is my line of thinking - where all it is, is dark and the little tiny points of light that are the stars. And he says, ""No, indeed, it's not dark at all, because the light comes from you - it's all quite bright around where you are, and there's nothing dark about it."" A bit later, sometime during this particular scene, someone has to go over to this place that I had come from before - is a house, it's all deserted, and there's something Greek about this place - it's all open, and there's a verandah or porch or something like that, with trees around it, all rural-looking. I had been there with this - I'd even call it an entity - kind of like a fairy, smallish entity and it didn't want to come along. Somebody has to go back to see how she is. Also while I'm in the room with this guy, somebody from outside tries to come in, to check to see if there was anybody in here, and our idea is to keep other people out while we're talking, but nothing comes of it."
"262"	"(5/20/89)"	"I've come into a bedroom, where there's mainly a double bed and a TV - there are windows, it's bright daylight coming through filmy curtains. There's somebody in/on the bed, I think male, young, he's just watching TV game shows. I get on the bed and join him."
"263"	"(5/21/89)"	"I'm on an almost-empty street in a small town. There are shops, etc., and street lamps. I'm walking down the street, about to turn a corner, and I'm confronted by a loud man in a raincoat - he's really mad about something but I don't know what. He just stands and yells at me, sometimes shoving with his elbow and shoulder - he's got his hands stuck in his pockets. I retreat up the street a bit - there are some people out watching. I guess they think I had something to do with this guy. He follows and keeps yelling at me - some of the time he yells around in general but it's mostly at me - I don't know him and definitely didn't do anything to start this, it seems he's just picked me because I'm handy. (""THE ANGRY, ANGRY, MAN"")"
"264"	"(5/27/89)"	"I'm still in bed, just normal, trying to sleep - I get up, I guess I'm going to the kitchen or I'm checking on the cats, did I hear a noise? I see through the bedroom door that something is very, very wrong - the left hand wall (with an incorrect door in it) is lying on the floor, part of it anyway, and there's daylight coming through. I know that Julia planned to have some work done on the place, but I certainly didn't think it meant taking the walls off. This is terrible - I wonder if the workmen have done this by mistake, or is it really necessary? I can't see any way it would be. It's awful, it's dangerous, the cats could jump out or fall out the hole - I'm quite nervous about that, and I make sure they're in the bedroom so I can shut the door, but that's not great, there's no air conditioning in there. I go toward the bathroom - I'm planning on getting dressed and going to find Julia or call her and find out what's going on here - and suddenly the bathroom wall falls out. There's a couple of guys out there that I see through the hole, I suppose they're on ladders - they're wearing khaki uniform shirts and look like nice clean guys. I'm just standing there horrified. I've got to go out and do something about this. I pull on some pants and go out the front door. There's a concrete landing and stairs outside the door (which is on the south wall) that lead forward rather than backward. They're still working away at something out here, but I don't know what."
"265"	"(5/28/89)"	"I am with a bunch of people who are friends or family, somewhere out at the edge of town or perhaps in the country. Across the road are fields - someone's working over there. Where I am is a kind of courtyard, it's largish and open - one side has an eave or awning over a walkway. There's an opening into another part of whatever this building is (up at the inside corner of the walkway-covered side). We've been doing something that was tough and hot and tiring. Earlier the people across the road had turned on a giant fan, and we had all cheered and clapped and jumped up and down. (I don't remember what we were doing at that time.) Something is happening to shrink a dog that I am with - I'm with part of these people, and one of them is James Garner (but not quite), and something dramatic is happening. I'm very worried about this dog - his body's getting smaller and smaller. (It seems to me that his head is not.) I'm asking him to jump up, and he does that, and licks on my face, and I hold on to him real tight. This is overcoming something, but I'm not sure what - I'm relieved that he can do this, or will do this, and I've gotta do something for him really quick. (The James Garner character) is encouraging me and patting me on the back and giving me support. We go through that opening, back to the outdoors, with this group of people. Suddenly we hear a noise, thundering - we look around, and from the back part of this courtyard, through another opening to an outdoors area, there comes this stampede/chase - what I think is happening is horses are being chased by some predator or other and there is a horse in the lead, big brown horse, looks lovely, and I'm saying, ""Run, fella! Run! Run!"" But what comes behind him is in fact deer, like proper forest deer. I don't see any predators like wolves or anything. They are moving at a pretty fast clip. They go around the courtyard and toward the left side, not straight across, and around the semicircle before they run off out of sight and they kick up a little dust. The people across the street turn the fans on again, and this is some cause for cheering again. (I think I've still got this dog in my hands - he seems to be sitting in a bucket - the bottom part bucket and the top part head - he is getting smaller.) Now, for some reason, I run around to the far side. There are bushes and things in the middle of this courtyard, some of which have thorns (and I don't know what it is that I'm running for), but I fall down and slide under one of the thorn-bushes. Nobody has seen me do this because they've all gone back through to the inside. When I come to rest I realize that I've got a buttful of thorns from the branches and some in my face; they're stuck there pretty good, and if I move I make it worse, which is scary and painful. I call for help - I call ""Please come help me"" - and at first no one hears me, but I try to call louder. I think somebody sees me through the opening and they're going to come, but in the meantime a car pulls up from the road, a convertible - very fast-looking Corvette type, and 2 boys get out - not real young, they may be college students or slightly older, nice young men, both very good-looking, wearing short-sleeved shirts. They see what's happened to me and come to the rescue right away. I didn't have to ask them and they didn't have to look around - nobody had to call for them. They just literally saw what was going on and came to help me. They start working with the branches, getting the thorns off me so I can move, especially getting them off my face. The worst part about my face is that if I try to turn my head the pressure gets worse and it hurts, a whole lot, and I keep my eyes squeezed real tight so I won't see anything and try to move my head. They haven't doctored it up or anything yet, but they've got me out of the brambles and so I'm just laying there flat."
"266"	"(2/2/90)"	"Driving away from somewhere, on a side street - either I just got in the car and it won't go, or I've just driven around the block and it stopped. Can't get it to go, so I get out and start to walk back for help. A few steps away, I wonder if I've set the brake. I look back, and, sure enough, it's rolling. At first I think it'll only roll a little bit, but just as I start to go on, it picks up speed. I try running after it a few steps, but I'll never catch it and if I did I couldn't stop it. So now I need help even more. I suppose it'll roll down to the end of the street and bump into something and stop. Like the curb. I hope. A little way further along the sidewalk there's a big hole - actually it goes down and then up, the sidewalk continues on the other side several feet above me. It's not natural, this hole - it's something to do with construction. The dirt is all red and sandy or clay, relatively clean, and I've got to go past it. It's lumpy, craggy, so I can step and climb up, but it's also slightly treacherous. It could break off if I grab an insecure bit. I sure don't want to fall and hurt myself, and I wish I didn't have to do this - but there's no other way if I want to get help. I can do this. I'm strong enough, and it isn't so big or hard as all that. I remember the raft trip, walking on those rocks, doing whatever I could do at the time. So up I go, stepping here and grabbing on there. There's one particular place I think might break off if I grab it, but it doesn't."
"267"	"(2/5/90)"	"I'm staying in someone else's house in another town, I'm here with a group - it's probably LT. Alleycat is with me, and I'm rather worried about him climbing on things - right now he's walking on some built-in bookshelves. There are books and knickknacks on them, and while he's being quite genteel, you know how easily these things turn to messes. If I disturb him, he might make a sudden move and knock something off. There's nobody else here at the moment, and I want to go into the bathroom just off here and take a shower, but I wonder what to do about Alleycat."
"268"	"(2/16/90)"	"My apartment is part of a complex, and it has a side door from the bedroom that opens onto a wood walkway, and there are bridge walkways to other parts of the building. (Seems to be redwood - it's quite pretty, there are green trees and flowers, nice place.) Gail Bialas is showing me something she's quite pleased about, and we talk. I go back inside. I don't have any lights on, and it's a bit gloomy. [Something] warns me that something is wrong, and I quietly go through to the living room and find that the place has been broken into. Turning toward (where the kitchen usually is), I see two girls just coming out (of what must be a bedroom - ?) with handfuls of my stuff, mostly jewellery. They don't seem to be especially big or especially tough, and while they're not particularly intimidated they do drop the stuff when I say ""Hey - that's mine - what are you doing here?"" (Or words to that effect.) They leave, but still look very self-confident and insolent. They're both blonde, by the way, pretty but a little trashy, wearing black leather jackets and jeans. (Actually they remind me of Kelly Bundy.) Outside, I can see there's more of them - at the front door, my apartment is on ground level and there's no deck - what I see are little hills, sort of dunes, hardly any grass, a bit of road - like I lived out in the boonies. Actually there's a whole gang outside - motorcycle - and they're just hanging around out there, milling around, some of them watching me. I wonder what they're planning. I'm afraid to go out there. They'd probably beat me up. I expect I should call the police."
"269"	"(2/18/90)"	"I'm living in a very interesting apartment on top of a little building in the middle of town (probably a very small town) - it's got several rooms and was quite cheap for the space. Actually I'm living with somebody else, and also the other person's younger brother. I'm not sure who's temporary here - I think he's looking for a job and just staying for a while, but it might be me. I've only recently broken up with My ex, and I'm storing some of his stuff for him. [Actually, I don't see any actual evidence of anyone else in this place - all the furniture seems to be mine.] The others are gone off this morning, and I'm poking around, wearing a pink satiny nightgown and robe set, short - I'm a normal size - and I go from the back through to the living room. Has a lot of nice antique pieces, but doesn't look ""done"". Then I go back to this middle room where there's no furniture, but some extra plants that are just stored here. One of them is a kind of tree that's been growing a lot, and needs a new pot rather badly. It's been in a small black plastic one, and as I handle it, it falls out. I fiddle with it some to see how it'll stand up and what sort of pot it might need, and I think I'll go look round the corner. There's an alcove (this place is a lot like an attic) where some odds and ends are ""stored"" (they're just sitting out) that either I don't have a place for or they're My ex's. I haven't looked over here much lately, I've come to sort of turn a blind eye, and now that I'm looking, I'm surprised. There's a few bits of furniture and some ceramic urns and figurines, and also here's a stack of glasses, tumblers, rather fancy ones with a shaped bottom and gold/red trim. Then there's some others I see nearby, just as I'm thinking, ""Gee, I could have used these at the Christmas party and wouldn't have to buy plastic ones at all"" - I'd forgotten all about them. Most of this stuff I'd gotten at garage sales. I'm looking at a tall urn, narrow, white porcelain with flowers on, that might be good for the plant. I'm wondering if it's heavy enough not to be knocked over. I reach for its top and lift, not looking directly at it, and I'm surprised it's so light until I look and see it's a small urn I've got, it was inside the bigger one. I lift the bigger one and find it's quite heavy after all - good. On my way back to the other room I find a brochure lying on a couch that's on the opposite wall - it's for this auction or estate sale of My ex's other, larger, furniture, which is elsewhere. I sit down to look at it, but it's still too dark to read, so I stand up and switch on the overhead light. Just then, I hear something at the door. Someone's coming in, probably the younger brother - he's probably forgotten something. I have that traditional reaction of not wanting to be seen, so I decide to hide. I switch off the light again, gambling that he isn't far enough into the room to see it go off, then quickly step through into my bedroom. I pause, then decide to go all the way outside on the terrace/roof. (There's some plants and furniture out there, and also gravel rooftop. You can see the town around the building, a little urban setting - looks somewhat 50's - and if people on the street are looking up, they can see you.) I hide around the edge of the door, listening. There is some movement nearby, but it turns out to be Tree - he just comes out through the door, looking very elegant. He's just been in a TV commercial, advertising some recordings, I think - I remember some blurb written about him, in the papers or TV Guide, maybe, about how he's the ""finest illustration of Bure, ('somebody', and 'somebody')"" there's ever been, this is just great. I think it's very sweet and funny. My Tree, a TV star. Great."
"270"	"(2/19/90)"	"I've gone to a party at Lorren's house. Lori and Renee are there, but for the most part I don't know anybody. There's particularly a group of nice-looking young men, who are having a pretty good time but sticking together. Little by little people are going away, and I figure they must be leaving. Eventually I have no clothes on [though I don't know why I took them off, except I know I think it's the thing to do] , and I wonder if somehow people don't want to be around me because of it. I decide I might as well leave - I know Lori and Renee are in another room watching TV, and I suppose I ought to say goodbye to somebody, so I go that way and find there's a lot more people in there than I thought. Maybe half the party's in there, just watching TV. I'm really at a loss now. I put my clothes back on and leave."
"271"	"(3/7/90)"	"I've come back into this house where someone I know lives and teaches dance [is she a personal friend? - don't know] . She's a little like Amanda, leaning toward the dotty side, older but won't act like an old woman. Her living room is smallish, a little dark with only a couple of table lamps lit (it's night-time) - flowered couch down the side, coffee table piled with books and notebooks. [Seems like this is a college town or neighborhood, and everybody is either attending or teaching or something. She's a regular fixture herself and has a kind of professor-status.] I've come in a bit late. The class she's been teaching is just leaving, they're milling a bit. The teacher's not visible, she's probably in another room. One kid (tall, reddish-blonde, swaggery) says she's through for the night, too late, or words to that effect, but I know she needs to see me (or vice versa? or mutual?), so I'm gonna stay. She'll be out. Meanwhile I pick up a book off the coffee table to look through. I thumb through it and light on a particular page. It's a kind of who's-who, and has little bios of people. This one is describing Alan Nagy and has a picture. At first I only glance over it idly, noting the expected, that he has a degree in psychology, went to such-&-such university. Then I look closer, because the picture doesn't seem to fit, and realize that he was actually only noted for psychology on the side. His main focus was art, and this picture shows a huge sculpture being lifted upright with scaffolding. It must be bronze - looks it - and the caption says it's eight feet tall. There are a couple of men in the picture. I expect one's Alan; I'd like to see it closer, I want to see what he used to look like, but I'd need a magnifying glass and more light."
"272"	"(3/16/90)"	"I'm in a sort of police station, I think - a very plain room with plain desks and chairs, gray colors - and a woman is interrogating us, or maybe only the man I'm with. I'm paired with him [for reasons unknown] and James Dennehy is paired with another woman. The man is rather short, middleaged, wearing a suit - I think the interrogation is about him, and his wife beating him or something. It's a pretty cut-and-dried business, and over soon. James and the woman leave first, then us. We don't go the same places, and on my way home I decide I should go check on him, so I go to his apartment, which faces out over the sea on a hill, with a lovely terrace down below the long row of doors. His is right above the terrace, but I'm not positive which one - they all look alike. I know exactly its angle from the terrace, though, because I've sat there. But the terrace is overgrown with some sort of vines or long stick-like plants that have grown up from below - how could this happen in only a few hours? They're about halfway up the steps and over the floor of the terrace. I start down the steps, thinking I can get by them, but then realize I can't. Hum. So I go back up and pick a likely door. It seems like a good choice, because as I stand in front of it, I see it's shorter than the other doors - I would actually have to duck to get in. Even the building is shorter than the apartment next to it. I knock on the door, and to my surprise, James answers, ""Who is it?"" He lives next door to the man, so it must be the next apartment I want. It turns out James has just now gone to bed after talking to the little man - he just left, seems to be all right. I say how sorry I am for disturbing him (he hasn't opened the door, we've been talking through it) and that he should go back to bed. I'm in a prison, visiting with another woman. We're in an open area where a couple of very wide corridors meet and a sort of terrace begins. It must be late afternoon, the light is getting dim and yellow-gray. We sit down on a couple of long park benches. (Seems like we read or study for a little while.) After a while the men (inmates) start coming, and they gather around to talk to us, and we talk to them. (We're here for some educational purpose, I'm not sure what - it's as if we're teaching them something, like sages or something.) They crowd us a bit, and a few of them hold out things they want us to take, and I'm saying, ""Guys, you know I can't take this - you know better than that!"" (Because of the rules.) Gradually they go again. I'm smoking a cigarette, and I've been flicking the ashes on the floor. I'd just done it automatically, and now I see that there are no other ashes or butts anywhere, except mine. I'm about to crush it out on the ground, but I'm feeling very self-conscious about being so messy, so unthinking. I could have found (asked for) an ashtray, after all."
"273"	"(4/15/90)"	"I'm on my way home - where I live now. I've been where I used to live, I think it's my family home and my mother or stepmother was there. I've been moved out for some while, but I'm finally moving out the last things. Right now I'm pulling a piano behind me. I don't have any other way of getting it home, so I've rigged a harness so I can pull it on its casters. It's not big, maybe it's a baby grand - black, curvy shape, definitely not an upright. Fairly easy to pull, but still quite a chore to get it all the way there. I have to pull it on the street, of course, and it's causing somewhat of a traffic problem. Especially, I have to go up some stairs, fairly steep and rather long. [Never mind that the cars couldn't go up steps - they're still there.] Part of me says I can't do this, but little by little up we go. It's hard but not as hard as I thought it would be. I'm worried about losing it altogether and it falling back, but at least there are cars behind me (I'm concerned about that - they're lining up and I'm so slow) and the one behind me would stop it. Actually, I kind of wish it would help me by pushing. But finally I get it up to the top, very slowly, very slowly, bit by bit. As it gets on level ground one wheel at a time, I'm more relieved. I pull it off to the side so the traffic can get past and rest. This isn't exactly outdoors any more, by the way, it's some sort of department store. I think about what I need to do to get it the rest of the way home."
"274"	"(4/20/90)"	"I'm in London, having been here on a vacation, and getting ready to go home. I'm travelling on an ""alternative"" airline, it's got stewardesses and a regular plane and all but it sure isn't as professional and organized as, say, Pan Am, or any other one I know for that matter. I'm with a group, like a large tour group or charter, though I haven't been with them in England, just the flight. We're just getting on the plane, bustling with luggage and all, the stewardesses are trying to get it all organized, and it's not coming together very well. They have uniforms - dresses - but they sure aren't very attractive, quite dull. And they seem not especially nice - not rude, but detached, a bit frustrated, not sharp at all. We, the passengers, are helping to get the luggage stowed, and some of us are instructed to go up to the top of the plane (outside), where we hand luggage down a ladder - well on the side. It's bright daylight, getting to the tail end of the afternoon. I'm talking to an older woman about my trip, and telling her how extraordinary it was that I had run into 3 - was it 3? - well, 2 at least - people I knew. I started to tell about one of them and then remembered Elizabeth. Oh, yes, I said, it was 3! I forgot Elizabeth Hilbish! And proceeded to describe her situation with the guy she met in Hawaii, but somehow the woman I'm talking to isn't paying attention. She keeps on misunderstanding and I keep saying, no, it was this... There are others up here, and crew on the ground doing things, and there comes a box or something being passed through that the older woman says she won't touch. She's already done that before, and it's just too heavy, and why are we having to do all this anyway? So we're just watching. Eventually, things seem to be complete and the rest of us are waiting for instructions, when there's some sensation of the plane moving, and we suddenly wonder, what if the pilot forgot to check whether we were off the roof and took off? Given the level of competence of the whole crew, it's possible. (By the way, on this roof are large round - shoulder-high - barriers around the edges, we've been leaning against them; they're soft, like hard rubber or something.) Just as we're reassuring ourselves that nothing like that can happen, it does. The plane moves a bit forward and starts to nose upward. We start screaming for help, ""No! Stop! We're still up here! You can't take off!"" et cetera, and we're joined by people on the street below, mostly kids. This plane is sitting right in the middle of a neighborhood with nice houses and lots of green trees. Somehow it doesn't need to taxi, but just goes straight up to take off, nose first, which apparently bends, because it's going up but we're not. There are all these kids shouting at its nose as though it were an animal, like a horse or cow, and they were trying to get its attention. They're trying to communicate to the pilot, there are people on the roof. It does stop, just in time, and I'm starting to fume. I swear I'll never use this airline again as long as I live. The panic was awful, I was trying to hold on to the rail and knowing there was no way I could hold on in flight - no question about it, I'd be dead. I pictured us just flying off the roof one by one, and this asshole pilot not even caring. Apparently the crew thought it was our own lookout for us to get back inside."
"275"	"(5/5/90)"	"I have these white mice, 5 or 6 at least, and I need to get them into their little separate containers. They've got these boxes, plastic I guess, that they need to be in, I guess so they can be moved somewhere. I've been trying to make them nice for the mice, and I've put some stuff in the bottom, and also a layer of white stuff that mostly looks like salad dressing, so they can have something to snack on. I get one of the mice and put it in its box, but it looks like I got too much of the salad dressing in there because it just slips and gets submerged in it. I take it out, and my word it's just all over salad dressing, how awful. I certainly didn't mean for this to happen, he must be feeling just awful being covered with salad dressing. I'll have to clean him up, but how do you clean a mouse covered in salad dressing? I'm sorry. How stupid."
"276"	"(5/10/90)"	"I'm in a bus (school-bus type) with Jimmy - he's driving - it's dark and the road is wind-y, goes by a creek, with a nice bit of green bank and trees between, lower than the road. It's been raining, and might again. We're not travelling so fast as all that, but the turns are coming faster and tighter, so Jimmy's having a time keeping up. Well, here we go anyway - off the road, there's a turn he knows he can't make, so we're off onto the grass, and he's trying to keep from running us into the creek. This bus has a lot of momentum, so we have to do quite a bit of swerving and changing to keep the sucker out of the trees and the creek and maybe come to a stop or get back on the road."
"277"	"(5/11/90)"	"I'm on a bicycle, in a hurry to get somewhere. I decide to cut through to another street by going down a side street I haven't been on before. This street - it's only a block's worth, really - is just lovely. It's got big, arching green trees with huge ivy-covered trunks, and cute little houses. Because of the trees being so big with such interwoven branches, it's rather dark, but cool, gentle, lovely. I'm really surprised, how come I don't know about this street? Does anybody? The residents probably are very careful to keep it nice. Anyway, at the end of it, it goes into a sort of park. It's connected to a school, and I can cut through the grounds this way. I weave my way on my bike through various schoolyard paraphernalia, including a football game. I get the impression the coach is not too keen on this, so I hustle and duck into a building - a gym or something - still riding - until I can make my way out the other side to the street."
"278"	"(5/15/90)"	"I'm driving in somewhat of a hurry, and stop at the light. There's a car in front of me, and it doesn't go when the light changes. I honk & yell but nothing happens, then a barrier arm comes down and blocks the road as if it were a railroad track. Now I'm really mad, and when the thing lifts and everybody else drives off, I basically just do a No process, wave my arms and yell and even get out of the car and pound on the side. Finally I get back in and drive off. It helped some. Where I go is some kind of institutional building - I have an appointment for consultation, I think with Ted Danson. He's tied up at the moment, I'm waiting. There's a flight of stairs in the center of the floor with no railing. Also a dog or cat here that I'm very glad to see, an old friend. [A nice friendly feeling is part of this - I am liked here, I feel wanted.] I'm in a room with at least one other person when a guy pops in looking for a different room, he's come to apply for a job. I can see there's something unusual about him, then realize he's handicapped. [The actual nature of the handicap isn't specified.] He's wearing a suit and he's very insecure, almost bumbling. He has a musical instrument with him, and it has various parts to it. I tell him where he needs to go, and after he leaves I see he's dropped one of these parts. I take it down to the room - it's a classroom, and the teacher is up front, he's already had the guy go into his office. I wait at the side (like we do at the Training with Trainer notes) and he nods and beckons me over. I show him the part and he says he'll take care of it. He makes a joking remark about the guy, not quite disparaging but close. He (the applicant) hasn't made a very good impression so far."
"279"	"(5/18/90)"	"I'm in an office, I think, or some place that's not a house - it gives onto the street. There's a man here attacking someone I'm with, he's trying to rob us, I think. I have a spray bottle of water (like the one I use on Rouse) and while they're grappling I spray the attacker with it. At first it's hard to hit him anywhere that counts, but then I get him right in the face and throw him off balance. I keep spraying him, and he tries to come after me, but I keep just barely out of his reach. The struggle ends up going outside into the street. (It's a business district, a sort of minor street, no traffic but there are people about, who gather and watch. Smallish brick stores and office buildings.) The man keeps making lunges, but I keep from being grabbed solid and get in another spray. At last he gets turned around just right, and we can grab him and pin his arms. All over. Now we can call the police. I'm with a number of other people outside a barnlike building on the grounds of a rather country-looking house - it's not out of town but in an old section, this is more like a tiny farm than a big back yard. Big trees, weathered wood, everything all green and overgrown. There's a sort of deck outside the barn with small tables and chairs on it. There are also wood rail fences around the property. It's not a sunny day. We're here as a sort of meeting, not formal but to discuss something, a project, it's somewhat political in nature. I'm not actually part of this group but they want me to discuss this business with them. I don't feel adequate to that, frankly, I don't know that much about it, but they seem to think it'll be worthwhile. Lori's supposed to be coming too, but she's late if she's coming at all. I'm bothered about that, impatient. There's food here, we're having sort of a picnic, and the others are going inside but I want to stay outside for a bit, sit in the air and collect myself. I've come to a place where there's a big open wood building, kind of a cross between a garage and a barn. You can park head-in on dirt right in front, and I've brought the Toyota here to pick up this white truck (small, like the Toyota). Someone was supposed to come with me but didn't. I meet somebody inside and settle things up, but now that I'm leaving I get on a bicycle and start to ride away. The road goes around a stand of trees in front, and just as I go around the curve I stop, realizing I've got to at least take the truck back. So I go back, put the bike in the truck and go. I'd rather have ridden the bike, but at least this'll be faster."
"280"	"(5/19/90)"	"I've just come home from work - I live in a house in a place a lot like where we've lived in suburbs - Tree and Alleycat live with me, but the 3rd is a fluffy white cat. When I come in I'm in very good spirits and think about getting outdoors, maybe go for a walk right away like I used to (only I never used to, but the memories are in my mind). I figure I'll at least go to the mail box, which is for some reason far away. I could have stopped by in the car but didn't think about it. So, inside this nice-looking suburban house, I've come in the back door, gone through the kitchen, and realized Alleycat is outside - has been all day, he got out and wouldn't come in. So I go to the front door through a sort of dining room or den - it doesn't actually have furniture in it, but that's its location. It has a ceiling fan, which I turn on. At the front door, the other 2 cats go out, I guess to do their business, and there's Alleycat, along with something on the ground, it seems to be a present for Alleycat. It would appear he has an admirer, and he's been getting these notes. [I'm not positive, but it may be that she took him away in the morning and brought him back just before I got home.] Anyway, it's dinnertime, and the idea is we all should come in now, please, and it takes a couple of requests. Tree comes in first, then the white cat, then Alleycat. (There's a screen door, so it's okay that the front door is standing open all this time.) I gather up Alleycat and his presents and go inside. I turn off the overhead lights - there are 4 buttons, dimmers, and I hit them wrong a couple times before I get it right. Then I'm gonna turn off the fan and forget where the switch is for a minute (it's on the opposite wall, into the kitchen). I can see out the glass back doors (sliding) the nice green hill beyond - I used to live a few streets over that way, there's a creek between, too, and I'm wondering if there's a passage over the creek without going all the way around. That's where I still get mail."
"281"	"(5/20/90)"	"I'm in a living room of sorts with 2 other people, at least one is male, and they're friends, but I can't name them. We're sitting talking. Somebody may be just moving in here, but I'm not sure it's me who lives here. Outside on the deck - very like my real one, but not obscured by the trees - is a great deal of stuff, mostly if not all electronics, stereo equipment, some quite large. It's not night, but it's either overcast or twilight, rather dim outside, and inside we don't have any lights on so it's barely enough to see by. I get up, and go into the front room to check the deck through the window, and lo and behold, there's actually somebody taking things away! I see 2 men carrying something between them. For a second I freeze, then go right back and say, ""There's somebody on the deck - call 911"", meaning to go do something else myself, but the others don't move - instead they look perplexed, like ""Who, me?"" So I do it myself, at the phone right in the middle of the room. I'm not actually sure I've pressed the buttons right because I don't hear a ring, but a voice comes on the line - and I'm not sure what she said. I hesitate, then ask if this is 911. She says it is, but she doesn't quite believe I'm serious. She says am I sure, and do I really want the police, something like that - she seems to know who I am, and is really dubious, as if she knows something about me that makes me unreliable and she shouldn't take the call too seriously. But in the end she says okay, and I put the phone down. I go through the room [It's as if there's no opposite wall, and it continues into another sort of building] and come to a steep place where it's darker and rather like a great marble hall, the upper reaches - or at least middle - and a series of very narrow, steep ""steps"", are cut into the space. I need to tell somebody here about the robbery, and I do - there's somebody taking a message to somebody else - and now I'm climbing back down. (You can't walk upright on these steps.)"
"282"	"(5/26/90)"	"I've just arrived at this place where Jenny and Cathy and I are going to do Bio-Energetics - it's a living room, with a couch and TV and all, but it's part of a place where people come, like a club or the Y or a local rec. hall, maybe. We've never come here before. When Bettye and I arrive, we get started talking, and Jenny is looking at us funny - then she says something like, ""Are we going to exercise or what?"" I'd actually forgotten, I'm quite comfortable just sitting on the floor talking. (I'd asked Bettye if she'd seen something on TV - maybe Twin Peaks.) So we get started, though not in our usual circle of up-and-down pumping. Jenny is experimenting with that yoga pose where you stand with one leg over your head and you grab your foot. I tell her that the trick is in the standing leg. I was going to say the hip, too, but forgot. For demonstration, I do it myself and find that it's actually easier than I remember. I touch my foot to my head, and then reach it higher and over; then, because it seems like fun, I bend forward and reach the foot all the way to the ground. I didn't realize I could do that, a very interesting feeling - not a real pose, of course, I haven't really stretched and placed everything, and didn't stay in the pose, but fun. I point this out to Cathy, who's watching. Shortly some other people come in, a couple with 4 little kids. They're not part of our group, and we don't know why they're here, but we figure we can live with them being here if they're quiet enough. We'll see. But then some more come, an even larger family, and they're not as quiet. Apparently they don't know we've reserved this room, and have come in for some meeting or whatnot, and now there's just too many of them. (The room has gotten a lot bigger, by the way - now it's the size of a meeting hall or small gym.) We're going to have to tell them we've reserved the room and please leave. I'm in a little apartment that a male friend lives in, and he's taking a shower before we go somewhere. I'm poking around, looking at his magazines and books, and his sister comes in. We don't know each other, so we introduce ourselves. She just popped in for a visit, and I tell her he's in the shower; we go over to the bathroom door and try to get his attention. We wave hands in front of the door and call, but it takes a few tries. She finally stands in front of the door herself to talk to him. She's nice, I like her. Dark brown hair like his, both good-looking, she's well-dressed, friendly, comfortable to be around."
"283"	"(5/27/90)"	"I'm at work. (Looks nothing like the library, it's a rather dim place with yellow light and nothing is recognizable except that it does seem to have open-office landscaping.) I've remembered the orange electrical cord I lent Ted for his meeting and didn't get back, and I ask him where it is. He says he let Theo take it away, he doesn't know what she did with it. So I ask Theo, and she's getting ready to go out of the office with this group of people on some errand, but they will be going near where she put the cord, so if I want to come along and fetch it I can. Even though she says this, she looks and sounds uncomfortable, as if she feels guilty, or shouldn't be asking me to join them. I get the distinct impression I'm considered a liability. But I want that cord, and I'm already pissed at it having been passed around, especially to Theo, so I go. We walk quickly, and go into the back part of the building, where the ""works"" are - boiler room, mechanical stuff, storage, etc. On one of the lower floors is my own storeroom where I keep that orange cord. We walk on concrete floors, sometimes they amount to wide catwalks because they're open to the lower floor, and there's many turns - it's like a maze back here. We seem to be walking faster, gradually, and I'm not appreciating it. I'm having to work to keep up and I have the feeling they're trying to lose me. (There's one guy that's really in charge of their group, and I can tell he doesn't want me along.) At one point I get stuck and have to stop for a minute. (Shoelace untied, or caught on something, or drop something, I forget.) They don't stop, but keep right on plowing ahead. I see them at a distance go through an outside door. As I get loose and go after them, I'm getting really mad. I go through the door, and see the group ahead of me, and call out ""THEO"" in my yelling-at-Rouse voice, very authoritative and imperative. I have to do it twice before they stop and I can catch up. I point out that I was held up back there, and it's hard to catch up when they've gone on ahead so fast. I'm looking fierce, and Theo's nervous. We continue around to the front of the building, where there's a driveway and parking lot. They go across the rows of medians, where there are hummocks and puddles because it's been raining. Now it's starting to rain again, even. People are out here waiting for buses, including Linda Thomas. I stop and she comes up to me and tells me about some other interesting new thing she's just gotten into, or hold of, or something. She tells me Jenny's been using this one particular thing (a fruit or vegetable) with this, it really works. While I'm out here, a girl comes up to say hello - she looks familiar, and just as I've got her placed as a LT graduate (who used to come and do things with us, but we haven't seen her in a long time) she says I bet you don't remember who I am, and I say her first name's Norma (right) but I'm sorry I can't remember your last name - she says that's ok. She's very friendly."
"284"	"(6/13/90)"	"I live in an apartment that's almost exactly like the one that I left, and there are at least 5 cats here. Tree, maybe Alleycat, and Rouse, for sure, but in addition there are some others, of various sizes, and they're quite recent, they've just come to live here for reasons unknown - they're not babies, but they're special, I don't know why. The fact is that some Arabs want them; they want them a lot - I don't know how I know that, except that it's a done deal, and it's up to me to try and protect them from being kidnapped. [I'm not sure abt. the sequence of events, so I'm gonna say one thing, and then another, and if it doesn't seem to work out, so be it...] Gary S. is here with me, he's just arrived, I guess, and I have just discovered that the Arabs have stationed themselves outside, sort of unobtrusively, but quite visible just the same, and I'm thinking I'll call the police. I'm trying to show them to My cousin through the window, but they're not that easy to see without also showing yourself. He's not entirely convinced of this, but just the same he can see one of them and there isn't any earthly reason for an Arab dressed up like that to be leaning against a tree down on the ground. So he - like My cousin will - admits (that it seems) this is true. I'm wanting to call the police, but for some reason I guess I don't, because they don't come - I think that we thought that they wouldn't, because after all it's just cats, and why would they want to kidnap a cat? See, I don't know precisely what they want to do with them. They may have some special use for them that they don't normally, but I can't gamble on that. They may even be wanting to sacrifice them for some reason, or do something terrible to them (and I won't sit still for that, because I like them). So I'm worried about what's going to happen here. Another thing is that I'm out in the car with my mom, and we stop at something on the order of a 7-11 for something to drink, and I'm needing to get back home because of the Arab situation. Something happens there, at the 7-11, that worries me - I don't remember what it is - but we have to get back in the car in a hurry and go on back. Lo and behold, when we come back, there they are, visible this time, and in fact I'm not living in an upstairs apartment now - this is a house, and there's a porch, and there they are sort of hanging around the front door. Now, the fun part is, they are just sort of idling there - my mom and I walk up to the front door, and I don't know what the hell they're going to do. I can't afford to be too scared about it, and it's important to get in the door, you know - so we just march brazenly through them (there's about 4 or 5), and they don't do anything at all. I get to the door, and move very quickly - we get in through it, and slam it shut, but don't get it slammed shut quite fast enough, because I guess what they were waiting for was for me to open the door, because they now try to force their way in the door. I can't hold it real hard, but there is a post - an upright, right behind the door, which is very convenient, because what it means is I can get up and brace my back on the pole and hold the door shut with my feet, which I do. I get the door all the way shut and locked, and they have to give up, which is great. Now, I don't know what the point was in them waiting for the door to be open, because after I look around, it's quite clear that they have gotten in and taken the special cats, which is a worry, and the next thing is that I'm worried about them coming back and also grabbing my cats. I don't know quite what to do about that at the moment, and what's also clear is that I have to try and rescue the other cats. I'm gonna have to find out where they are, and go and get 'em back. This is scary - but the fact is, that I don't know how dangerous it is, so it seems important to me that I might as well try. Maybe it's not as hard as it seems, and I cannot give up without a fight, basically. By the way, the setting for all of this is as though it were late afternoon or early morning - the light is not bright, though it is daylight, and there's that sort of mild gloom that you get when it's one of those times you don't have the lights on inside. You can see, like to talk to each other, or move around; you'd want to turn a light on to read by if you wanted to do that - it might even be trying to rain outside."
"285"	"(6/16/90)"	"I am in a neighborhood, where all the houses are different and they're all old, and really interesting-looking - there's a lot of green, tall, overarching trees - you can barely see the sunlight. It's really gorgeous. I am looking for a house, and I think I know what street it's on, but I'm not exactly sure which - I know which street it's on, I'm not exactly sure where the street is placed in this little area here. If I can find it, I know what it looks like. There is a large, mean, dog in the area; I'm wanting to avoid it, but I can't be sure exactly where it is, because of not knowing which street is which. I seem to be walking, but part of the time I'm riding, because my mind is telling me all these things about how I'm gonna handle this dog business - I am afraid it's just going to come up and rip me to shreds, is the main thing - another is that I can handle this - this is what I keep telling myself; the dog will not necessarily attack me, even though it may bark a lot, especially if I am riding on this vehicle - this may be enough to keep it from coming too close to me. It's not inside of a car, by the way, it's more like being in a jeep or something where I am exposed, but there is a moving vehicle under me. I think about the mastery that some people have over dogs and animals, whereby if you retain confidence and show them that you are not afraid and you order them to stop, or sit, or something like that, they'll stop attacking you, which is nice. Basically I haven't run into this dog yet, and I've come to the end of the street, where there's a cross-street, and decided to turn left, because I think the street I want may be parallel to the left and I go a couple of streets further and find that I'm coming to another dead end where it makes a right angle with the last street of this part, and that's definitely not it, I know that one is not it, especially since I can see the building at the end of the street, which is not a house - maybe a hotel, something like that - small place, and I know that I must be going in the wrong direction, so I turn around. But while I'm there I run into somebody that I know - friend of mine, I guess, who's with somebody else who's got a couple of big dogs - this is not the mean dog - I should call these mastiffs, or something that size that type, very big, stolid, dogs, and this person is not necessarily Dirk, but is like Dirk - he's just gonna ramble on here, as I join them to walk the other direction, and I listen to him go on and on about how these dogs are going to make his living - in hunting, in some capacity. I don't really know in my own mind while I'm there, where it is he means to hunt them, or what precisely he means to hunt - I think it's a fur-bearing animal - that seems to be the upshot of it - but while I'm listening to him go on about this I'm thinking, this is ridiculous, get yourself a real job, these dogs don't want to do all this for you - and he's talking as if these dogs are real ""killers"", _____ dogs, tough dogs, and I'm thinking, this is pitiful - they just want to be petted! They're really nice-looking dogs - I think they might be fun to have around, they don't look like they mean to be tough at all. I'm thinking about getting an opportunity to pet one of 'em - the great big black _____ thing that's walking next to me, actually. Frankly, I'm getting a little bit bored doing this in the first place, and I have got my own place to get to. So I sort of duck away from them after a while. However, before I do that, we have turned right and gone down one of these streets - having not found the house that I was looking for on it - this hotel seems to be where the business district starts right away, and the opposite side of it is more nearly city street. We have come through the kitchen, where there is this counter-thing running along where some cooks are working, it's a butcher-block type of thing, and I know that they cut meat and whatnot there, and prepare a lot of food. We have come up to this, and they're asking questions, like directions, or information, and I'm just waiting there. I've got this binder in my hands - in my arms, actually, a small stack of things - notebooks, etc. - and I lay them on the counter - as it were, you have your arms crossed in front of you holding these things, and just to rest my arms, I lay them on the counter, and then a minute later I snatch them up again, realizing, ""Oh hell, these things have got germs on them and this is a food preparation area - somebody's food's gonna be contaminated with this stuff, whatever it may be."" I'm really quite embarrassed about that - nobody has noticed it particularly or said not to do that, but I'm wanting to clean it off so that everything will be ok again, and they're still talking. This is where we part company, the guys with the dogs, and I'm gonna go on through the hotel here. I'm looking for Arsenio Hall - I'm supposed to have a visit with him. Maybe it's an interview (though I don't know what I would be interviewing him for), and I'm supposed to meet him somewhere - and the fact is that I run into him in the front hallway. This front hallway is kind of like a lot of little hotels that I went to in England. It's certainly no big flashy hotel - it's got this comfortable little lobby and a tiny service desk, and he is out there. I'm guessing he's staying here, and has just come down to do something at the desk. There's another person there, probably the desk clerk (or someone else associated with the hotel), and they're just chatting. It's night now, in this hotel, and there's this laid-back sort of attitude going on, where you just sort of stand around and chat. So, since I have run into him, I'm telling him what it is that I want, and we fix up that he's going to come along to the house that I'm staying at overnight, and visit with me there after a while. So I go out the front door, down some steps, and then I come to the house I'm staying at, which is my grandmother's house. (It's not the real Bigmama's house on Vanderbilt, but the street is something like it, and the house something like hers, only my grandmother is really like Grandmom, and later on that is exactly what I call her.) She is old - not especially decrepit - and forgetful and a little silly, maybe, but not helpless by any means - slow. We're upstairs, she's dithering over something or other, and I'm just helping her do something, and chatting. The reason I'm here, I think, is maybe because it's convenient for me to do something else, being here. I'm living in the apartment I have now, very satisfactorily, and I don't think that I'm in Grandmom's house just to help out - I think it's something to do with me. Now my brother comes along, and he has got a deal to say on the subject of Grandmom and me and the situation. She's gone downstairs, and he is telling me that I am going to have to move in here and take care of her. Apparently they have got this all worked out (""they"" being my other relatives, such as they may be), and I guess there's even a lawyer involved, that they've fixed this all up, that I'm to move in here, and take care of things because she is no longer able to take care of herself. Which is what they say. And I'm going along with this for a bit, feeling sad about it, and hurt, without really paying any attention to it. Until it dawns upon me a few minutes later, ""Wait a minute! Num - ber - one: I don't WANT to move in here! I have my own place; that is where I live; I want to live there; I like it; I have my life there, and I don't wanta move in here, and I don't see why you should tell me to do that. Number two: I don't even see how come she needs to be taken care of so bad. I don't think she's done anything all that drastically bad, maybe you think that she needs help, and that's all very well, but why do you think you need to tell me to do this? Number Three: I have you, and a cousin (and maybe another brother or sister or two - but I don't know - it's in my mind there's other siblings here), and just what is wrong with any of you coming to live here? What do you think it has to be me for? And I'm not gonna do it! How's that?"" He seems to be a bit disappointed, and to think that this is an idle protest, and it's not gonna do me any good at all, because it's a done deal - of course I'm gonna do this. The more it goes on, the more I'm aware that I am not. I am simply not gonna stand for being pushed around like this."
"286"	"(6/20/90)"	"I'm in a dressing room (or locker room, or a large ladies' room) putting on makeup, getting ready for a date. I've been by myself for a while, or with a friend, and a group of other girls comes in. They line up at the counter with their gear, and this one crowds in on me where I am at the left side of the counter. They seem to have just come from an aerobics class or something. (I haven't - I've just been at work all day.) She says something snotty and I don't actually reply, but it's also true that I was just finishing, and say that all she had to do was ask. I pick up my stuff - a whole makeup kit and large bag of gear - and go. This date is a set-up thing, sort of blind date, with Prince. He doesn't know who he's going out with."
"287"	"(6/22/90)"	"I'm at a LT - not sure if I'm in it or on team, it might be a focus course or not, but it's being held outside in a nice place with trees. The trainees are all on folding chairs. I'm going for a bathroom break, and 2 or 3 other girls follow me. The bathroom is in a rickety little building next to this open space where the trainees are, and the whole place seems to be fairly old, dates at least from the 40's, very country, may be (or have been) a farm, that sort of construction and fixtures. As I go into the bathroom, the others are not far behind, and I'm figuring we'll all come in together though I'm not keen on that, and as I step in I push the door to behind me, a bit harder than I planned on, because it almost shuts, and they stop outside, presumably because they think I want to be alone. I feel uncomfortable about that - I don't want to shut anybody out. Actually, I'm not alone anyway. Bill Cosby is in here, and he's being very talkative, telling me about his family, asking how mine is and how I am, all while I'm sitting on the toilet. It's in a partial stall without a door, so he can see me, and I keep my skirt (the big ivory one) pulled down around me. This is rather awkward, too, but it doesn't seem to bother him - actually he takes no notice and just goes right on talking. I have my pee, but that problem starts again, where I can't quite get finished - as soon as I think I've stopped, the urge comes back and I can't get up till a few more drops come out and then it starts over. I get wearier and wearier, all the while knowing the girls outside are wondering what the hell I'm doing."
"288"	"(6/22/90)"	"I'm going to a kind of flea market with Mom and Marcy. It's a bit of a drive out of town, and we got started late, so there's not a lot of time left. It's at least partly in a building, with corridors, and alcoves and rooms where people have set things up. I'm seeing some nice things, doilies and artificial flowers and china and even some sculpture, all white. Antique furniture, ladies in ruffled gowns. Odd sort of place. There's a larger space with a lot of empty tables, it looks like a lot of people have gone already. That's a little disappointing, but mostly we just think we'd better hurry to look at the rest."
"289"	"(6/22/90)"	"An outside room or porch, windows all around but shaded, a screen door, concrete steps outside, driveway, lawn, trees, next-door house, very suburban neighborhood, in here porch-type furniture, dark, crowded. There's a sort of refrigerator in here, has compartments, meant for a specific purpose to do with freezing things including live animals. I discover a kitten in here, I think it's not supposed to be here and I ask this guy that's around if I should take it out - he says yes. (He's in his 20s, blonde, husky - no scientist, but he's in charge of whatever it is we're doing.) So I get it out and help it thaw, and it comes to life just fine (as if this was a really normal thing) and starts to poke around. It finds the door and wants to go outside but it's not quite up to that yet, so I grab it - I need the guy's help - he's outside the door and he helps me get it back in and latch the door."
"290"	"(6/23/90)"	"I'm working in a plant where there are all these chemical-storage things and all sorts of safety precautions need to be taken. It's not a real big place; it's rather old, and the plant part is fronted by a little house - used to be a house, now it's a sort of large office with tables and files, etc. Reminiscent of the 50's, all rather dreary. Nobody's English, but the place seems to be in the center of London (well, if not the actual center, then at least well into urban stuff), and I've just changed apartments, and that's where I live. This place is mostly staffed by men, probably union men, who are very clubby and don't like management telling them what to do, or any interference in the way they do things, which is none too careful or efficient. I'm not management, but part of my job is safety control, and they don't like me already because I'm a woman. I've been trying to talk to this guy in charge about something that I've seen. It has to do with a yellow powder that's highly toxic, and I suspect it's leaking. He won't listen to me, keeps putting me off and evading. There are some others who know what I'm talking about, but they won't or can't get involved. I'm feeling very frustrated, with that nagging, foreboding feeling in my stomach. The day has worn on, and there's a sort of cocktail party after working hours, so everybody's stayed over. (Rouse is here with me, by the way, there was some reason she had to come along and I couldn't take her home in the middle of the day. There's also a stray dog I'm looking after.) I'm trying to work out how to get to talk to people about this problem while they're a sort of captive audience, I'm really concerned. A girl who works here beckons me over to a corner of the room and behind a door where nobody can see us. (The outside door is in the middle of the far wall - it actually faces north - and the door to the factory/plant is up here in the southwest corner; it's propped open.) We talk about this leakage problem a bit, but she doesn't think there's anything we can do, and warns me that I'm liable to get in trouble if I keep after it. I'm arguing that dammit, I have to - somebody has to, or something really bad is going to happen. We go into the plant to look at things, and Rouse comes along. Just inside the door there's this big thing all iron and great big nuts and bolts and suchlike - the whole place seems to be boilers and steel vats and stuff - this thing is maybe 4' high and has a bolted-down cap on it. Rouse jumps around it and I want to get hold of her, when I get a good look at this thing and see, not traces, but quite a lot of that yellow powder has oozed out of the lid. This is terribly dangerous. The stuff is positively deadly if it gets loose. While it's sitting still it's not too bad, but it can't get airborne. (I don't know if it's deadly to inhale or to get it on you.) We look at each other, horrified, and run back inside. I start yelling for everybody to get out, and they hesitate at first, but they do go. There is some question about whether I have the authority to do this, but I really don't care - it's in the back of my mind, and part of me wonders what will happen, but I go on yelling and herding people out. Finally they're all gone and I'm rounding up Rouse and the dog, getting ready to go myself. Down at the end of the room where the outside door is, is a bed and a television set. (Don't ask me why - it just seems like they're part of my personal furnishings, as though this were my ""office"", and I can lie around and watch game shows when I want to.) Under the bed is a small suitcase I've brought in to change from my outside clothes to work clothes because of my move (something to do with the reason I brought Rouse). I fetch it out and get on the bed to change clothes, which is basically from a big sweaty T-shirt to a cleaner one, and (put on? take off?) my big black boots (with heels). I lay there and watch TV for a bit, then realize I'd better get the hell out, so I round up everybody and go out the door. There's a little vestibule here, and it's night now, and now that I'm here I realize we've got more passengers than I thought. In the shadows of the vestibule is another cat, and now by George there's another dog too. Not the same kind, and I don't know where he came from, and I'm wondering how I'm going to deal with all these animals. My new landlady may not take kindly to 2 dogs and a 4th cat. Also, how am I going to drive the car with all this lot?"
"291"	"(6/29/90)"	"I'm at a camp somewhere - it's not just a resort, I seem to be learning something, doing practical things. All I know about it is the outside is nice; I'm kind of liking it here, but I've had about enough of it now. There are a lot of people here, some of them I know, some I don't. If it's not Sunday morning right now, then it's Sunday afternoon, and this guy who is like a counsellor - at least he's not just a participant either (we seem to have some official capacity, let's put it like that - we're not running the place, but we're not altogether guests, either) - and he has come back from somewhere. I expected a friend of ours to be with him; a young man who's kind of like Javier, in a way - he has that place, he's about the same age - sort of the new guy who's really good and everybody likes him and he's always around. And he's not with him and I'm wondering where he's gotten to. He's been off somewhere like to the store or something, on an errand into town, maybe. So I ask about him, and he says that he got called away, there was something he needed to go back for, and mentioning that it's about time I went back, too. He has a Sunday paper or there are some Sunday papers just now brought in - one of them is the Herald, of course, it's nice and clean and new and fresh, like Sunday papers start out - and of course I want to see the Lottery number, so I get hold of the paper and start looking in the front section. There's the comics the way they usually are, but usually for the weekday pages, inside the section, and they're also black and white (which the Herald's aren't at the moment) - anyhow, I don't get to the number before something else happens. This paper has a sort of a bug stuck to it - it falls out, and it's not just a bug; it's a ball of bugs. It's as though a bunch of these beetle-y sort of things have clubbed up together - maybe they've done this to hibernate, or something (I don't know why they would do such a thing, but they have), and they look dead; they look all motionless and dry. But just the same, even dead, I don't want to mess with bugs, so I figure I had better get rid of it. And it's a real challenge to scoop it up - the thing is maybe almost baseball-sized, real big bugs; they're orange, and shiny, and they literally are sort of side-by-side grouped together, making, mostly, a ball. There's a lot more than 5 or 6 of them, I should think. Now, I've decided I've got to take this thing away, of course, and so I scoop it up on the paper. The thing is, I don't do it quite there - for some reason, I have now decided to carry it to my mother's - so the next thing I'm aware of is being at her house. She isn't there; I'm curious about that and wondering when she's going to get back. [This is not my mother's house as it is in the real world] - this is more nearly like my grandparents' house - it's middleaged-old and has this ""rustic"" garage to it, that has your basic up-and-down door - it's cobwebby and musty in there, and somewhere along the line I've become aware of another ball of insects. This must have been at the house - I don't know where it came from. I've been into the garage, thinking I was gonna go into the house through it, and realizing they weren't there, went back outside to see what I could see there, and gone up on this sort of little porch, maybe to a side door of the house - it's right next to a large bush/tree - there's lots and lots of plants all around the house, in this nice summery sunshine, hot and all that - and this is where the other bug-thing comes into play. It's definitely alive - although I might have suspected that it was dying. I decide I had better get rid of it altogether, so I'm going to get a shovel and pound 'em apart. I go into the garage again, and first I see a short spade and pick that up - realize it's kind of small, look around again a little bit, find a real shovel, a long one with a good-sized blade on it, go back outside, and I find these things, and when I start pounding on 'em, it seems that I've got the short spade in my hand after all. Well, that's silly. So I put it down, pick up the shovel - which I have in fact got with me - now one of these things, that was up on the porch, seems to have been coming to life, sort of. That is why I got disturbed and dropped it. It was like it was giving birth to another bunch of bugs, which may have been in fact the case; on the bottom of the ball something looked like it was trying to break out of it, and I decide, ""We got enough bugs!"" (Don't ask me how I know that these were undesirable bugs, but that was my conclusion.) I am back here, starting to find the thing and pound the snot out of it, which I do. I'm sitting next to Nancy Gaines with a young girl who is sitting in front of us - we're with another bunch of people - she doesn't know us - we're visiting (and we may be sharing the LT, I'm not sure - but it's something we're there for that's new and unknown to these other people) and we haven't been entirely accepted yet. She's so far been nice to us, that's good - she's blond, looks like a nice kid. Nancy is (doing something like tying her shoelace) and talking about Kathy Carson - her name comes up in some way, and the girl says something like, ""Who's Kathy?"" We say one or two things about her, and I say, ""...and Nancy's gonna marry her!"" And Nancy says, ""Yeah! (something something) we're going to get married."" The girl is looking at us askance - she doesn't say anything, and I realize that this may not have been the most opportune moment to say that. But we did say it, and I go on to say something about what the girl has been talking to me about earlier. She has perhaps written a letter or something, - maybe it was poetry - maybe she was telling me something - all I know is, I know something from her that the others don't know, and I'm talking about her and how this is so interesting, and I quote from her a bit. The 2nd thing that I say from her that's a quote, I suddenly realize, ""Oh, hell, this is a direct quote of something that's privileged information, that's real personal, and I have not asked her permission to talk about this."" I am breaking confidentiality, and I am thoroughly ashamed of myself. I feel myself getting hot, and I'm sure I'm turning red, and I just feel mortified; looking at her, I'm saying, ""I am really, really sorry - I did not mean to do that."" Of course, she not realizing that I have a code of confidentiality at all, looks to me like she doesn't really understand what I'm so disturbed about, and that it really was okay with her. And she doesn't know that it might not have been okay with her - it hadn't occurred to her. I am really, really sorry about it."
"292"	"(8/1/90)"	"I'm with my family in the family house, an old, slightly ramshackle place [about the caliber of Melanie's mom's house in age and construction, but the neighborhood is more suburban] , not great big - though we're a pretty big family, most of the kids are grown and don't live there. I'm the next-to-youngest (I'm about 18 or 20). Patrick Duffy is my older brother, and he's been kidnapped and just been rescued and brought home, so all of us are here and having a sort of family reunion. Most of us are outside, getting ready to go someplace, and he's on the porch [ground level - small] . I've just come through the door, and our younger sister (she's maybe 9 or 10) behind me, and seeing him there, flesh and blood, alive and well, and I just have to hug him again. I'm feeling very emotional - we all just adore him, and we're a close family - I just want to hold onto him for a bit longer. So does my little sister, she joins in, and another one or 2 from the other side. Letting go after a bit, now I'm going back in the front door into the living room. [It also has a lot of the qualities of Melanie's mom's house - tacky brown/yellow flowered couch, fringed lamps giving off dull yellow light, tacky coffee tables, tacky knick-knacks.] There's a few other people in here - particularly, on the couch to the right of the door, is a fat old woman - she's from some European country, and I think she's Patrick's mother-in-law. She's a grump anyway, and she's glowering across the room at [Kathy ?] one of my other female relatives, who's standing talking to an older man (or 2), and she has a section of the newspaper in her hand that the old bat wants to read. She thinks she's supposed to be catered to, of course, though nobody else does, and she's spending a lot of her time pissed off. She looks up at me and I get the very clear message that she expects me to fix this for her, and for a moment I look from one to the other, askance. I find it rather amusing but I sure ain't going to look it where she can see me, so I just give a sort of polite half-smile and go on my merry way. I go through into another room, which is dark, and then to the kitchen, ditto. Outside it's almost dark, and the back of the house has that gloomy light. Somehow I know that something's wrong. It's just a creepy, ""off"" feeling, as if I know somebody was watching me, or something was moved that shouldn't have been. I start to worry that maybe this whole business isn't over, that even though my brother is back home, the bad guys may still be plotting something - maybe they're even hiding in the house, maybe they'll kidnap him again, or another one of us, maybe even me. Suddenly I'm uncomfortable being by myself. Now I'm in a neighbor's house [a rather basic suburban-type house] with a friend - we're not buddies, but our families have known each other a long time - and I'm waiting to see what happens next. This woman is grown, but she still lives with her mom and dad and kid brother; she's a little bit simple - maybe retarded, but could be something else. She keeps changing who she thinks she is, not her real name and where she lives and that, but she plays new roles every now and then as she changes interests. She'll suddenly latch on to something new and exciting, and pretend to be somebody else. Right now she's trying to be Robin to my Batman, sort of. (I actually am a detective - or something like it - but I'm more nearly Sherlock Holmes, I don't do Batman stuff.) We were out having some sort of adventure just now - she showed up while I was working on a case and she actually did help some, I figure I can be tolerant and let her indulge herself for a while, she'll change to something else anyway after a while. Meanwhile she's got herself a detective trench coat and detective slouch hat and looking very Bogart-like. So I'm sitting on the couch while she's telling her mom and brother all about it - her mom's been doing housework [she's pretty much of a drudge] and she's just going, ""Uh-huh"" (""big deal"") (""oh, sure""), ""uh-huh."" The daughter gets up to go into another room, and I call something after her, using her name, and her mother corrects me, saying, ""Oh, she's not (that) any more, now you have to call her (?)."" And I say, oh, I see, sure."
"293"	"(8/10/90)"	"I'm in a bus, just got on, and I'm choosing a seat toward the back. This bus is rather old-looking, and broken up into sections (actually it's not a lot like a bus, but more like a train, with cars & rooms, but not separated). I want a seat in the back because it's nicer there, more sunlight. Before I get settled, though, I want a drink of water. Around a corner there's a concession stand - actually a large counter, wood base and glass front, right out of the 30's or 40's, with a middle-aged man and his (wife? daughter?) running it. I thought there'd be a water fountain, but no such luck, and I don't want a Coke or anything, that they're selling. But I see that there's a dispenser bottle on one end of the counter - a black girl is using it (she's from a whole troop of ghetto-type kids that are occupying this side of the bus, bustling around the counter and being noisy) and I figure if you could get a cup without paying for it you could get some water."
"294"	"(8/11/90)"	"I'm in a hotel with a woman and a boy (my mother and brother?). We're moving, and staying here while our belongings are in transit - this is the new town we're in. It's a nice hotel, quite formal. We're going into the restaurant for lunch, which has a maitre d' and snooty waiters and tablecloths and stem water glasses. Mom is being officious, she's a little anxious about something, and keeps reminding us of things. (She's blonde, by the way, sort of your TV career-mother; the boy is a nondescript typical young teenage boy.) I go in with them, but I have to go do something - I'll come back later. [Where I go isn't clear, but it involves My brother, my real brother, who gives me some reassurance about something. We're in what I think is an attic-room, at least it's definitely upstairs in a building, and we're standing next to a window - all through, the time is midday, nice weather, bright sunshine.] When I come back, mom and brother are gone, but I'll stay and eat lunch anyway. I get seated next to this nice-looking man in a suit, also dining alone, who says ""hello"", and we have a pleasant conversation. I look at the menu - a fancy-restaurant menu, tall, with elegant script and no prices, heavy vellum stock, tied at the back - and order a pasta dish, something cheesy and unspectacular. It's good, but afterward I get the bill and gasp. This is a lunch price? I thought I was being conservative. The man next to me agrees that it's rather high, but he's used to it. I need to go out for an errand (I may have done this before finishing my meal), so I go into another part of the hotel through a side door. There's an area in the back with some offices, and I go past some elevators and around a corner, and there's a small office with a glass front tucked back here. Two people are standing in it, a man and a woman. There's some colorful waiting-room lounge furniture and plants, and a wall or partition behind them. I go in and talk to them for a minute - we agree on something, and I go back to the restaurant. Having settled the bill, I have a copy of the menu in my hands, which is odd because they took it when I ordered. (Perhaps it was on an empty table and I picked it up to look at it again.) Well, I think I'd like to take it with me, but I suppose they'd rather I didn't. My ""companion"" points out that perhaps I could leave by the back door, and I agree. So I do, and go quickly back through the corridor I was in before, and to the office. There's a back entrance just before the elevators that I could have used, but I'd rather not be that conspicuous. Now that I'm at the office, I see they've left and closed it up. I look around, and just opposite is an exit door, the sort of ""emergency"" exit that has a bar to push. I don't know if it will set off an alarm or not, but I'll be long gone before anybody gets there if it does. I step out, and I'm at the back corner of the building, next to the parking lot. I walk that way and go look for my car."
"295"	"(9/24/90)"	"I'm on a bus in the morning, got to get school - I'm late. School's just started and I don't want to be late, it's a bad way to start off. I look at my watch and see that I only have 10 minutes to get there - this bus won't do it, we've got to get off. The bus stops, and we're going to walk (or run), but we have to go through this house. For some reason it's the only way to get there. It's not occupied at the moment, I think - at least nobody's home - but there is ""someone"" there. I'm not sure if it's a human. This ""person"" has a riddle or question we have to answer before we can get through the house. It's on a sort of flip-chart that he shows us, lifting up the top page to show what's printed on the next. I feel frustrated, but I know this is the only way so I look at it and try to think. It shouldn't be hard. But we're running out of time."
"296"	"(9/29/90)"	"I'm at the office, checking the mail. I have an envelope, it's squarish, about the size of a greeting card, and thicker than usual. I look at the return address, which is Penny's, and I realize she's written me, and I'm thrilled. I also think that the thickness must mean that she's enclosed a copy of her jewellery price list - oh, boy! I'm just overjoyed. To think she'd be writing me already! How nice!"
"297"	"(10/10/90)"	"I'm motivating down the street on this weird little cart. It's kind of a cross between my ""back"" chair and a railroad pushcart: very low, made of wood (could almost have been made from an orange crate), you sit on it and pump this bar and it sort of scoots forward. It doesn't exactly have wheels but it goes, or at least it usually goes - just now I'm having trouble with it. I've come up to this corner to meet with my group - we're sort of entertainers, like street musicians (but I don't know what we all do) and Fred is our leader, more or less. We're just gathering together here to get ready for something, but I'm not staying, I've got errands and I'm letting them know. So I go on down the street on my little cart, and it won't ""roll"" - it just drags along most of the time and then sticks. I have to get up and pull it. I think I look real stupid doing this, and the others are probably wondering why I don't give it up, but I keep it up anyway. I go a bit further, very near my apartment, and run into Sandie, who's just coming this way. She's been staying in my apartment for a while - I've been gone, and I've just come back. She's saying to me that everything's been okay, she got along great, no prob, and she hopes that the landlady didn't mind that the rent check was a little bit short because she was real tight for money right now and she'll make it up later. This surprises me but not a whole lot because Sandie does actually pay her debts, and it should be okay - I'm thinking she only means 3 or 5 dollars. I ask her how much short it was, and she says a hundred dollars. Now I am horrified. A HUNDRED DOLLARS? You've got to be kidding! That is it. That is absolutely the last straw! You have taken advantage of me and I will not stand for it. You get your stuff and get out. You will not do this to me ever again. Et cetera. She's kinda surprised, and says she's sorry, but looks more bewildered at my reaction than anything else. We go inside (this is a complex, and has interior hallways), and pass by the next-door apartment. The lady who lives there has the door open and greets me as we pass by, she's a friend. I go inside, but I can't go all the way in - the entrance is through the kitchen and Sandie's moved a couple of tables into the middle so you can't get by. This apparently is because they're cleaning the carpet or something. Afterward, I go in my car to a friend's apartment - I have something to deliver to her. I knock, and there's a slight delay before she answers, and when she opens the door she doesn't look like I remember her. She's short, a bit stout, has medium-light brown hair. She's been asleep or something and isn't wide-awake, but shortly she remembers me, and says ok, bring the stuff in. I go back to the car - parked on the street across from her door - to get it. (This is some sort of printed stuff.)"
"298"	"(10/15/90)"	"I'm in my office building, having left the office for a break or an errand, and I'm on my way back. This place bears more of a resemblance to where Lori works at the museum than to the library, it's sort of a maze of offices and walls and steps and corridors, but nice anyway, there's light and air. I'm scooting along on my chair (my back chair, only with wheels), and I think people are going to think I'm crazy. I pass a couple of people in the drafting area who turn and look at me. I'm going through some unfamiliar offices because I took a wrong turn somewhere. I'm in my own kitchen, trying to trap a scorpion on the floor with a wad of paper towel. I'm really determined to get it because scorpions are so dangerous, and I've got to be real careful. I'd take it outside if I could, like the cockroaches, but I don't believe I can. It escapes me for a while but I get the paper towel over it and squash it - not very hard, but when I lift it up to see if I've killed it, there's nothing left but goo mostly. I didn't think they were that fragile."
"299"	"(10/23/90)"	"I'm at work - sort of - it's the library, but doesn't look normal. Our office is a sort of long alcove, and there aren't any desks - just chairs facing out, lined up along the wall, 4 or 6 of them. I'm on the end away from the wall, and my chair is different. (I guess it's my stool.) There's a rectangular carpet in front of me, rather Persian-looking, but it's pretty thin and flat. It needs to be replaced, and I've put in a request but no response so far. Joe Bearden comes by, to use the copier I guess, and he's the one who deals with these things, so I ask him about it. He says that some measuring has to be done, so I get out my yardstick and we go to it. The carpet isn't actually straight, it turns out; at the spot where it crosses the metal strip on the floor that divides our office it jogs a little bit, and also a bit further on. You can't really see it until you put the yardstick down next to it, but it does mean that the new carpet will have to be specially made to correspond. About this time I realize how late it's getting, and I've got a yoga class to get to. I don't have a car at the moment, and I haven't got another way to get there since it's too late for (the bus?), so I'll have to take a cab. The class is in a place I haven't gone before, it's being held at a middle school almost all the way to my Mom's house. I'm sharing the cab with a guy I know, and he knows how to get there, so he tells the driver, but he doesn't go that way. The guy says that's okay, it's just another way to get there, but the driver seems to prefer this one. Heigh-ho. At the school, we pull into a sort of enclosed carport, and I get out. I don't know where to go, but there are a number of kids about, so I ask a boy who's with a group on the stairs. He doesn't know himself, but says he'll go in and ask a teacher. When he comes back, he takes me inside to a room that looks like it belongs in a school, rather old and institutional. It's next to a sort of kitchen. The boy introduces me to a teacher who says I can wait here while he goes to locate the class, but his look and manner suggest he thinks it's rather odd for me to be here. And he says he thought the class was just for kids. Well, he goes off to find out how I can get there, and I start wondering if maybe he's right - is this just a class for junior-high school kids? Ooh. I may be very out of place here. (The class, by the way, is one of the regular City Yoga Center classes - I think Fred's teaching. I just haven't ever come to this one before.) The teacher is gone a very long time, during which I doze off for a minute. After a while of poking around bored, I notice that it's flat dark outside. Good grief, how did that happen? I look out the window - I listen - I realize that there's nobody here. A lot more time has passed than I thought. The class is probably even over by now. I'm also concerned about how I'm going to get out of here. If I can find a phone I can call Mom, but that also means I'll have to find an unlocked door. I go towards the kitchen door and realize I'm hearing voices. Walking into the room, I find 2 or 3 women standing in a group, talking. One of them looks particularly startled when she sees me - and as I start to explain myself and ask how I can find a phone, etc., she lays into me like nobody's business, saying, ""Don't you pull that stuff on me, I know all about people like you, you'd better get your butt right out of here"" - or words to that effect. I apologize for being a nuisance and all and try to talk again, but she starts in again. She's quite pissed. One of the other women starts to speak to me - without the hostility - and the first one goes again. By this time I've had about enough abuse, and I say so. I raise my voice and very firmly tell her I'm not going to take any more crap from her, I want a telephone so I can call my mother to come get me out of this place*. She clams up. Another woman (who I think came up in the middle of this) takes over and says she'll help me out, so she escorts me away. She's very nice, this person - she's rather short, with medium brown hair, nice friendly face and manner if a bit reserved. Next thing, we're in a bathroom; I'm looking at myself in a mirror and we're having a conversation."
"300"	"(11/16/90)"	"I'm the director of a play being put on by my little ""group"" - we're some sort of social or community group, maybe LT. This place is perhaps a local community rec. center, or otherwise a sort of borrowed facility - not fancy, panelled walls, not much furniture, several rooms. We're getting organized in here - it isn't easy, they're all standing around chatting, nonchalant. I'm not feeling at all confident - it's as if somebody else is in charge, and I'm only supposed to do a job when it's my turn, but I know I'll have to take over pretty soon... Eventually we go outside to rehearse. We're doing the play pretty soon and don't have all that much time to get it down. (I think we do it for real this afternoon.) There's a space nearby that we marked out to rehearse in on the grass (this is a public park, though there aren't a lot of people about). There's something (an archery target, I think) at this end of the space, and the actor we're watching at the moment is at the far end nearer the trees. This is Shakespeare, and he's in a costume, maybe Elizabethan, but I think a tad later frankly. He gets rolling, and while he's got it down quite well, he's declaiming in one of those ""Shakespearean"" voices like there's no tomorrow. Piffle. This really won't do. I'm gonna have to persuade him otherwise, and soon. He moves forward in the scene, and while he's up here near the ""target"" a couple of girls walk across the space at an angle and go over to a place toward the back and sit down, as if they were at a picnic. They're talking casually as if they don't even notice anything going on. They're wearing long dresses and have long hair. (I'm not actually sure if they're part of the scene or not - I think so.) About now I'm getting more comfortable with this director business, and I'm thinking it's time I put in my two-cents' worth. I do have ideas about how I want this thing to go, and I'm gonna take over now. Later (I think it's the same sequence) I'm going home, walking down a path - brick - through a pedestrian mall between some stores and offices. There are other people out strolling and visiting, very nice atmosphere. It's early evening, just beginning to get dark. I've got my purse under my arm, and something else with me (in a bag?). I stop for a minute to look at something, then go on my way. A short way further on, toward the street, having rounded a corner or two, I realize I've put my package down when I stopped, and left it. I'll have to go back for it. I hope it's still there. I go back, and there it is. I put my purse down to adjust how I'm holding the package, and go on again. I get almost to the street before I realize that now I've left my purse sitting right on the path. Anybody would see it - damn, I'm sure it won't be there now. Oh hell! I go back. As I round the corner near where I left it, I notice a sort of shelf on my right - the sort of thing you see in a restaurant or someplace ""decorated"", shoulder height, it might have plants on it. At the moment there are other things, personal things, on it, like a purse or two, and one of them resembles mine a bit. I pick it up and look at it, anxious, and of course realize my purse doesn't have a strap, and this one's rounded. I put it back down, thinking surely it belongs to somebody who's around and will think I'm stealing her purse. I turn around again and go a few more steps toward where I left my purse, and it's not on the ground, but I see on my left a table or stand with a woman behind it (large? black?) and by George it's a lost and found, and there's my purse on it! Hooray! I'm so grateful. I tell her it's mine - she listens to me explain and lets me have it back, and I go on back up the path, find the street at last and turn left, on my way home at last."
"301"	"(11/24/90)"	"In a hotel room with Lori and a woman she's recently met - Lori is wanting to work with her on something, but she's rather suspicious that she may not be what she seems. The woman is (or seems) larger and more powerful than us, and while she seems nice enough, there's a definite detachment there. I've just come to tell Lori I think this woman is dealing drugs and is going to get her involved with it. [I don't remember now how I found this out.] I arrive, we all chat for a bit, and I'm impatient because I'm sure she's going to find me out soon [someone else is coming? or a phone call?] and she may be hostile if she finds out. Shortly she has an errand outside, like taking out the trash or something, and I seize the opportunity. I tell Lori what I know, and while there is still some doubt in the matter it seems most prudent to get out now. We have to grab Lori's things fast (she's been staying here for a while - I don't know if it was meant to be permanent) and duck out the front door to the elevator. It's slow, and we get anxious, but it comes and we hustle into it, still clutching all this stuff with sleeves and things sticking out. Now we're inside we can pack it up a bit better. This elevator is actually a little room - there are tables and chairs and lamps, and a window to the outside (it's night, and you can see a bit of the city - we must be on the 10th floor or so), and there are other people in here - it's a bit like a waiting room. I wave Lori to a seat and I take another."
"302"	"(11/27/90)"	"Michelle and I are going into a small theater to see Tony Randall. We sit in the balcony and enjoy the first half of the show. Then at intermission I decide I need to change clothes. [I'm not sure if this is because I've spilled something on myself, or because I'm tired of wearing these clothes and want to wear something more casual and comfortable.] We just live across the street (apparently M & I are sisters) in a big house - we seem to have rather a lot of money - the house is tropical or Southwestern in style, red tiled roof, stucco walls, and the grounds are well landscaped - lots of yucca and patio-things, very nice indeed. Michelle goes to her room and does whatever, while I look for something else to wear. I know I'm pressed for time, but it takes me a while to get done. Michelle hears the intermission signal from across the street go, and says it's time - we have to go, but I'm not ready yet. I hurry, and she dashes off. I get finished, and go outside, where I stop (just for a second) to do something - I'm at a low brick wall, curved, around a sort of patio with lawn furniture on it (the wood kind with cushions) - and I see a man coming. I don't know who he is, and I wonder if I should stay around, maybe he's a burglar and if I leave he'll break in. I move off, thinking I'll avoid him, then I recognize him - he's our housekeeper or groundskeeper, he works here (he's an older guy with gray hair, nice-looking, rather dignified, butlerish). It occurs to me that maybe if I didn't recognize him, he doesn't recognize me and he'll think I'm a trespasser. Hmm. Well, I've got to get on, so I start to run - I'm sure the show won't start on time anyway, and I can see from here that there are still people going in (though that doesn't prove they're seeing that show). Before I get to the street, though, I remember something I've forgotten, I need to get my purse, I left it (in my room? on the patio wall?). Oh, hell - how long will it take to get it? Can I push my luck any farther? I hesitate for a minute, then give in and run back for it."
"303"	"(12/8/90)"	"I'm with a group of people I work with at a large stadium/auditorium, shortly before some show or event is about to start. The others are talking about another of us who isn't here, something has happened to him - something pretty serious, either he's dead or is having some big trouble - and I don't know what it is. I was gone when this came up, and I'm feeling quite left out and frustrated, because they're assuming everybody knows and not explaining what's happened. Our boss comes along, and he asks me to go off with him, and I tell him what's going on. He seems to have a bit of trouble dealing with this sort of personal thing from his staff, he's very uncomfortable - he does try to explain a little bit, but the whole thing is awkward for both of us. We go along to the inside of the auditorium. Everybody is getting organized, locating their seats, getting their groups together (this is some sort of corporate thing - all these groups are people who work together). We go to one of the tiers and stop where he greets a man that he knows, and they talk. Apparently my boss means to sit here with the other group, but nobody's taking any notice of me - I can't tell if I'm meant to sit here as well, or should I go to be with our own group? I look around for them, and think this place is so big they must be out of eyesight, but then suddenly I discover they're sitting right behind us, a tier up. Hoping to remind him, I tell my boss, ""Look! There's our group right behind us!"" and he turns - there's also a pillar behind so he has to lean out a bit - and there they are sitting just up there. Good. That's reassuring, at least, I can go right up there. Later: I'm at a hotel that's in an area where there's a lot of other hotels and businesses, maybe it's not far from an airport. I've been here before, at a hotel not far up the road, where some other episode happened like a murder mystery or something. This time I've had car trouble - the water hose [same thing that actually happened yesterday] , and this psychiatrist has come to help out. I was at his office with a friend and he drove me back here while she stayed there. We drive back to his office and I park the car in front while he goes in to get my friend and his secretary. It's after 5, and they're getting ready to go out, they're all dressed up. However, as my friend and I go to get into the car, I notice another puddle under the car and more steam coming from under the hood. Oh dear, not again. I say to everybody, ""We have another problem"", and we're all disappointed. The psychiatrist is frustrated - they really wanted to get on but it looks like sticking around to help me out again."
"304"	"(12/11/90)"	"I'm at work, and we're having the staff Christmas party today - hardly anybody's working and the whole library is decorated (looks rather like a department store - high ceilings, serious glitter, great big displays), and everybody's dressed up. The lights are dim, the whole place is a giant cocktail party. Bonnie and I share a desk, and she's actually working - a couple of guys are here to be interviewed (not for jobs, I think - it's something else we do). I've rented a movie for some of us to watch, we wanted to see a Christmas movie, and boy this was the only one left, practically - I get it all set up, and this one girl says, ""Boy I hope you didn't get _____, I have seen that a hundred times and I sure don't want to see it again."" Woops. Well, I think I'll just look around for something else to do for a few minutes here... I go back to the desk but these guys are just now ready to be interviewed and I have to get up again. I go a wall or 2 away, and sit down, and Brad Brown shows up for a visit. He does this just about every year, I think, and I'm really glad to see him. I sit and watch and listen for a while, while he visits with various ones of us. Shortly I'm on the 5th floor where the staff association party is in the staff room, and as I come off the front elevators I see all these folks, they're all doing the real cocktail party thing with drinks and long glittery dresses, and tuxes. When I turn to go around the microform tables I hear loud music from behind me, and turn to see this sort of procession coming in from the elevators. They're midgets, couples arm in arm, stepping out in time to some pop music. Then I notice the camera equipment, and realize they're making a music video. After the midgets, a girl singer has come out and is wailing away with a mike while everybody's gettin' down. I decide to sit on the floor and watch a bit - I actually lie down, propping myself up on my elbows. Once I'm settled I find there's a group of people sitting in a ring right in front of me - and right after that I grasp they're all more or less at eye level with me. And immediately after that I realize it's because they're all midgets! That's funny. After watching a bit longer I go on into the staff room, and there's another singer in there - actually rather a big-name entertainer, ain't we uptown? Quite crowded in here. Later I'm at home with Ruben (we live together) and we're wanting to go to the Christmas party but we have a plumbing emergency. We got hold of a plumber, and she came and she's finished now - thank Heaven - but it's a quarter to nine and probably too late to think of going now. We settle up with her (she's rather tall, blonde, and good-looking, good figure - wearing khaki coveralls) and thank her, and ask for one of her cards - we only had her phone number, not an address, and don't know how far she had to come. Would be nice if she was local in case we need her again. She's very nice. I allow as how I need some stamps, so if we're not going to the party how about we go out and get some at the post office? We do that. Outside the building is a stamp dispenser that's a sit-down console where you put in your money and punch buttons. Rolly and I are talking away while I feed a dollar bill into the machine. It starts to work, and then the change starts to come out - but a whole lot of change comes out! I don't even realize it at first because I'm distracted talking to Rolly, then I see this shitload of change. Not small stuff, either, lots of quarters. Must be $30-$50 in here. I poke at it a bit, wondering how I'm going to pick it all up, and thinking maybe I should count it out by type, but a car pulls up and a couple of other people arrive - they're here for stamps too, and they'll be wanting to use the machine. O dear. How do I pick all this up without making a lot of noise and letting them see? They'll probably want to share - or maybe they'll expect me to turn it in - maybe I should - really I should, of course - but geez, you know, I really don't have to, no one would ever know. There's a piece of paper here, and while I'm dawdling (hoping they'll get impatient and go away) (knowing there's no good reason to expect them to) I draw it casually over the pile, and then I notice the machine's belched out a whole bunch of stamps too. O boy. Well, well. Now what? About this time (while I'm still making conversation, but now I'm inserting a lot of ""uh...""s and ""er...""s) I notice something else odd. It takes me a minute to get it, but then I realize that there's light now, dawn. How in the world can it be morning when just a little while ago it was a quarter to nine at night? Have we been here all bleeding night?"
"305"	"(11/1/90)"	"I'm in training with a group of other people, about 6 or so, more men than women - they seem to be mostly younger than I am. All of us are in excellent shape - we're learning special skills from an older man, he's a sort of guru. I think we're all training to be superheroes. I have a mutual attraction going with a couple of the guys, both very tentative and innocent. One was already happening, and just tonight in class this other one started making overtures, and I'm quite taken with him now, too. He's really good-looking: tall, muscular, long hair, sweet. (None of the guys are musclebound apes.) Class is just over, and we're getting ready to go home. We train in a private school, I think all boys. I get the impression they're not crazy about us being here, maybe they just want to get in and use the gym. I've turned to a table to pick up some of my things, and one of the girls asks if I'd like to ride with her and some of the others. I say no, because I'd gone earlier to get my car so I'd have it here, but I'm actually sorry I did that now because I'd really like to go with them."
"306"	"(1/4/91)"	"I'm in a house. I may live here but maybe it's a long visit, I'm not sure. The people who live here are friends, not my very best ones, I don't know them really well, but we're getting along fine. I have the front room for my bedroom. Right now the others have gone into another room that opens into mine and shut the door. (This includes several people, I think it's a couple of married couples and another friend or 2 - I'm thinking only one of the couples lives here and the others are just pals. We do mix, me and them, but not constantly, so they're doing their own thing at the moment while I do mine.) This room wasn't meant for a bedroom, probably a dining room, so it's not completely isolated. Lori and Renee come to visit, and while I'm not looking they set up a ""Christmas tree"" for me - not a real tree, but made out of some odd things and it's just wonderful, I'm thrilled. It's sitting on a counter/shelf affair, and I also find they've tucked away a taco salad for me as a present. How neat. It's enormous, and good-looking. I start to dig into it, and they leave. I eat some of the stuff off the top, there's several layers, and eventually uncover some lettuce I hadn't known was there, that's great! I was thinking it was going to take quite a while to eat. About this time the others come out of the room and sit around in my room. I think I'll spend a few minutes on the porch. There's a door from my room, and I go through, thinking I'll play with Doggie a bit, she's outside. Just as I get out, she's running across the street chasing something, maybe a cat. It's a very busy street, she shouldn't be out loose, and I call for her to come back, but I'm anxious that she be very careful. She is; she looks for the traffic and waits till it's clear, then runs across and bounds up to the porch and I give her a rub. She's so nice. Suddenly I hear a noise down on the ground - I hadn't identified it as barks or growls, but when I look I see a group of 3 or 4 dogs getting mixed up with each other and maybe about to start a real fight. I'm disturbed at this, and want them to go away. I make what I mean to be a loud noise and clap my hands, they do stop what they're doing. All but one of them move off, but one - presumably the instigator - looks around and in a flash jumps up on the porch. He's bigger than Doggie, and black, mean-looking. He doesn't attack but skulks around acting threatening. I know I don't want to antagonize him and probably shouldn't make any sudden moves, but I'm scared. I stay still, and call out to the people inside. It takes a couple of tries because at first I wasn't loud enough, trying to be careful. The woman who lives here comes out, seeing the situation, and she's not afraid. She says to me I'd better get inside, so I step back and reach for the screen door - there's another door that I'm closer to - and let myself in carefully."
"307"	"(2/16/91)"	"I need a curtain fixed or changed or put up. Bruce Mulkey is here helping me with it, and he asks me for a screwdriver; he's in the bedroom. I start for the kitchen, and stop to turn and ask, ""What kind?"" He says Phillips. I go to the bag in the kitchen pantry where I keep my tools and pull out screwdrivers. The first 2 are straight - I wonder briefly if a Phillips is in here, but the next thing I get is one. I stop for a second on the way back and when I get back Bruce isn't there anymore, but My ex is. He's in the bathroom doing something with the curtains there. Now, Bruce had been going to borrow or substitute something from one of the curtains in here for the one he was working on in the bedroom, but what My ex seems to be doing is putting up the new curtain in here and taking down the old one. There was a regular-length one over the toilet, under the shelves [for no reason at all - it's just a wall there] , and he's taken that down and put a little short one up, just over the toilet - it's about 6"" long. It looks silly. I realize I forgot the screwdriver, don't know where I've left it, and go back to look for it, wondering what on earth's going on about the curtains and what to say. I find it where I laid it down on the way through the living room, and I'm surprised - I hadn't realized I'd only brought the blade. (Apparently it's one that can be fitted into a handle, part of a set, though it's quite large for that.) I rectify that and come back to the bathroom. My ex's nearly finished and I don't know what to say to him. I certainly didn't want what he's done, but he'll get mad if I say so when he's doing me a favor. I wish he wasn't here at all - Bruce knew what I wanted and would have done it right - you can't depend on My ex, and he always thinks he's right, doesn't want to be criticized."
"308"	"(2/17/91)"	"I'm in a theater where a rock band is about to play. One of the guys in the band is my boyfriend - we haven't been together very long but I'm quite fond of him and it's not a hot & heavy affair. We're still quite shy of each other. I'm sitting in about the 3rd row, center - he got the tickets for me and some friends - and the lights are on while we're still waiting for the place to fill up. Which it is, mostly filling up with teenage girls. I don't feel out of place, but a bit conspicuous. The band is still setting up onstage (the curtain seems to be open) and I get up to go talk to my boyfriend. He's assembling something on the near side to the stage steps on the right, and I squat where he is and talk for a minute, just asking casual questions about what's going on. He doesn't mind. I really like him, and I'm pleased that he'd want me here. He's blond, quite young-looking, real nice guy. I cross the stage for some reason (with him?) and I'm there for a minute or so more, while they're finishing up, and now the stage is set and it's almost time to start. They tell me I need to get back to my seat. I turn, looking for the best way to do that, and then decide to go back the way I came. I feel very conspicuous walking across the whole set now that it's complete, now it seems I don't belong here. (I'm not sure if the curtain is raised or not - it feels as if the audience can see me.) The place is about full now, and the general audience buzz is still loud. I look for my seat, can't find it at first, then I realize somebody's sitting in it. I go up to her and say, ""That's my seat"" - there's no time to be polite or solicitous, the show's about to start. She hesitates for a minute, but I get a bit more forceful, ""Come on, that's my seat - go away"", and she does. Looks a bit surly but I don't care. I sit down, full of anticipation and excitement."
"309"	"(2/18/91)"	"I'm outdoors, in an area with a lot of trees and open space, away from downtown, though you can see it over the tops of the trees. [Something is happening that involves mention of a hospital.] I'm going to walk up to the street [and do something, maybe I'm going for a car or a cab or an airplane] . As I walk over a slight rise, I can see more of downtown and the power lines that crisscross the air. On one of them are two figures, much larger than life but somewhat smaller than parade balloons - one's Batman (black suit and cape, like the movie), and the other one's female, and they're lying on the wire, embracing as if they're making love, but with all their clothes on. She's got long dark hair and dark clothing. I don't know precisely who she is, but I accept this as quite normal. It's apparently some sort of promotional stunt for the next Batman movie. What it appears to be is two real people inside some sort of giant costumes, and they operate inside them as if it was themselves. As I walk, watching from time to time, they get more vigorous. Out of the corner of my eye it looks quite real. Finally their humping gets real exaggerated, and they raise up in the air high enough to turn over backwards and fall off. As you might expect, Batman ""flies"" down, doesn't drop like a stone, and goes out of sight behind something. I'm still walking on, and now I see the two of them standing on a rise, their arms out, facing more or less my direction, their mouths open. They're singing, but I'm too far away to hear. More of the promotion. Up in the sky, there are little private planes from time to time - actually quite a lot of traffic - and now some of them are towing banners that say, ""Batman"". I pass by them and come to Lloyd's house. Lloyd lives right on a main street in a sort of industrial district; next to maybe an auto salvage yard, across from an empty lot, like that. It's part of a group of houses, though, an interconnected project a bit like condos, maybe, and the road by them goes from the street back, past his house, into the complex. I go through his house and speak briefly to him and a woman friend who's with him. [Whatever was going on where I started out, they are part of, or at least they know all about it.] They ask if there's anything for them to do, and I say no, I'm just going on out to get [the car?] . About now, I notice what I'm wearing. It's a sort of baby-doll top and underpants, seems to be blue or black, something dark, but quite short, nearly doesn't reach my thighs, and suddenly I'm very self-conscious. I could do something about it, I guess, ask Lloyd or the other woman if I could change, or something, but I don't want to appear unsure of myself, or scared. So I go on out, wondering if they're thinking I shouldn't be going outside dressed like this. I step onto the sidewalk, take a few steps, stop and think about it some more, get concerned whether Lloyd and the woman can see me dithering through the window, take a few more steps past the window, stop again. Agonize a bit more, then give up and decide to go back. I walk down the drive next to the house, not looking at it so as they won't see me retreating, and pass the house till I come to the end of the building, where there's a carport and then another bit of matching building. At the back of this I turn in between the houses and meet a boy, maybe 10 or 11. He's new here, just hanging out, and I talk to him for a minute. [I find myself explaining to him how these houses are arranged, that this back part is a laundry (very nice, too, completely carpeted and even lounge furniture this end) that's shared by Lloyd and the guy behind him.]"
"310"	"(3/2/91)"	"I'm in a sort of back alley or somewhere dark and hidden, meeting up with some creatures that I've come here to work with - they are at war or have been attacked/conquered by some people, humans, and I'm helping them. These creatures are animals, little ones mostly, furry mostly, and nice guys. They have their own way of life and everything, they've done nothing to harm anybody, these humans are just bent on taking over and enslaving the little guys because they're little and they think the little guys aren't as good as them. [I don't know for sure if this is another planet but I sort of think it is.] The ones I'm meeting come, quietly, stealthy, and we talk about what to do. (I'm not alone, I think, there's another person with me - it may be Lori.) We go into the building we're next to - it's a sort of warehouse, and there are rows of storage shelving with things on them. It's dark except for occasional lights on the wall, meant as sort of night-lights or security, I guess - the whole place is dim and has a mysterious, suspense-drama look. The enemy is somewhere in here, they're coming this way, looking for the little people they know are in here. We spread out and get ready. Suddenly they're upon us, and a battle starts. Everybody's running around the stacks, people are yelling, it's chaotic, and bit by bit we retreat. [I don't know what kinds of weapons are being used, and I don't know if anyone's killed - don't think so.] The fighting lasts a while, but eventually everybody's out except me and my companion, we're staying behind to see what we can find out - we're going to pretend we're part of this group. They're pleased with themselves, thinking they've won again, and start setting up tables and equipment for a meal, they're going to celebrate. [Gradually the character of this scene changes. The ""military"" people become people I work with, the warehouse becomes the library, and the meal they're setting up becomes a catered dinner for the staff.] There's a table right in the middle where some people are already sitting, and I wonder if maybe I should sit there, or are they expecting somebody else they know? I hesitate, and don't want to draw too much attention to myself. This looks like the head table and maybe that's where I should be to hear the most, but I might be conspicuous. Then someone suggests that we can both sit together at this other table, the last one in the corner. Good, fine, we go there, sitting at the far end*. There's a lot of conversation, we're all having a pretty good time, but I'm getting hungry, we've been waiting for them to let us know the food's ready. At some point this table's developed walls around it, it's in a side room. Finally we decide it's been long enough, and venture out to see what's going on. By George, everybody else is eating! We'd better get started. First we come to a sort of appetizer bar where a blondish woman is serving dips and crackers. It's pretty depleted. I take a little plate and get a few crackers, dunking some of them into a white dip. Not very exciting, but a start I guess. (The server also looks bored and unaccommodating.) Nearby I can see a salad bar but I want some more substantial food, so I go on around this station (which is backed up to a wall of sorts - the whole place is sort of an open hall with partitions, and I couldn't see past the appetizers) to where there are tables for the rest of the food. But they're taking it away, most of the tables are cleared already! I'm horrified and furious. I go up and ask what the hell they're doing, we haven't eaten yet. This thing's not supposed to be over for another (20 min? 2 hrs? I'm not sure), either, they can't do this. Obviously there's not all that much left, anyway, but still, I'm hungry and I'm not going to sit still for this - I paid $7.95 for this meal and if I have to go out and get my own I damn well want my money back. The servers tell me the guy in charge has just gone down to the (lounge?), I'll have to talk to him. The others (from my table) are not as worked up about this as I am, but Lori and I go after him; I'm working up a fine rage."
"311"	"(4/12/90)"	"I work in a store/sales showroom with Harry Anderson - it's a big place, I guess it's full of furniture, big things, high ceilings. It's early, just about time for customers, and I need to change clothes just as people are starting to come in. I take off what I've got on and people look at me funny - including Harry, and I'm rather concerned about that. Harry and I are good friends, maybe even lovers or close to it. I really care what he thinks, and he really cares about me. There may be something wrong here. Maybe they're uncomfortable with me being nude, but it's really not so unusual. I'm somewhat self-conscious, but I won't be out here long - I'm gonna go back in the office/private area and get some clean clothes. I get a T-shirt, but it's got something on it so I pull it off and get another one. I need to go back out for something and wonder if I should go now with just the T-shirt on, or put some pants on first. I'm thinking the customers might be uncomfortable if I didn't. Next: I'm at a sort of resort/retreat place, going to attend a conference of women. We've already arrived, checked in. had orientations, all that. Some of us have been out sightseeing, shopping in the town or something, and we're on our way back (I think we've stopped at a cafe for lunch) and we're late, so we rush back on a sort of train or subway. We get out at the front door of a sort of school/campus hall, and go up some steps, through glass doors and down to the room where the meeting is. There's a guy in a suit and a couple of other people to meet and guide people in. We get there and find seats. We're all at tables across the room, a large room with a setup at the front for the meeting leaders. It's not bright in here, the light is rather night-club-like, grayish. There are some lamps in the front and on the sides (small ones). There's some activity going on but it's not something we're all doing, so we're just waiting at the moment. I'm trying to hear what the people up at the front are saying but it's hard to hear [like it was at Friday's last night] and I keep missing bits. At some point, something stirring or exciting is said and a lot of us stand up, enthusiastic, and I see that some are holding out their arms, and their hands are glowing with energy, a light blue color. I don't know what that's about. These women seem to have something I don't; there are a lot of powerful people here and they're about a powerful purpose, but I don't think I'm in this league... As things calm down I'm lounging in my chair, flopping on the table, and this doesn't seem appropriate, my friend next to me says so, and I agree with her. I straighten up, and for some reason stand on the table... After a bit some of us go out again, or there's a break - as we go out we're walking down the side of the building, there's a passage here and the grounds next to it are pretty, dropping off somewhat with yucca plants and whatnot all green. Down at the end there's a walk to the building - a dorm I guess - where we're staying, we're heading down there. Beyond the building the earth is all torn up, mounds of earth where they're going to build something probably. It's been raining and there are big pools all around. Off to the left, coming around the highest mound, is the other path that would curve up to the building, but the near part is all under water. We've stopped to talk - me and a friend plus 2 others. A woman with red hair and khaki pants and a vest is coming around the bend, and she looks at the water, which I'm thinking is too deep. We call out to her, ""You'll have to go back - it's too deep,"" but she decides she can wade in it, so she steps forward - and promptly slips, falling in up to her shoulders. Yuck."
"312"	"(4/26/91)"	"I am going to visit Lloyd. He lives in a house not far north, and it's a nice day, I'm out pedalling on my little cycle/scooter-thing, so why not? I'll just go all the way to Lloyd's house. It's a nice ride but long. This machine I've got is not as efficient as a real bicycle but it's okay until I come to a hill. So it's a challenge. I get across, though, and come to the development where his house is. It's kinda nice, with curvy streets and some nice plants and hedges. Lloyd's house is neat and trim. [Smaller than his real house and close to the sidewalk.] He lets me in - he has to go next door soon for a dinner party, but we visit a while in his back bedroom [the house is also furnished more comfortably, less showroom-new than his real house] - he's working on something back there. (I notice that he looks heavier, more nearly stocky than usual.) After a bit he has to go away, and says I can stick around if I like, even till he comes back and we can visit some more. But I decide to go after poking around a bit. I take my scooter-thing out of my bag (it folds up very small) and start to undo it as I walk to the door, then decide I'd better wait till I'm out on the street. As I get outside, though, I find it's gotten almost dark. Street lights are on. It was late afternoon when I came, I guess it would be getting dark, and that's not going to be fun. Hmm. I'd better not. I'd better pick another route, maybe a flat one if I can - the hills are hard and slow. Actually from here I can't get away from hills, there's no way to go that's completely flat, but I settle on going up Northwest Highway and down Skillman - that'll be okay, at least it's straight, and there's only the one long hill, I can walk up that, not so bad. I step out onto the sidewalk and hear a commotion up the street. I look to my right and see - my word! - there's cows in the street! 3 of 'em - no, one's a bull. And they're huge. Poking around under the street light. Some people are down there as well, and I realize these are escapees from somewhere and the people are trying to get them to go back. Apparently it's not so easy - they're so big they're dangerous, especially the bull, who appears to be temperamental. They look black to me, though it may be the silhouettes I'm seeing from the lights overhead. I have some vague idea of helping, as if I should call out, ""Here cow! Here cow!"" or something. As if I could then get them by the collar and lead them home. Hmm. Not so realistic. Still, I feel compelled to make some noise like the other people are doing, so I shout out something, and though it wasn't really loud enough to have disturbed them, just at that moment they get agitated - the bull jerks his head, raises up a bit and swings around and it looks like he's going to start running. I figure I'd rather not be out in the open when he does this, so I duck behind a hedge. I wait for a bit while things settle down and then go on in the opposite direction. I'm starting to cross a yard at the end of the street, and suddenly here comes an animal. I can't quite tell what kind of animal it is - it's very large (at least Great-Dane size), furry with sort of coarse, brownish hair, and a strange face - narrow, it ends in a rounded, camel- or rabbit-like muzzle. It's ambling toward me, slowly but surely, and I have no way of knowing that it's dangerous. I figure it's a cat, a really big cat, and if so I'd do better not to run away from it. O boy. Actually there's 2 of them, the other's coming along on the other side of a thin hedge next to me - they're both just casually coming forward, no facial expressions, no indication of what they're about, but they're so strange. As the near one gets closer, I doubt again if it's a cat. That mayn't make it less dangerous, though, and I decide my best course of action is to be invisible, so I step into a space in this hedge and pretend to disappear. Next I meet a couple of little kids - a boy and a girl, brother and sister, 6, 7, 8? They have just been dropped off here and they're meant to be visiting somebody, but don't know which house it is. I'm taken aback by this - it looks very much as if these kids have just been abandoned. Well, I'd better see them taken care of, so we go back to Lloyd's house. As I'm going up to his house, the group next door is just coming out, and there's Lloyd with some other friends of his. (Interesting to see him in that setting.) At this point I notice that he has his beard still/again. That's also making him look different. I introduce the kids to the group and explain the situation. Lloyd actually looks embarrassed, as if he hadn't wanted to get his neighbors involved in something like this. Too bad; some of them get right on it, particularly one couple, and we march right into Lloyd's house and start handling things. The wife and I are in the back bedroom (which now looks different somehow, more furniture) and start making up extra beds for the kids. She goes out again, and I do some more. I've been picking at a pimple on my chin (left side), and it has come to the point where I've pulled the skin off the top and I want to squeeze it. I go into the bathroom - just to the right outside the bedroom - and lean into the mirror, squeezing away. I don't accomplish much. I think of something I want to tell the woman (or ask about), and I call out to her while I'm standing there. She comes in, and walks behind me, saying hello to her husband, and asking what we're both doing in there together. I'm startled, now that I turn to the right and see him in the bathtub - briefly, before I turn my eyes away. I hadn't even noticed him when I came in, and he'd been so quiet I didn't even notice he was there! Eeek! He's a bit self-conscious and she thinks it's funny."
"313"	"(4/26/91)"	"[I'm doing something with a group who may or may not be SCA - we're dressed up, and doing some singular stuff, but I'm not sure it isn't for real.] I've been sent to a house where an SCA revel/council/court is going on. I'm meant to be a hero, here to help them do something. This house is a bit like a brownstone, has steps leading up to a big front door, could've been very grand. I've come alone, and I'm received as an emissary. They seem glad to see me. I've got on masculine clothes, rather Elizabethan I think but hardy. I'm greeted by the leader [I don't know his title - may even be a king] and clapped on the back. We're going in to dinner first, I understand, then we'll confer. I follow them down a hall and outside to a small yard where there is set a long table for a meal. There are already a number of people seated and some serving, and I stop to speak to a few of them, and I'm introduced around. As I come to the other end of the table I start to look where to sit, which I presume should be near my host, but he doesn't seem to be here, so I'm not sure I should sit down yet. Shortly he and the entourage come back in looking for me - we're not eating at this table, there's a room further on we're going to. I get the impression they wouldn't sit with these people - they're like the servants and commoners - and they think it unsuitable that I should have thought we'd be sitting there."
"314"	"(4/28/91)"	"I am looking, from a seated position on the floor, around a partition at the legs of a woman. They are beautiful, perfectly formed and flawless. She's standing with her legs apart, and as my eye travels upward, noticing the loveliness as it goes, I see the space right between her legs and even see the little bit of flesh at her genitals that comes down, a small pink protrusion, also flawless, heartbreakingly beautiful. [I'm not noticing hair at all - actually I think she has pubic hair, but it's very fine and light.] I look up further, seeing that her body continues to be lovely, and now I see that she's looking into a mirror - she is actually Julia Roberts (with her hair long again) and she's looking at her breasts. She's just had surgery (I don't know for what, but it was cosmetic) and she's looking carefully at the black stitches, the redness and slight bruising. She touches them very lightly, and the look on her face is concerned, apprehensive, a little fearful, not sure she should be worried - she's been reassured that everything's going to be fine. It's very sweet, really. I feel sympathetic, warm towards her. As I'm looking at her, I slide out a bit around the edge of the mirror so I can see upward at her face better. There's a window not far behind her, curtained with sheers, so there's soft, diffused light (nearly my old green light), and there's a green plant nearby, maybe some flowers. I'm sure the mirror (it's a full-length oval, standing mirror) is in an ornate gold frame."
"315"	"(5/4/91)"	"I'm at work in some kind of office - I don't know what we do, but it might have to do with theater. There's a number of people here, at various kinds of desks and tables in an open room with windows. [There's been more before this, and] I've just had some kind of accident away from here, where something glass exploded in my face. It was a kind of safety glass, that didn't all fly everywhere or I would've been all cut up, but very fine pieces or grains did fly out with great force, right in my face. I was a bit stunned for a minute, then decided I'd better take a look at the damage, so I went to (the restroom?) mirror. There aren't any cuts, but my face looks strange, white, brittle, as if there was a thin top layer on it, like a peel-away mask after it dries, but loose. That's scary. I don't know if there are pieces of glass embedded in my face, I don't know what exactly the damage is or what I should do. I think I shouldn't touch it, that might do more harm than good, I'd better call a doctor. I go back to my desk, which faces the windows and most of the people here can't see my face. I talk to 1 or 2 of them, but they don't see anything, or at least don't say anything about how I look. I wonder privately if that means my face doesn't look that unusual to them, but I can still feel it and I'm still worried. (It feels sensitive, brittle, uncomfortable - something's going on for sure.) I start to look up a doctor; then I realize I've got a card in my purse (or somewhere here) that someone gave me for a doctor she recommended. I find it and pull it out, a standard business card. I think about rinsing my face - would that be a good idea, if there's glass in it, shouldn't I be getting it out? But how would I do that, maybe it would aggravate the injury to have water running over it. As an experiment, I reach up and lightly touch a spot on my right cheek, to see how it feels - I brush very gently over the skin a bit, and can't tell anything much, just that it's sensitive and sort of dry, flat-feeling. Then I pick up my hand mirror and look. It doesn't start to bleed, on top anyway, but underneath the skin, capillaries start to open up, bleeding internally. I can see the red blood running in a vein, this way, then that way. As it comes to the end of a vein's route, another route starts right next to it. Oh, dear. Eeek. I get up to find somebody to help, I want to see somebody in particular. I run into Bettye Short and a man, behind a partition which serves as a sort of hallway, where the restrooms are. They're talking, and I don't want to interrupt them, so I wait a few seconds for an opportunity, then ask what they make of my face. [I am not remembering their reply if any - it seems as if they advised me to call a doctor right away. Next, I am wondering how it would be if I immersed my face in water, ever so carefully and slowly, so as not to put any pressure on it; maybe that would give the opportunity for the particles to ""float"" out. This last, however, may have been after I woke up and was trying to get back to sleep.]"
"316"	"(5/8/91)"	"I'm just pulling up to a day-care center that's in a large house, in a nice neighborhood, probably Central area. It's got a big double (or triple) driveway and a high brick wall - not too high, maybe 6 feet, but enough I can't see what's going on beyond it. Several vehicles are parked here, and I pull up behind a car on the left, where I can see through the gate. There's a large garage or other outbuilding straight ahead. I see some men (presumed) with hoods on, and guns - 4 of them, I think, and one of them is towing a kid with him, maybe 8, 9, 7? Shorts, brown shoes, striped T-shirt, dark hair. Clearly this is a kidnapping, and I'm about to be right in the middle of it. Looking around as casual as I can be, I back out of the driveway, trying to be ever so quiet. [Notwithstanding that a car always makes the same amount of noise.] They don't notice me. They're very occupied, and I'm being careful not to draw attention to myself. I figure I'd better go call the police. Once on the street again, I see there are a couple of other people - they look like ""punks"", dressed very colorful, punk-rock cliche, orange Mohawk on one, etc. They're standing further down the street, as if they were lookouts, and in fact they accost another car that's driven down the street and stopped at the Stop sign. They threaten, then start beating on the car with these heavy sticks they're carrying. (They don't have guns.) I pause, wondering what to do next. The guys with the guns will be out soon, I've got to get away. I wonder why the person in the car doesn't just drive off. [I also have the impression that the driver is on the right-hand side of the car.] That's what I figure I'd do. The masked guys come out on the street now, and I poke around in the car as if I've lost something; anything to keep them from thinking I've seen them. So I drive on down the street and avoid the punks, and now I've got to call the cops. I think, maybe I should just drive to a police station - where is one? The only one I can think of is the substation on Northwest Highway - that's too far. Just find a phone. For some reason I'd rather phone from somebody's house, and rather than stop at a pay phone maybe I should go to Dan & Lynn's house - is it closer than mine? No, not really, better go home. (These thoughts are being thunk near the corner of Central & Mockingbird, where the Eckerd and La Madeleine are.) So I get home. I live in a really nice house on a really nice street, west of Central, in the Townships. Green street, lots of tall green trees, thick grass, big bushes. It's not bright sunlight here like it was before, it's overcast, been raining, trees are dripping. (My house is gray brick or stone, with a dark green, low roof - lots of weathering but in excellent condition.) I pull into the driveway and notice something's wrong. My word, there's a whole new house on my lawn! It's smaller than my house, but no little cabin. It faces my house, it's set back next to the sidewalk and a tall bush/tree-thing is near its front door. It looks like stone; not a match for my house (except in color), but a nice fit in terms of style. It looks as if someone meant it to look like a manor house in the woods, out of the Middle Ages. But how could it have been built so fast? It wasn't here yesterday, I've got no idea how it got here. This is ridiculous. I get out of the car, figuring I'll take a look at it, but I hesitate. Those masked kidnappers may have followed me, you know - this whole thing is very suspicious, it could be a trap. I go up to the door very carefully - the door is open, and I'll take a peek inside. There's a mailbox next to the door, I can see now, and there's a white corner of something showing in it. Will this explain something? I can see through the door that there's a pool in the whole visible end of the front room - a sort of landscape affair, I guess you can bathe or relax in it, but I think really it's meant to suggest a sylvan glade with a nice pool, for the look and sound of it. Now that I'm close enough to see, it's not stone at all, or any such thing - it's inflated! This whole house is some sort of portable, temporary structure. How bizarre. But it looks perfect. The ""stone""-look isn't like big stones, but more like shale; layered rock, and I feel it, it feels molded. Geez this thing must have been expensive. I take the envelope out of the mailbox - there's a card in it, and it's from Dan, Lynn, Peggy, James, Lloyd, Vince, and several of my friends. This is a present from them! [For my birthday? Not specified.] They all wanted to get together and get me something nice, they knew I'd love this. (Boy they're right!) I'm not going in, though. Not till I talk to the police and check things out - the bad guys could be lurking in there. So I go on in my front door, and wait while Rouse and Tree (who were with me in the car) take their own sweet time getting in the house. Rouse comes in once, then goes back out before I can get Tree to come in. Alleycat (who didn't go with us) waits by the door with me. He's not sure he wants to go out."
"317"	"(5/19/91)"	"I'm in some kind of a team race with various ""legs"" and things you have to do. We're behind. It's close to the end, and we've finished a leg. There's a break while we go see what we're supposed to do at the finish, which is inside something, as if you go down a wide-open hallway, make a turn, and then you're in a big room/auditorium-like, and there's a bit of an audience. It's lit only in places, as if for a show, open and blank between the audience ""bleachers"", up to a wall. We're supposed to run up to the wall to finish. Back at the last stop, we get back in gear, I think we're running but I'm not sure, and one of us is missing or falters or fucks around or something, so there's no real chance of us winning. We get to the line in the middle of the room, where [I think] we all stop and just one of us runs to the end. But the person who's supposed to do that has bugged out. We (the rest of us) stand around in confusion for a minute while the other team runs on and wins, but I'm real anxious that we should finish and I fervently call out stuff like ""But where is he? We've got to finish! Come on!"" And get all worked up. I make a sort of false start to run myself, and the others just stand there, having thrown in the towel, it's all over anyway, there's no point, and so on. We stand there looking glum. I'm terribly embarrassed. I know we've lost, but I feel awkward, unfinished, terribly self-conscious. We should finish the race, but now we'd only be drawing a bunch of pity if we did. There's this flamboyant woman (middleaged, lots of dark curly hair, jewellery, rather Gypsy-like but with bread) who's part of the staff who put this on, and she comes forward (she's not the emcee, but does things to draw attention to herself anyway) and offers, flamboyantly of course, to run the last bit for us. But it's all over now, it would just be one more awkward thing, we'd just like to become invisible, even the audience is ill at ease. So she comes off it, and even says, No, I guess that sounds a little patronizing, doesn't it? And she quickly trots off, mumbling something about going to the bathroom."
"318"	"(5/20/91)"	"I'm somewhere with my brother and another guy, friend of his, in (perhaps) an office building, we're talking, occasionally I look out the windows and see the place next door. It has some signs on it, it might be a store or something, well known to us. [This is an old-fashioned place, these buildings are maybe from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 2-3 stories, brick.] Just now I seem to think my view of the building next door is moving, sliding sideways. That can't be right. I look away again for a bit, then back, and it still looks different. I look away again and take part in the conversation, but a minute or so later when we look again, the building's gone. We jump up and run to the window, and see that it's being hauled off by a truck. [It's just been hitched up to a cab like a giant trailer, and pulled away as if from a parking space.] I'm amazed, but my brother is very disturbed. He's sure it's being stolen - he runs out, going after it, I guess [or to call the cops] , shouting behind him for us not to drive his car. His vintage car is here [something big and bulbous from the 40's, early 50's, he's restored it, it's quite a prize] , and he's very touchy about other people handling it, even me and his best friend here. Well, this best friend of his (reminds me of the kid from the Pepsi commercials) is the let's-do-it, impetuous type, and he says, let's go after it in the car. I'm dubious, but likewise I think we should do something, and while I have lots of misgivings about this guy's driving, well, better him than me if anything happens. We take off."
"319"	"(5/21/91)"	"I'm in London, stopping over on my way somewhere further east (in Europe), and I've come to visit some friends at this school. It's a trade school or something like that, adult students, I may have gone here myself at one time, I'm quite familiar with it. I get out of the cab from the airport - it costs 20 pounds and change - at the front steps. This school is in a building in town, it's not off by itself anywhere; there are high steps up to it [the building reminds me a bit of A like a resturaunt] . It's quite overcast outside. I go on up and inside. Later, I'm coming out again as school's finishing up for the day. I'm talking to a young man, we'd been having a conversation inside and while I'm waiting for my friends I'm walking out with him. At the corner we get separated; there's quite a crowd of people, and I end up having to wait for the traffic light. I think he'll be waiting at the bus stop across the street, I'll catch up with him. But when I get there he's disappeared altogether. Hmm. Well, that's funny - I'm a little disappointed, he's a nice guy and I was enjoying talking to him. I suppose I'll go back across and wait for my friends. Rather than go back the way I came I cross to the other corner. It's pretty close here, narrow streets, but crowded with people and cars. There's a traffic cop [looks like your typical New York-style cop with a uniform jacket and white gloves] with a whistle and a strap across his chest, directing traffic. There's a little shop on this corner, and the street is blocked off with some road-works going this direction. I cross over again past the cop - since there's no cars coming this way, we don't need to wait for him to let us go. Now I'm talking to a woman on the opposite side of the street about a self-help book (either I have it with me and she sees it, or (this is a little shop) I've picked it up and am thumbing through it, and she remarks on it. She says it's really good, and recommends it highly. I say, thanks, that's good to know (and something about the library - can't remember exactly but may have been, ""I can't get everything I want at the library all the time"")..."
"320"	"(6/8/91)"	"We've caught a woman agent and are transporting her back to (Russia? not named but I have a picture of this place being eastern Europe and we're taking her north). (I don't know what my role in this is, but) Sharon Gless seems to be in charge, and she marches this woman around to a truck - it's dark and there are street lights on, or parking-lot lights maybe. Sharon's wearing a trench coat, and has a gun. This truck is a special prisoner truck. One side is clear plastic, or vinyl, flexible, and the back end, too - it makes a kind of see-through cage to transport prisoners in so that people can see they're okay, and who they really are. There are no openings except for the ""door"" slit, which is underneath a metal frame-thing on the left side. When you do some latches and things it folds down and you can slide through the slit and get inside. We're getting it all set up for the woman to go in. Everybody's calm and purposeful, somewhat grim, businesslike. Not much is being said. Sharon goes in first to check things out, then the woman goes in. (Now there's a blank space, and the next thing I see is) Sharon Gless is sitting in the chair, alone, the truck is moving, travelling through the dark streets; apparently the woman has overcome and outwitted her and escaped, leaving Sharon in her place to be delivered right into the middle of enemy territory. She looks like this is all just dawning on her, very concerned. Credits start to roll over what I see, as though for a movie. Before: ""We"" (unidentified others) have stopped somewhere on a journey, driving, through some open country in a foreign land. There's a break in what had been mostly trees and hills, to a bit of plain, sandy earth with scattered little trees, very short. Someone tells me why they grow like that, it's very strange, there are these rabbits that live here, and they stay under these trees - I'm not sure if they eat off of them or just take shelter there, but the sun is too hot for them and they scamper from tree to tree. The seeds get on them and then drop off elsewhere so they don't ever grow close together. I find this fascinating, and the plants are quite nice, there are several kinds of little flowers. I take a walk a little way into this, looking at the plants, and I see (and hear) there are also little birds sitting in the scrubby trees. That's cute. I look closely into one and see what I think is a chick, a fluffy little yellow bird. It's just sitting there, I guess it can't fly, and as I look, it moves a few inches to the end of the branch and falls down. It's only a little way to the ground, maybe it's not hurt - I wonder if I should pick it up but decide I'd better let it do whatever it can normally - let nature take its course."
"321"	"(6/11/91)"	"Robert Urich is also a gourmet chef, and he's gotten into a bet with a famous-chef friend of his that he can do something just as fast his way as his friend can. They set up a private contest, and Robert wins. All quite friendly, but the friend puts on a little miff. Robert has long hair at the moment, which he is lately wearing in a ponytail. I have been sent to go get something - his trophy? - and go to this building with an outdoor patio or something, next to a bit of parking lot, a level up, maybe head-height, and as I skirt this there's a fluffy white cat and I'm hearing (or singing) ""Grizabella"". I have the idea this cat is called Grizabella; I think, it's kind of a matter of taste, huh, somebody thought she was a glamour cat. But she is pretty. Inside, I'm looking for something in Lorren's apartment when she comes in - I'm surprised, I thought she was gone and I find myself thinking she thinks I shouldn't be here. Then I go to collect the (trophy?) and Robert Urich comes bustling in to get it himself, and I'm confused, but he's never one to do things the simple way anyhow - he's always like this. Later I'm going somewhere in a neighborhood and I see 2 guys I know, one of whom says something that the other should know, but as I pass him and call out, he doesn't hear me or doesn't respond. Typical of him. Later, I'm talking to someone (who's probably a therapist) - Jill and her roommate have just been here, and their problem is Jill's gotten a job managing a rock band and her being up all hours is bothering her roommate."
"322"	"(6/13/91)"	"I'm in an apartment, fancy place in a high-rise, occupied by an Hispanic gangster and his wife - a tall, gorgeous airhead with big hair and flashy clothes. The place is decorated in mobster chic, but rich. He's not home, and I'm not supposed to be here - she's not supposed to have visitors. She's a nice person, though, and she wants me to be here, I'm telling her something or teaching her something, we're just getting to know each other. Her husband shows up, however, and I have to hide. Eventually I can sneak out. She gets him distracted, and I'm pretty good at this, so I get on back to where I live. Where I live is a sort of group place, an organization. The building has offices and meeting rooms, a lounge, a kitchen, etc. Open, light oak everywhere, glass doors, big windows. I say hi to various people on the way in, and go into a little office-room near the front. While there, I see this black guy (large, tough, in a suit) coming in - total stranger, looking around like he's hunting somebody, and I'm worried. Maybe the gangster's found me out and had me followed here, and I'm in trouble. I lay low till he passes out of sight and go into the lounge where some of my friends are and warn them. While we're standing there talking, suddenly I hear a loud - really loud - ""bang"" and feel a blow to my head. For a minute everything goes very vague, and I don't know at all what's happened. My head feels as if something's hit the front of it and gone out the back, I have the idea it made a big hole in the back of my head - I can feel the pressure. I'm sure I've been shot. Nobody else seems to have heard anything - they're just the same as they were a minute ago. Maybe I'm dead and they just haven't noticed. I think, if I'm dead maybe I can move out of my body and look at it, that would tell me what's going on. But it doesn't work. I'm still right here, not dead, no bullet holes, and my friends haven't heard anything happen at all... Well, still, we have to go back. Linda and I are gonna go back into the apartment - she's got to measure some curtains. Actually, we've done this before more than once, and I keep on having to hide behind furniture - frankly it's getting harder, too. If this keeps up I'm gonna get caught. But we go, driving in Linda's Mercedes. She parks it in front, under the awning and we get out - there's 3 of us, me, Linda, and another girl, shorter, blonde. I've got something in my hands: left hand, a sort of handbag of Linda's, a sort of green-flowered fabric roll; right hand a folder or papers of some kind. I figure I'd better ditch 'em, they could get in my way. I've only gone a little way toward the front door, so I let them go ahead while I go back to the driver's side of the car. We've left the doors ajar so we can get in fast and make a quick exit if we need to. This makes me nervous in the first place, and now here I am putting something inside that could get stolen. I lean in the back door, thinking to put the handbag under the front seat on the passenger side, but I can see how easy it would be to spot if someone looked. I push it as far forward as I can but boy I'm uncomfortable with it. But nuts, I've got to get on inside and I can't draw any more attention to myself either. Geez. So I get on out of the car, debating whether I should at least shut the doors, but the others are expecting them to be open, and we may really need to hustle. More dilemma. I'm out, I straighten up. I see a man in front of me with a gun. Oops. Not good. I look around. I see plenty of people about, and I figure that's helpful, I'll just back up and mingle, he can't shoot with all these people here. Except that another guy, behind me, an old man in a suit, also pulls a gun and points it at me. I'm taken aback. Then a little girl with pigtails next to him does the same thing. I'm really worried now, and I stand real still for a minute. Until I somehow manage to get away and start running - I run behind the building and climb over fences, getting away through peoples' back yards and around houses. I've been doing this a lot lately, I'm pretty likely to make it."
"323"	"(6/21/91)"	"I'm at a big the Festival. The part where I am is near some water, and in between is a long pole stretched between 2 trees, being used to hang clothes on. These belong to several of us girls who work here, it's our costumes and regular clothes too - a lot of them. The pole is really weighted down. I'm going past it to go down towards the water, and I notice and hear the pole slip. It's just wedged against the tree and it's finally given way. It hasn't slipped too far yet, and I try to push it back up but it's just too hard for me. (This is a tree branch maybe 4""-5"" around - must be 30' long.) I'm worried it's going to slip all the way, so I figure I'll tell the maintenance man - maybe he can help. He's around here somewhere, an older guy, with a tool belt and all, stereotype. I go on a little way to where there's a kind of shed next to the water and it's for photography. We have a staff photographer and I'm her assistant - which doesn't mean much, just that I have to take over when she's gone. But what they tell me when I get down there is that she is gone - sick, I think, whatever it is it's temporary, but I'm in charge now. This is not good. The fact is I know very little about photography, just learning, and I'm sure I can't handle it. But everybody says, ""You'll be fine, there's not that much to do."" Oh, boy. I start back up the rise again. I see the maintenance man, he's been talking to the landlady. I hadn't wanted her to know about the pole falling down in case she'd think it was my fault. So I wait till they're apart and I tell him what I saw, come look. As we get up there, though, I see that it has come loose and fallen off. There was a cap of some gold-color metal on the end which was fixed to the tree, and the pole's just come right out of it. [It wasn't like this earlier - just the end of the tree branch wedged tight.] Now he's got to fix the whole thing. I hope he doesn't think it was anything I did. I walk up the hill a bit further, where there's a sort of LT going on - there's the team area setup in back, with something behind it - a rise, a fence of hedges, something. We can sit on some rocks that are here, and hummocks, as well as chairs. Before I get settled, though, I think, ""You know, I haven't been down to that area by the front gate that goes off to the right - I'd like to go take a stroll down there and see what's there."" I remember how it looks, and that there were some cute things in a shop there before. Also: I'm sewing a button (or something) on a shirt I'm wearing, and at the same time taking a few stitches in my face where I've been cut. [I don't know how that happened.] There's a pretty bad gash a couple of inches long right next to my lip (on the left side? Am I looking in a mirror?) and every so often I'll take a stitch there. When I'm finished I look, and see that the stitches (with that black thread) aren't very visible, and I can smile and open my mouth okay, it just stretches the last stitch a bit."
"324"	"(6/27/91)"	"I'm in a friend's house - a fairly big place, she has more than 1 brother or sister (though I can't say how many). I've come here last night late, or early in the morning, I was with somebody else and we got put to bed - I slept in the living room on the couch, there are actually several of us girls here as guests and the place is filling up. I've waked up after everybody else - they wanted to go out early and I stayed, so I've got the place to myself. It looks like morning - yellow light, sun coming through the windows, it has that early-morning feel. I poke around some, looking at the house (a nice but fairly typical suburban house - nice decor, they're pretty well-to-do) and I go into the kitchen, think about breakfast, etc. I also go down the hall - my luggage is in one of the bedrooms somewhere - and suddenly discover my friend's dad is still here in bed. He's rolled over, with the sheet pulled tight around him, and I'm really startled, I thought I was alone and here I am moving around, maybe making noise and waking him up. O dear. I quietly go back to the living room. Shortly the others come bustling back in. They're all bubbly and chatty (like typical teenage girls), and we're making some sort of plans for something else later. The dad gets up and comes out, all dressed. One of the other girls comes in, going on about her car - she has parked it under the house, and now there's no way to get it back out again, she says we have to cut a hole in the floor (this floor - the living room, where we're sitting). I'm sitting facing her, listening to this (there are other conversations going on in the room), and I find it amusing - ha, ha, look what you've gotten yourself into - I say, ""Are you crazy?"" and go over to get the dad to come and talk to her about this. I explain it to him sarcastically, and he gets pissed at me. He turns and looks at me over his shoulder as he's facing her, a look of big-time disapproval, and says [something to tell me to go away - not mean, but diplomatically forceful, he means it] , and I'm crushed. I didn't think I was behaving so badly, and I sure didn't mean to make fun of her - I think maybe he thinks I was making fun of her because she's black (she's the only black person here). I wasn't. And I'm really hurt. I want to get away, and I go down the hall to the girls' bedroom, where there are several beds (including a bunk bed next to the window). I sit down on the bed next to the window, which has a lot of large pillows all over it. I move a couple so I can lay down somewhat, and get sort of wedged next to some of them, but I don't care, I can't be bothered to move them all. Actually, it's quite comfortable this way. I feel a little better. Some of the other girls come in, still talking about what we're supposed to do, and they gather around me, as if to be sympathetic and let me know I'm okay. I'm still feeling isolated, and I appreciate them for being nice."
"325"	"(6/29/91)"	"I'm in an old house kind of in the country (we're sleeping over like at Lorren's - she's here, not sure who else). The place belongs to somebody's family. They've moved out, maybe somebody died - it's been a long time and everything was just left here, or some of it anyway; and there's going to be a garage sale or some such thing with the rest. Lorren's here partly to clean things up. There's a lot of bits of furniture, rather a jumble. We're just getting up in the morning, poking around. A guy has come to visit Lorren, she's showing him around, he's English. I am in a position in the living room very like in Lorren's apartment, and I get up and look at this piece of furniture near this corner of the room (where there are 2 doors - one's the front door, don't know about the other - one's open a bit). I think it's a desk, this thing, with a typing stand sitting loose next to it. An old piece, maybe antique. I sort of clamber past it, giving the stand a spray of some wax-cleaner, and since I haven't got a cloth I rub it with my hand - all very casual, sort of by-the-way. As I finish, I say to this other woman who's in the room, ""There! If that isn't a hand-rubbed finish, I don't know what is!"" Looks kinda nice. I'm curious how it would have been attached to the desk, since it doesn't have an open end. As I look closer, I see that each piece has a little ring-catch toward the bottom (looks like the ring half of a hook-and-eye latch). So I figure you hook them up with some kind of little hardware piece. Looking at the ""desk"", I realize it has some odd pieces inset into the top. I examine these, and underneath and discover, by George, this isn't a desk, it's a sewing machine! Golly! Upon getting it open, I find there's not actually one in it, but still it's pretty cool - nice little dark wood piece. I remark upon it and say that this is very interesting because actually I have a sewing machine - I'm thinking maybe I'll take this thing home. I wonder how much it would be selling for. I think I want to get out from behind this, and the corner is kind of blocked off - I consider if I can get out the front door, maybe I can go around to the side, but figure that won't work. (I had shut the door.) While I'm here, Lorren comes back into the room with the Englishman - he's all bubbly, making fun comments about decorating the place, and he says here's Lorren all fixed up now to put things to rights, have a look - she's found something in the other room and put it on, but I can't see because I don't have my glasses on. I don't know quite where they are, and hunt around, saying well, hell, where are they? And I find an earpiece, put them on my face, and still can't see - by this time I realize she's got some sort of wings on her back, like fairy wings, but I can't see them clearly. I complain, say, wait, wait, these aren't the right ones (they're my reading glasses) - and I look some more for the right ones, they should be nearby someplace."
"326"	"(7/5/91)"	"I'm in a gym or workout studio, at the entrance end where there's some furniture, and along with a few other people, I'm looking up on the wall at a red flag. It's just solid red, on velveteen, looks like, and it's a kind of trophy for my brother (- although he's a little mixed up with My ex). He's just gotten his ""belt"" in some form of martial art - or similar physical skill - and they give you this to display. (I guess that makes it a red belt.) He's very proud of this, brought us to look at it for a surprise. I'm pleased for him, but not especially excited, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to just standing here and looking at a piece of red cloth. I wonder how soon I can get away, without hurting his feelings. Besides, I have to go to the bathroom. There's a class about to start [I think it's a yoga class, and it's unclear whether I'm supposed to be in it or not] and I go past them, trying to be unobtrusive, to the bathroom at the other end of the room. (There are windows down here, letting in some soft midday-light. This is an oldish place, probably in a school. Everything's used-looking.) I go in and push the door to, but it won't latch. It has a standard brass turn-latch on it, and when you press on the door it seems like it goes in, but it doesn't. The toilet is just a little too far away to hold it shut comfortably. This is a problem. I start to sit down anyway, hoping nobody will come into the line of sight of the door (it just stands open maybe 6""-8""), but the whole class is called down to this end of the room for a demonstration. They file past, and I can see their faces. I try to make the door latch again but it doesn't work."
"327"	"(7/10/91)"	"I'm at work, sort of - lunch hour or break, I think. The ""library"" is in some kind of warehouse-y place, a number of things under one roof, including this little shop, or kiosk, really, that sells cutesy decorative things, gewgaws. It's run by a couple of women and mostly staffed by them, very suburban-businesswoman, you know the type, that wear tasteful flowered dresses, they're on the tall side and very well-groomed. And slightly mean. They have a young guy working for them, kind of a stock boy/clerk, and while I'm there I talk to him. The others are somewhere nearby. I'm particularly interested in some miniature kitchen tools they have, they're mostly plastic but I have something in mind that they'd be useful for, and I'll probably buy some. Especially I like the little measuring-spoon set - it's like mine, only different colors (mostly red though). I'm looking for more in the next bin. On the main bin there was a sign that said ""$5 for all"", and I'm not sure it means $5 for one complete set of these, or $5 apiece (unlikely - they're just cheap little plastic things), or $5 for the entire bin. I believe I'll ask, but as I turn back towards it, the sign's gone, and the boy is putting things away because they're closing up. He's not sure what to tell me, either, but says he can ask the others. I tell him not to bother, and start back for the (library). I am nearby to a back door, the heavy sort with a bar you press down. Becky Crow's just coming in this door with several large cold-drink cups. She's picked them up for her staff - some are drinks, some smoothies, and there's too much of them for her to manage and the door too. I offer to help, taking a couple off her hands, and she asks if I'll take them down to Lisa, who's just coming around the corner at the end of the ""hallway"". She stops at this cart sort of thing, and I bring her these drinks while Becky gets reorganized."
"328"	"(7/13/91)"	"I'm in the kitchen at (Peggy and James' house - although the sink faces the outside wall of the wrong side of the house) with Jenny and also Roger Daltrey, who's wearing a tight white T-shirt and looking very fit. There are other people in the house, we're having some kind of get-together, and I'm helping with the dishes. Jenny's on my left, we've been talking, and Roger comes up behind me. He has a bag of foodstuffs to be put away - leftovers from something, and I take an interest in them as I take them out. There's some soup in a plastic container - he says I should try that, how about he fixes it up for me? (I haven't eaten - haven't been here long.) Oh, yes, that would be great! I remark how good he looks - he's put on some weight, yes, but he's fitter, more developed, and he looks taller - this surprises and amuses him. Jenny's never seen him before, so she doesn't know if he looks taller or not, she's at a loss there. We're having some trouble hearing each other, there's apparently some noise, we have to repeat things and shout, missing a lot of what's said. Roger asks me for something for the soup, I think he said fat, but I'm not sure so I ask him to repeat - he says fat again, and I don't know why, but okay - I ask Jenny if she's seen any and she says try one of those bags in the refrigerator - all the group food's packed up in there. I pull one out and look in, remarking on a couple of things in the top [one of which I've forgotten - it slipped down toward the bottom of the bag] . I say, What? well, what do you know? Look at this, little tiny chocolate-chip - no I mean chocolate - oh, like - chocolate-sandwich cookies! [They look like Oreos, actually] How neat! But no - they're not cookies, I guess - they're marked ""Tylenol"" and they're in a Tylenol bottle. How weird. Oh, well. [Whatever else is in the bag, I remark on it to Jenny, saying there must have been a LT event, look at all this stuff.] She says it's not hers, actually it belongs to _____, she has a date with him later and he's going to fix her a meal. Oho - so Jenny's seeing a new man. Hmm. Meanwhile there's been no fat turn up, and Roger's gone on cooking without it. He's produced a couple of fried eggs that he's somewhat dubious about (so that's what he wanted the fat for), but I think it's swell of him to be doing this for me."
"329"	"(7/27/91)"	"I'm in a large hotel with a group - mostly LT people - and the place is quite crowded, I think we're here unexpectedly too, so we're sort of camping out in a balcony - maybe even with sleeping bags. My bed is next to the balcony edge, and I'm looking out over it with a couple of other women (one of whom is Linda T., I think). The one behind me has something the other wants to see - I'm actually sitting on the ledge with my feet up on it - and the one beside me reaches very awkwardly across me for it, I'm afraid she's going to knock me off. Actually I wouldn't fall all the way down, I guess (this is higher than 1 floor, maybe) - there are other structures at different levels around - but I don't know. Below you can see a large open space, lots of people milling around (it's more like a mall), bright light - up here it's dim, we're getting ready to go to bed. Sandra McLean comes in, she sits near us, and somebody says we should do something, like have a game, and I remember I've got some Mah-Jongg tiles in my bag - I think they came with it, and I've just left them there. I get them out and have a look at them - none of us are particularly interested in that, so I'm going to put them back, when I discover a little pocket in the bag. It's a kind of duffel, colorful, and there's already a zipper pocket at the end of it, but now I see there's another, small pocket, on the top, close to the end, just the right size for little things. I'm quite pleased. About this time a boy comes in, one of our group who's been in an altercation with somebody downstairs. Whatever it was about, I don't know, but I do know this guy sometimes does shoot his mouth off a bit, and apparently he just said the wrong thing to this other guy, who's a bit of a bully, and he shoved him, or maybe even knocked him down, and now he's hurt - sort of banged up around the shoulders, he's carrying them funny and he looks so sad and hurt. I feel terribly sorry for him and want to comfort him, partly because he's so hurt and I know guys often hold that stuff in and it hurts worse when you do that; and partly because when holding on to that pain, you can hold on to your physical pain too, and I want him to have comfort for that. [At first I had him looking like Johnny Depp, and then later he seems to be Tim Matheson and I have this idea that Depp is the bully.] I'm a little shy because I do have a little bit of a crush on him, and I don't want him to think I'm taking advantage - also because I don't know him especially well and he might not want a hug from somebody not close to him. But I go and tell him how sorry I am and make a move to hug him, and he hugs me back. I'm very careful with his shoulders, so as not to hurt him, and I try to let my energy come through and help relax him. He cries a bit and lets his pain show*. (I'm still holding the Mah-Jongg tiles in my left hand.)"
"330"	"(7/27/91)"	"Next, I'm starting to set up a sort of doll camp (is it for kitties?) next to the house. I live in this brick suburban house with a lot of people - I think of them as family, so there should be a daddy somewhere, but all I know about right now is grown women. One of them, my friend (or sister?) is setting this up with me between the fence and the garage wall. She's pretty much finished hers, but I got delayed and am just starting. We've got these bamboo stakes and some cloth, to make a little pavilion (each) with, and some dolly-furniture. There's other junk piled up around here too. I start to set up my tent/pavilion-thing, copying hers, but don't do it very well. Even as I get it worked out, the light is starting to fade, it's late in the afternoon and I should be putting these things away for the night; I'll start again tomorrow. I'm considering, though, which of these things could be left out overnight - maybe the stakes - but no, a dog might dig them up and take them, or it might rain and they'd be sunk in the mud. So I pull them up. There's a little 3- or 4-shelf rack-thing on the wall, it's wood, maybe it would be ok to leave it and put things on it - maybe not. About this time, here comes a little parade from the back, there's a little fenced yard just off the house's corner, and Marilyn, Linda (or Phyllis?), and Bonnie are bringing some junk in a cart up to the front. Marilyn's pushing it (it's either a wheelbarrow or a grocery cart) and there's something big in the front like a piece of plywood, that blocks visibility. And the whole cart is really crowding the space, I'm afraid she's gonna run over our stuff. I tell her to look out, please be careful, but she's rather oblivious. Linda/Phyllis tells me don't worry, it'll be okay, she's always like this. A little beyond where my stuff is, there's a frame with glass in it (or a mirror) on top of something, and it's broken so that a long, pointed piece of glass is leaning out of it. I'm concerned about it, especially since it makes me think of that part in The Stand where a woman deliberately cuts her throat and sticks a piece of glass in her eye so her head and face would be mutilated. Of course, that was intentional, but this particular piece of glass is about eye level, and I don't want anybody to run into it. I think I can tape it up, but Marilyn's still coming and I don't have time, so I just hold it up, very carefully out of the way as they pass. Then I go back and find some tape - I thought I had that brown tape but all there is, is masking tape - and then I put some on the edges, meaning to cover them all up so I can handle it, then tape the whole piece flat in so it won't stick out. Bonnie tells me I'd better be nice to Nick - he's especially miffed because his ""place"" has been disturbed. [I don't know if that's something they did - I think he likes to sleep in the garage - or if this little play-camp for kitties is for him."
"331"	"(7/29/91)"	"Next, I'm in a public place - maybe a restaurant - and I'm near a window-counter thing where either you order, or you pay. I'm in line (the rest of my group - LT people again - are still elsewhere - at a table?) with some women I'm acquainted with, they're lawyers, all well-groomed, nice looking, nice suits. They know me from the library, or at least a couple of them do, and one is saying, ""She's really good, she really knows her stuff"" to the others, who nod and look interested. I feel as if they are older than me, mostly because of their professional status and income and grooming, but I know that we're more or less the same ages, I'm just aware that I'm not on that level with them - I wonder how they see me. Something is mentioned about a job they've been trying to fill - one of them even holds up a piece of paper with an example of what they need done, and I can see it's just putting things in order and shelving books. I think they don't know what my regular job is in the Business Office, they just know me as being in the library, and they don't know what else I can do or whether this would be paying enough. I say to particularly one of them, well, it's certainly something I could do, but there are other things we ought to talk about - I wouldn't say no...without seeing what else there might be going on with it and what I could do for you - how about if I come see you and we'll talk? So we fix that up, and just then Lori shows up next to me (there seems to be a kind of cafeteria line to my right), she's just arrived. I haven't seen her in a week or a few, maybe, but my word she looks awful! She's lost a lot of weight, her face looks drawn and pinched, and she's cut her hair short, which is certainly no help. I'm very concerned and ask her what on earth's happened. [There is no reply before I wake up.]"
"332"	"(7/28/91)"	"I'm sitting in on this high-school class. [I don't remember why I'm here, but it's sort of a matter of circumstances.] They're studying science, parts of the atom and chemistry. It's a room where the teacher is at the bottom and the seats go up like a theater, quite steep. The teacher (actually I think there's more than one) is asking questions and I can answer most of them, that's fun. Then they stop - I guess for a study break - and I go to the opposite side of the room and sit with this male teacher, who's talking to a few of the boys separately to find out if one of them is responsible for something. I'm just waiting for class to be over so we can get on with something. I live in a sort of community house with several other people. I'm trying to work out how this TV (or something) antenna works, trying to get a better picture (or reception?); I pull out the 2 ends till they're even, that's not much help, then the phone rings and a woman wants to know something that I have to go find out about. While I'm talking to her I realize that another fixture has an antenna, it's attached to the column here and pulls out sideways. I just give it a tug and find it's longer than it looks, I didn't think it had that much length to it. But I go off, and I think I know the answer to her question but I get distracted in the bathroom, talking to somebody else. Then she leaves and I'm dawdling. Princess Diana walks in, someone shouts from outside, ""Who is keeping this line on hold?"" and I have to go. I'm supposed to be in this one bedroom on the left side, center of the house, and I like it best, but there's been a mixup and someone is shuffling people around. This young man has been put in here with me and we've both got beds so we've spent one night in here, but now I'm overhearing the landlady saying she's going to put me somewhere else. That's not fair, I was here first."
"333"	"(7/30/91)"	"I'm with a couple of other people, one's a photographer (or even a film producer or director), dressed up in one of those sleeveless jacket things over a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up, etc. We are interviewing former superheroes for something commercial [maybe a movie, not sure] in a loft sort-of-thing, upstairs, lots of space, reminds me of where Images by Aki used to be on Greenville. The prospects are coming one by one, and this lady just now coming up the stairs is next. She's blonde, short hair, nice-looking - wearing a dress with a full skirt, a sort of marble-y black and gold print. It's nice on her, but we wanted to photograph everybody in costume. We say hello to her, say a couple of things or ask a few questions, the usual, and we can see she's very grave, almost sad. We ask her about the costume - she doesn't answer for a while, and we're very concerned. Her face does turn sad and dejected, hopeless. She makes a hopeless gesture and starts to pull down her left shoulder strap, as if to take off the dress. To me it seems this is about her wanting to get out of the superheroes business, but not being able to. For her it's awful, and she's breaking up. I go to her and tell her it's okay, you don't have to do this, and she starts to cry. I hold her - there's a chair here, I sit on it and let her lean back against me and I stroke her hair. She cries some more and gets through it. Eventually she goes off with someone, and the photographer-guy kneels by the chair, and says, ""You know, your gift is in your voice - that's where your power comes from, you have the power to heal in your voice."" [Or something very close to that.] I'm a little surprised, but it's nice of him to say that."
"334"	"(8/1/91)"	"I'm in my house, and there's a bird in here - it's absolutely beautiful, it's a fairly big bird and has peacock feathers, very beautifully designed. (It's not a peacock, it's a flying bird, the body is beige-ish, and the peacock feathers are in different places.) I don't know how it got in here, I suppose it flew in by accident when somebody had the door open. Well, I expect it wants out - I'll go hold the front door open and maybe it'll see. I don't want to startle it, it might just fly around the house and never get out - you know how these things can be. It does move closer to the door (I was a room away a minute ago), and I step very carefully, quietly past it. Now at the door, I see that somebody else is here. [This is no longer clear, but it's definitely one animal that lives here and one that doesn't - I could presume one of my cats, but I'm not sure. And the other is not a cat, for sure, but not necessarily any particular other animal - it has characteristics of a lamb, but I think it's a combination of animals. Basically it's small, cute, and innocent-looking.] I'm concerned that they'll get out if I just leave the door open for the bird - a pretty silly situation."
"335"	"(8/3/91)"	"I think I'm in England, on a sort of ""field"" trip with a group of friends - we're sort of camping out in a nearly-empty storefront that I think is being used as an antiques warehouse. We have sleeping bags and all, scattered around on the floor. There may be 8 or 10 of us, including Johanna. We're sort of lounging around, there's no particular plans, and some of us go out for a walk. There's a fair number of people about, it's a nice friendly place, and cute little shops up and down the street. A little further down there's a sort of square, with flowers and seats, where people sit. As we stroll along that way, I pass by a guy who doesn't look nice at all - scruffy, sinister, dirty - and he says something to me (he's also black) - I don't want to encourage him, so I just nod or something and go on. He gets up and follows. I walk a little faster, but he's still there. [He sticks with me for a bit, but I do some clever maneuver that loses him, which I've forgotten now.] So I carry on back to the storefront in a hurry. We're having a good time, sitting around joking. Somebody comes up with what's left of a bag of bagel chips and passes it around. Johanna and I leap on it, we're hungry. I get one, pass it, then grab it back and get another, Johanna does too. It's evening, the light is dimming. A man comes along to take us somewhere. He has a ""flivver"" - it's really quite neat, a black horse and buggy, the spidery kind with a folding top, and this one has a sort of high rumble seat. He (the man) talks to our leader, who gets us all organized and our luggage gathered, and we pile in. I get put in the rumble seat, and I'm really doubtful about this - it's really high, and bouncy, I can see right over the canvas top of the carriage and it's precarious up here. But they tell me I'll be fine (there's someone else up here too). We go off. It's a nice ride, off out of town through some lovely green woods and little hills. It's night now, all quiet and rich and exotic-seeming. We arrive at the man's house. It's a farm or an estate, I guess - big place. We stop at what I guess is a barn or carriage-house and get out. His daughter comes to greet us, she's maybe 14, long dark hair, pretty. Some of us go off to the house with her. While I'm still here looking at something, the man's son comes by the side of the building, leading a pony on a rope. The pony is being frisky, and the boy is getting pulled along now. There's a big mud patch right at the corner, and - whoops! pony slips and goes down, right over, legs up, and of course the boy gets pulled right down too, on his face. His dad laughs, so do we. I notice it's daylight, and I'm amazed. [There's a scene fragment about getting ready to go home, and I'm aware that in another dream I was talking about, and intending to practice, lucid dreaming.]"
"336"	"(8/4/91)"	"I'm in a (place like a movie theater) with friends, and I have to go to the bathroom - it's around a wall and down a corridor. There's 1 or 2 people in here to start with, and I find the catch on the door has to be just-so before it will hold. [Somehow the scene changes, and there are 2-3 other girls in here with me - the space is wider and the wall doesn't go all the way across - it's open on the right. Around the wall it's an office - Andrea H. is at a desk with someone else, and she's telling me she has an assignment for me when I get through. I duck back around the wall; now I'm wondering how I can pee with all these people around. [I do something, which results in a puddle of pee that I need to pick up and dump out, and I get my feet and legs splashed - it's not a whole lot, but I'm annoyed. Some even got on my skirt. I go over to Andrea - we walk outside while she tells me something (it's either about what I'm to do when I'm gone from here, or while she's gone somewhere). We stop by a short open bookcase with various things on it, including a shoe - it has no mate, and I pick it up out of idle curiosity. She says it was left by one of the branch managers. [I'm thinking a black one.] It's black fabric, high-heeled, and actually open down the front, with scalloped edges. It's big too, and I put it on for the fun of it, considering I've got on flats and this will make me quite off-balance. It sure is big - it's almost big enough that my foot would fall straight out of the opening on top. I find this very amusing - I expect Andrea to remark on it, but she doesn't, and so I call to a friend nearby and show her. (There are several people about, doing things.) Now I need to go, and I walk around to the front of the house where my car is, and I stop and say hello to the cats, especially Alleycat, who I haven't seen for a while - they're perched up on a very low roof or wall where the driveway stops. I get in my car [or somebody's anyway] and drive a little way down the street - it's a very nice street with tall green trees, a roof of leaves, sunlight showing through. [There's some reason I have to turn around - I pull into a driveway, back out, and go the other way. I have trouble adjusting the mirror, and I'm afraid I'm going to hit a man or his car with the outside mirror on mine - it's quite large. But it turns out okay."
"337"	"(8/5/91)"	"I'm in a school, we're doing a LT, it's the afternoon break. Most of the trainees are here, but most of the team is gone, and the trainers aren't here but a couple of guys in suits who belong to the school are. This is a regular classroom, with windows, and somebody's seen smoke. I look around and find a very odd thing outside a window: there's a desk, with a chair, everything as if it were in an office, right outside one window, behind a hedge, and on it is a can or something with smoke coming out, just pouring out in a funnel (as if it started from a little spot and was flowing fast). It may not be an actual fire yet, but it's unattended and looks dangerous to me. I go and tell the guys about it (the ones in the suits), concerned whether we should put out an alarm. They don't think it's such a big deal, and I say to the group, well then I'll go see what I should do about it - I should have time, it's a quarter till and the Training doesn't resume till 6 o'clock, right? Somebody says no, it's starting at 5.50. O dear. Well, then, I'll stay till then and I can do something. However, we've been hearing noises from another part of the school for a bit - and now I can see flames from a part of the building we can see through our windows, and people are shouting ""Fire!"" at a distance. We'd better do something."
"338"	"(8/5/91)"	"I'm at Peggy and James' house (at least it's supposed to be, but doesn't look like the real one). I've just stopped in here around noon, lunch-hour, to visit for a while but nobody's here. (It's a sort of homey place, white, black trim, probably 30's or 40's, modest, a front porch with a corner and 2 doors.) I go to check the mail - there's a long mailbox [like their real one only longer] , and I fumble somewhat getting the mail out - I pull it away from the wall. It's been stuck up there with double-sided tape, which I've twisted somewhat and I'm afraid I don't get it back on very well, but it looks ok, sort of. While I'm here on the porch I see that there are 4 people - kids, looking a little hoodlum-ish (at least one's got a black leather jacket on), one's a girl with long blonde hair, one guy has black ""greaser""-style hair, etc. - hanging around near the yard, on bicycles. It's all open here, no fences, and the house faces a corner of a wide business street - plenty of visibility, but not many people about. They're looking at the house, and now I see they have guns, actually pointed this way. I am very disturbed, but I think the thing to do is casually go to the car and lock myself in. I think I'll be safer there. (It's my mom's car, I think, and the house has also become hers now.) I get into the back seat and start locking the doors, but they're too fast for me - one jumps into the front passenger seat and leans over, pointing his gun at me, grinning. I freeze up. One or 2 have gone into the house too, and I'm suddenly horrified I've left it open - somebody holds up a bundle of money that was somewhere, I'm mortified that I've let them steal from my own mother. They all get in the car and one says we're going on a little trip, you just sit back and take it easy (or something like that). All very standard cop-show hoodlum stuff. [Next scene:] We're in a police station - all of them are here, and a policeman (detective? plain clothes, I think) and my mother are here. They're talking, and from what I can gather they meant to give themselves up. Maybe all along, I don't understand if this whole thing was some sort of ruse or not. I'm still terrified, pulled in on myself, won't say anything, in shock. I look from one to the other and don't quite believe what I hear. I want to cry but I can't. My mom says something. I get up and go out of the room (did somebody suggest it?), through a bit of corridor to a waiting room where there's a couch, chair, end table, lamp, etc. Finally I break down and sob hysterically, falling to my knees and huddling over the chair. I think somebody comes to comfort me, I think it's my mom."
"339"	"(8/30/91)"	"I'm at a place that resembles the yoga studio. This is a house, fairly big, and long - with various doors down the side. I'm with some other people and Fred, who's got to feed the pets for the owners of the house, they're on vacation, and he's gone on in. It's rather dark, like a very dark day, or dusk, but that's normal. The house may be old or not, but it's kind of clumsy-looking, not exactly ramshackle but tired, neglected, something like that, and that's normal too. Some men show up looking for the residents, or at least the wife, and we tell them they're not there. They ask [something we can't answer; either where they've gone or can they - the men - come into the house for some reason] and we (or at least I) say we can ask Fred about it, he's the only one who knows anything. So we go down to the door where the kitchen is. I thought it was one in particular and then realized it was the next one instead, so I open that one and here's Fred, behind the refrigerator door, which opens across the space of the outside door. It's also up a step, so all I see of Fred is the top of his head. I start to ask him our question, but he waves me away with his arm - I start again, ""But..."", and he does it again, very vehemently, so I just shrug and say okay, and close the door. I assume that maybe the dogs are very touchy and might get vicious if there's some interruption, or something's going on in there that he shouldn't be distracted from. The door is metal, and rather flimsy - it doesn't close very well and I fiddle with it for a bit. [Next scene: this is directly connected, but I'm pretty sure doesn't happen in the same place.] There's this girl who's staying in this apartment that's part of high-rise combination office/residential/shopping conglomeration. She's young, blonde, short hair, nice-looking - I don't know if she lives here or is staying with a friend, but she's alone for now. She goes down the hall to this copy office, a kind of self-serve place that also has files in it, and a couple of secretarial types who work at desks. Our girl is looking for a file in some sort of drawer - the files are left of the door, and there's a table in the center of this end of the room, so to look in the lower files you're rather crowded between it and the table. One of the ""secretaries"" comes over to the same area and in order to get where she wants, she has to reach around the girl. This is pretty close in, and the girl is very uncomfortable. She gets up as soon as she can. Back in the apartment, some men come in. They're all wearing suits and seem a bit on the tough side, and apparently this is some sort of a kidnapping. The leader forces the girl to tie up the other guys (they're part of the gang, but still this the plan) and then he ties her up, and then himself. Now, you can't actually tie yourself up too well of course, and this is rather perfunctory, but then he can still do the next thing which is to set the place on fire. Actually there is a fire, but the whole place doesn't burn up - there's a lot of smoke and it's very murky but the fire goes out. It appears this is intentional, it's something akin to a suicide pact, but more into S & M. Later [presumably the previous episode is past] she's come back to the copy room again, but this time she's nervous, looking very uptight about something. She stands for a bit on the other side of the table as if she were waiting for something. Then she goes to the file again, and the same thing happens - the secretary comes over and practically has her arms around our girl to get at some files. This time she freaks out, though, and fights back, struggling, kicking, screaming. The secretary tries to subdue her, which makes it worse, and they knock around some more, and then the girl gets away. She runs down the hall, which is where I see her. I start to chase her - there's a reason for this, I'm some sort of law enforcement - and she gets away down the turns. She's frantic - pretty mussed, and her knees are all scratched up, pantyhose (or whatever she's wearing) all torn, she's bleeding a bit, so she's quite noticeable. We've come out into this very large mall, multilevel, lots of people about, bright lights. She runs to an escalator in the middle, and takes off down it. We (someone is with me) follow, and I hesitate for a second at the top, seeing that there's not many people up here but it's crowded at the bottom - the escalator is very wide - and I'm afraid I'm not sure-footed enough to run down this thing. But, I think, I've got on good running shoes and I can do this. So off we go, at top speed, taking 2 or 3 steps at a time, and down toward the bottom. I realize that it's not as crowded as it had looked from the top, there's enough room. We dash on across the floor after her, to a door that leads to the underground parking garage. It's a garage, all right, there's cars here, but boy is it grungy. We're up a bit, you go down a half-flight of concrete steps to the parking floor. Everything here is covered with grime, and to our left a car is being picked up by a filthy tow truck - it looks like they've been working on it, and have had to give up, so they're towing it. The mechanics are all black, dressed in sweaty, greasy dark-blue short-sleeved mechanic shirts and pants. All their stuff has pounds of that thick black grease mixed with dirt on it that you could scrape off like mud. (This is all normal too - in this world, there are thousands of mechanics, they're like the central figures in society, rather the way doctors, lawyers, or policemen or politicians are here - one defers to them, and there are always mechanics working on broken-down cars everywhere you go.) We dash down the stairs, following the girl around the center rows of cars, to the left, then right again to the back wall, where there's a concrete walk up some steps, with a rail, and it turns around to more steps descending into a pit. There's a door down there, and she's making for that - I gather that this is the passage to the ""gang's"" secret hideout, how they've been getting to places they break into. The girl pauses on the steps, looks up at us still on the walkway, and she's wilder than ever. She's got dark circles around her eyes like a 30's Dracula movie, and a maniacal grin. She flings some taunt at us, like, ""We'll be back - we'll get you"" or ""You'll get yours, you'll see"", something like that."
"340"	"(9/3/91)"	"I'm in the diner across from the library eating a ""Veggie-Burger"" with some other people. They all get finished and go, but there's one woman still here, and she says, ""How can you eat that? Whenever I eat any kind of meat I just get sick"", and I'm really startled. I thought this was a veggie/soy patty of some sort, and I scrape the melted cheese off (rather a lot, a white cheese with bits of peppers and other veg in it) and examine the patty closely - by George it looks like hamburger - thin, but hamburger - and I pull it apart with my fingers to see if it feels like meat. It does. I take it up to the counter. The woman there isn't the regular person but I show her and complain, ""How can you do this? This is hamburger! What a rotten thing to do!"" She's somewhat taken aback but doesn't say anything. In the back of my mind I've been thinking they must have thought they could call it ""Veggie-Burger"" if they just put vegetable things on top."
"341"	"(9/3/91)"	"I'm with a bunch of people somewhere out of the country, maybe England, I figure we're doing a LT, and we're staying in this place that's old and large, with lots of rooms. We've sort of bunked where we could, girls here, boys there, and most of our luggage (or at least where my clothes are) is in this big long room rather like an attic, with various wood roof supports, trunks, hanging-racks, old furniture, the odd cobweb, dust. My friend and I are going back here to collect our stuff so we can pack, it's time to go home, and I'm filled with thoughts about travelling, planes and such. As I'm picking things up I realize that they're pretty scattered around, as if in our coming and going we'd been pretty casual, hanging things here and there, setting things down in different places, and I'll have to collect them. But somehow the racks and things look emptier than I expected, and now others of us are coming in, bustling around. They're not packing up right now, just my girlfriend and I, and frankly they're in the way, particularly the guys. I'm moving from place to place looking and I have to keep dodging people. Now I come to the conclusion the stuff is just not here. How can that be? I'm quite confused."
"342"	"(9/12/91)"	"I'm in England, visiting I think - or maybe I'm supposed to get married. I've been visiting with some people and a man came - he's somebody we knew and like, but he's rather shy and retiring. Lives in the country, and I'm supposed to go visit him. He has to leave right away, and I'll follow on my motor scooter shortly. He tells me where he lives and how to get there - when I get to the town he'll meet me. He leaves, and I finish up, say goodbye to my friends, and putter off. Rouse is with me, and it's quite a challenge to hold on to her and drive. We leave the city and drive through suburbs, buildings getting smaller and farther apart, more and more green trees and grass. It's very pretty here - the road becomes a lane, winding through tall trees, little hills. It gets to be harder to hold Rouse - she's getting restless. part of me is observing, and wonders if I don't have any more luggage than this (there's a small bag somewhere on the scooter). I think of ways I could be carrying more, like a knapsack or a carrier. I begin to be concerned about how to get where I'm going. I think I stay on this road until I come to the town, but he mentioned 3 towns and I seem to have forgotten which one is the right one. I've been relying on my memory - nothing written down - and that's probably a mistake, now I'm having doubts. We keep on until we come to a place that has some people milling around - some event is going on - and I figure I can go and ask for some help. It turns out to be a dog show, or trials, and these people are rather upper-class, with expensive outdoors-y clothes, a woman wearing jodhpurs, all that. Having dogs around is also pretty tricky with Rouse here. (Part of me wonders why I don't have a carrier for her, and also, how can she be with me instead of in quarantine? - actually that's a little later, after I've left again.) The woman wants to help out but isn't really sure how, since she doesn't know the man I'm going to see and I don't have much information. The men (2 or 3 of them) aren't interested, and wander off. My brother (who's younger than me here) is in a side room of the house, a sort of den/workroom, he's sitting on a couch and a couple of other guys are sitting nearby, one perched on a desk - he's older than my brother, sort of a mentor, and they're having a sort of heart-to-heart talk, very emotional for my brother, he's working through something. I come in and sit down next to him, just becoming aware of what's going on. I feel an empathy for him - I really am fond of him, though we're not usually affectionate - and put my hand up to pat his neck. I rub my hand on the back of his head - he's got a buzz cut, it's real short - and lean over close to him. He puts his arm around me and we hug. I'm pleased to be able to offer him support. I'm supposed to be getting married - I've got on a wedding dress and there are a number of people about, all dressed nice. We're outdoors, at a place where you travel from - either a marina or an airport. There's a plane or boat here, that I'm going to go away on, and I'm up on its top or hull, and it's in sunlight. Most of the others are in shade under the canopy/roof. I'm climbing across the hull - there are clusters of ribbons with streamers decorating the top, in a row, sort of, and I'm collecting some of them. There are big bows, firmly attached, I'm leaving those, they're meant to stay, but I'm picking up smaller ones, that are just stuck down with Scotch tape."
"343"	"(9/14/91)"	"I wake up and go through the bedroom door into the living room - I realize that someone has broken in and stolen everything. Even the bookcase is gone, the one on the right. I'm stunned - I can't believe it's happened, even while I was here and didn't hear anything at all, I'm scared and feel violated, I've been so stupid to think I was safe, and it's happened again. Gradually I realize I'm still in bed - I don't think I could have gone from there to here and not remembered it, I must be dreaming the robbery. That's quite a relief. I feel a whole lot better. I wish I wouldn't dream about break-ins so often. I get up and go into the living room again, just like I did before, and I see that the bookcase is still there just like it should be [it's not like my real one, it's plain wood with closed sides] - except it's been pulled away from the wall somewhat - it's at an angle. That's weird. I look around and see that everything's here, but I realize the only way for the bookcase to have been moved is for somebody to have moved it. It wasn't me, so that means somebody's been in here. Somebody must have broken in after all - maybe something's been taken and I haven't noticed yet. Oh dear. Now I'm getting nervous."
"344"	"(10/20/91)"	"I'm with a bunch of girls at a house, it's something like a birthday party, we're all talking and laughing. I go outside and over to the landing where I'm to get on a boat with a man (my boss? father? boyfriend?) and a couple of other people, but I've been delayed and they're already pushing off. They're too far off for me to jump on and can't come back now, but I figure I can just step over to the dinghy and get on from that. He and they are waving and shouting to be careful, I'll tip it over, but I think I can do it. It's harder though, because I'm wearing high heels (black pumps). I do manage to get into the thing, just on the side, making it lean over so the far side is in the air, but I wait and it stabilizes. Then I take another step to the center, but that's too much and it goes right over. Just in time I jump back onto the edge of the landing."
"345"	"(10/26/91)"	"I'm downtown, waiting for a bus, and I see my neighbors - they're Mexicans, actually a large family, here's the mother and a couple of daughters. We chat, and some others in the family come along, husband I guess, and other sons & daughters. They were just in the vicinity and are going to give the wife et al a lift home. I seem to be excluded, which I think is pretty tacky. They walk along to where the car is, and after a hesitation I tag along, trying to chat with the younger son, who's somewhat retarded and who I have previously had a sort of amiable relationship with. He's dressed up in a suit, rather unusual, and he's not interested in talking to me - in fact, we stop for a bit and as we're facing each other I can see he's looking at me with real hostility. Very strange. I'm disconcerted and figure I better just go on off my merry way. Elsewhere on the street, further up, I'm walking along with my purse firmly clamped under my arm. (It has a shoulder strap, too, but I also have it pinned like a clutch bag for safety. It's taupe, a soft bag, like that one I gave Michelle but smaller.) I feel a tug on it, and turn around to see what's going on. A sleazy-looking little man in an ill-fitting suit has hold of it - he thought he could just snatch it, apparently, and since I have it firmly he didn't get it. He looks at me menacingly, as if I'd better let go of the thing or I'd be sorry, and I pull back on it again, very indignant. Neither of us makes a sound. I'm not anxious to cause a scene if he'll just let go, maybe he'll think twice about purse-snatching again. He apparently just wants me to be intimidated into letting him have it because he could hurt me - indeed, he starts to reach into his jacket for something, making an expression that's supposed to be warning me - I guess he's got a gun or a knife, but I'm not going for it, not yet anyway. There's lots of people around, he could hardly get away with it - though at the same time I realize he probably could, the way things are today. I'm worried about that sort of thing. Still, I yank on my purse before he can reach whatever it is, and get it free. I hustle on ahead. It goes through my mind that I ought to hold my purse further forward to make it harder for somebody to grab from behind, then I picture myself always carrying my purse (and whatever) clutched tightly to my chest like I'm paranoid, then I picture everybody, all the people going up and down the street, carrying their stuff like that, all holding on for dear life. Ludicrous, really. Oh well. I stop to tell a policeman, who's standing a bit further up the street, what happened, but he's not interested. I go on to this hotel-apartment house that I'm (staying?) in. [It looks like a lot of places I've seen in England - long hallways, old-looking but solid, very well kept, plain, dark wood stair-rails, etc.) This man runs it [he has a bit of Jerry Haynes and Walter Pidgeon in him] and we're trying to hide Elvis Presley. I'm a sort of companion, although there are some others involved in this effort, and we've come to this man as a contact who will help hide Elvis and get him away. The man is rather on the suspicious side himself, though - rather odd, a dapper little guy with a silly little mustache, cryptic, secretive. I'm not comfortable with him. I meet them in ""our"" room, and put my things down, coat over the back of the couch, etc., and we go down the hall a few yards, up a few steps and around a corner to another room. The man leaves, we're to wait. I think about my purse again after a few minutes, realizing it's just sitting on the back of the couch, very noticeable, and we didn't shut the door - there's nobody about, the place might be deserted except for us, but I'm worried. I know I shouldn't leave Elvis alone, but I get antsy, and after a few more minutes I decide it'll be okay to just dash back to the room and fix it. I look all down the hall - there's nobody to be seen, no sounds - and I go. My purse is there, but as I pick it up it seems to feel different, lighter, like something's missing. I check briefly, but it seems okay - checkbook's there, that would be the biggest thing. Don't know, maybe it's lighter because I had something in it earlier that usually isn't, oh well. I take it back with me to the other room. Elvis isn't there. Uh-oh. I look all over for him - this is a kind of suite, it has a kitchen and living area - an efficiency apartment? No Elvis. The man comes back, some other people too, one of whom is a girlfriend of mine. We discuss the matter, and divide up. Somebody goes out, the man gets on the phone. It's also getting on for dinnertime, and we're cooking something. I figure we want some cinnamon for this dish we've got going, and I think of a plant that's in the back of the room near the window. It has little leaves on it that [either are cinnamon, or taste like it] , and I start to pick some off. I look out the window casually, and am surprised to see a dog lying on the grass. What's in back of this (house) is mostly trees, a little bit of yard, and a little railroad track. It's dark, and what light there is, is coming from here through the window. This dog looks funny, and I suddenly see blood on its head and I realize it's been hit (presumably by a train). It looks dead. Yuck. But as I watch, it moves - it was just hurt. It lifts its head up and shifts around, and I now realize it's not even a dog - I guess - maybe it is, but it's beginning to look like an elephant. That's very weird. I'm getting very confused, watching it. I realize that if it's an elephant, it must be a baby, if I mistook it for a dog. Geez. I suppose I'd better tell somebody about this, but I'm not sure I'm not hallucinating either. Wow. I go back into the room and mean to give the leaves to my friend for the pot, but before I do she shows me she found some old cinnamon somewhere and she's all ready to use that. I don't mention my leaves, though I feel rather shot down - it's amazing how ""little"" I feel, as if I were a little kid who'd been slighted by her parents. So I just poo-poo myself and carry on. We go into the dining room [this place has gotten bigger, you see] and we're talking. There's a dining table lengthwise in the room, a window at the end with filmy drapes, and just the daylight through them, so the room's in shadow. There's a chair or two away from the table, standing between us, having just come in the door, and the space next to the table. On the other side (in that space) is a very large papier-mache black bird. I don't know what it's for - though maybe it's something to do with an upcoming party the man's having - but I look at it briefly, it's rather neat. It moves, and at first I'm surprised but realize it's probably just tipped over, vibrated off balance. But then it moves again, and I'm sure it's done it on purpose. I say, ""Stop that"" as if it's alive, thinking how silly I sound, and remark to my girlfriend that I'm sure I saw it move. I go around the chair to get in front of it, as it's moved toward the table, and I squat down facing it. When I do, I realize it's actually a cat, not a bird; how could I have mistaken it for a bird? Strange. And it's very cunning, this thing. It doesn't quite look like papier-mache any more, it's got fur - and I notice two extra eyes looking at me, hidden in the black fur above the fake eyes. I stare for a minute, then realize what I'm seeing - by George, it's Elvis! This is a disguise! I tell my girlfriend to come see, and at first she doesn't either - this is really good! I explain to her what this is, and first she says, oh, pshaw, something like that. But then she sees, too, and is also dumbfounded. There are two blue eyes peeping through that fur! I don't know how he got in this outfit that fast, but it sure is a good way to hide. I suspect that the man has something to do with this, but I don't know."
"346"	"(11/4/91)"	"I live with my family - we're not the classiest bunch, generally blue-collar, dark curly hair, Dad eats dinner in a T-shirt, etc. I'm in my room doing something, dinner's ready and Mom calls me but I don't care. There's a shower curtain across a bathtub on one side of the room, and there's something large that protrudes from it - maybe something I made, I think I'm an artist - but it's clumsy and not particularly good, ignorable. I'm working at a desk or table on the far side of the room, and my dad yells at me to get up and come to dinner anyway. I bitch and moan but I get up and see that the ""thing"" has been changed. Now it looks like a big penis, and not a nice clean pink one either. I'm disgusted and outraged. It has to have been my brother that did this. I'm gonna get him for it too. I stomp out to the table and announce that ""somebody"" has been screwing around in my room, telling my parents ""You go look at it - just look at what he's done"" - meaning my brother, of course, glaring at him. He laughs and I get madder. I go over and grab him, lifting him up and sinking my teeth into his arm, and I fling him back and forth as hard as I can. I'm fed up with this crap, I'm leaving. I'm gonna walk right out of here and never come back. I pick up my black leather jacket and stalk out."
"347"	"(11/5/91)"	"James has got some records and a toy piano for a woman who's coming to visit - an old friend or co-worker. He's very anxious that it should be a surprise, but she shows up (she's tall, good-looking and sophisticated) suddenly and the stuff is out in the open. I spring into action, grab the piano and duck down the hall to the ""girls'"" room, think about sticking it in the bathtub behind the curtain but put it in the closet. I run into Connie and (?) and try to get them to grab the other stuff but they don't in time, so I go get the records, hoping my dashing around isn't too obvious. She doesn't say anything about it, anyway. Later, I'm on my way to work downtown (I think I'm in a car right now) and I'm going to turn right toward downtown on a street in near Deep Ellum. There's a car in the right lane that I would be pulling in front of to make the turn, but I can see the potholes in that part of the block are very bad, so I stay in the middle lane to clear them before I pull over and turn. I hope the other driver doesn't think nasty things about me. I have to make a stop before I get to work - a police station where I'm dropping in on a detective who's working on a case (embezzlement or something like that) involving a woman who looks like me. He was trying to pin it on me at first, but he knows better now, although he wishes he could just get it solved even if it turns out that it was me. We have a pretty casual relationship, and I'm just checking in with him to see how he's coming along, if he needs me for anything. I see him at a desk in a sort of dark anteroom - there are a number of other inquiring, waiting-in-line types around, but I chat with him while he's doing paperwork. He says they've located her but she eluded them - something about being under something at the bottom of a boat. I wave bye-bye when we're done, he always tells me they may be calling me again, and I go on to work. I'm on a kind of tricycle (or a funny bicycle) - it's black, and I have some trouble getting up a good speed on it. I try standing up and pumping the pedals but it's hard to keep my feet on them. I wish I'd brought my regular bike. I don't want to get there after dark - it's late afternoon now, I'm going into the sunset."
"348"	"(11/20/91)"	"I've just come home - we live in this shabby house on a big street, on the corner and there's nothing on the right side of it (as you're facing the house) but a busy street, some empty lots, and maybe a shopping center or a main drag. I've never actually stayed here - we've moved in just recently and I've been away for some reason. They've given me this front room that has a big window on the side and a smaller one on the front, and the only curtains are tired-looking white sheers. The overhead light's very bright, and I find when I start to change clothes that I can't do it practically anywhere in the room - with the sheers you can see the whole room, and there's plenty of traffic outside - I'm really self-conscious. I've already pulled off my top and I'm holding it against me, and don't know what else to do. I really resent this - those slobs of parents of mine shouldn't have done this to me, they just don't care. (My parents are Bonnie and a slovenly, hairy guy in an undershirt.) I try to think of something I can do but can't think of anything. There are cats here, Tree in particular but also others I don't know well and haven't been here long. One's just died suddenly, it was quite a surprise. Now another one is playing around, sort of jumping up on its hind legs in front of Tree, and gets hit in the head by the ceiling fan. Poor thing - I'm sorry, but I'm really bamboozled now. This is too weird. Later, as I'm looking for something to put over the windows (I think) I'm poking outside and start to take a box, but I look in it first, quickly realizing that's the box we put the dead cat in; I just glance in briefly and move away."
"349"	"(11/24/91)"	"Making drinks for Ted's group at Oak Lawn Library while there's an adult librarians' meeting going on. I have no great aptitude for it but I do all right. After a great deal of setting up and getting organized, I get a round of drinks off and go elsewhere for a while. OL never looked like this - downtown, office-building front, big conference room, outdoor swimming pool, retail store (J'Ann Alvarado's running it today). I go outside - it's a pretty sleazy end of town, and as I turn left and walk a bit I see across the street a guy is holding another guy up off the ground and threatening him. I keep my eyes averted, studiously, but also keep a lookout as I walk. Shortly I decide this isn't what I want to do and turn back. There's another couple of black guys on the street now, and I aim to avoid them. I have to walk right into the street to do this, pretending I meant to do this. They keep maneuvering as though they're going to stand in my way but I get around them and back into the library. It's occurred to me that they might be wanting second drinks, and I've just walked off - after all, I am supposed to be the bartender. But I check in and nobody's called for anything - as a matter of fact the drink-stand has been mostly cleared off, the extra bottles are gone. There's a catering or custodial staff cleaning up their meal, and I hadn't meant for them to do mine as well, but as long as they're doing it, how nice! I mean to ask somebody a question, to ask if Ted's left or how I can find out if I'm done here, but the speaker's still going on at the adult librarians' meeting, and Barbara from the parking booth is in here sitting down - she's not feeling well again, looks awful. I chat for a bit, and actually my back has begun to hurt and is getting worse - lots worse. I complain of it and somebody sympathizes, asks what happened, I say I got it from sitting on my little squashy couch. One of the librarians I know, sitting on the back row, says Daniel here should give me a talk on how to take care of your back. I say I've heard it, thank you, plenty of it, I couldn't stand any more. I'm squatting right now to relieve it, and get up saying I'm gonna go do my back exercises. I'm due at my own branch after this (which is an overtime gig) and I've got to do something about this. Later, I'm retyping the draft of something I'm writing for work - I've made some revisions (with input from Ted) and I'm anxious to get it finished. I type for a while, and get up to do something. Linda takes over, and I realize she doesn't know about an insertion/revision I've made between where I left off and a separate section. I go back and check what she's done and I was right, she just went on typing even though I'd left off with a comma, she didn't even notice. I point out to her that I want this revision in here, she says o dear, I'm sorry. I take over again. Later I take a phone call when I get home - it's dusk. It's a phone company trying to sell me phone service. I tell her I'm satisfied with what I've got, only person here, there are no teenagers here, no, no, no, thank you."
"350"	"(11/26/91)"	"The next-door back yard has huge exotic lettuces growing in a garden - all they have to do is take off a leaf or a part of one to have salad material for a week, and the whole plant's beautiful. I think I'll plant those next year, I'll get her to help me. I'm trying on sweaters in the store where Abby works, but (either there's no dressing room or I don't want to use it - I seem to be in a hurry). She's not thrilled with the idea and we have to keep a lookout for her bosses. I get stuck trying to pull my blouse off over my head and have to unbutton it, which is not fun because the buttonholes are tight. I'm also trying to change or pull off sweaters on the front lawn where you cross over to the next yard, though it's not flat here, there's rocks or an upgrade and bushes, so we're somewhat hidden - I'm talking about how even though I like to wear sweaters in the winter (Abby asked me why I was wanting all these), I certainly know to layer so I can pull some off when I'm too hot. There's a TV family here, getting ready to go somewhere, all wearing coats on the front sidewalk. I notice the stripe trim on the teenage daughter's coat, and think, ""You know, they must give her that same coat from wardrobe for consistency."""
"351"	"(11/28/91)"	"I'm in a hotel sitting on a couch, waiting to meet someone. It's a young woman who wants me (and someone else - a friend, I think) to house-sit for her for a few days. She and a companion come along, we shake hands and trade polite greetings, discuss arrangements, and go on to the house. It's a big place, she's/they've got a lot of money, but it's old, the house is full of antiques and frankly is stuffed full of eccentric things and is somewhat messy. Going on through to her bedroom, we find a similar jumble (by the way, the ceilings are very high), and there are 3 very large framed ""things"" on the wall. They're not pictures, but more like fabric, light colored things. My friend and I figure they need to be moved - they're liable to fall down anyway. We actually start to lift one off the wall and the woman says [something that indicates we should be leaving them alone, so we quickly put it back] ."
"352"	"(12/3/91)"	"I'm at an apartment house, I seem to be moving into a new apartment on the left side of the building upstairs, with Rouse, and a couple of people are helping me out. One of them, a young woman in pants, is going to sit with her for a while downstairs, and I tell her to be very careful, hold on to her tight outside. We go down and around the corner (someone else - another woman - is with us) to a place at the back of the building that's an entrance to [I guess] another apartment. It's a sort of low bubble-thing in a pool with little low bushes and plants around it. It's locked, and the girl with Rouse can't open it. I have keys that the [person whose apartment it is?] gave me, 2 keys on a ring, and I step over to open the ""door"", but fumble with them and drop them through the bush into the pool. Now somebody's going to have to fish for them... Back upstairs, I'm just getting started with what I'm doing when there's a commotion outside, someone's calling for Rouse, and I know she's got loose after all. Oh, hell - I told her to be careful. I go to the door and open it, and there's Mousie, she dashes right in. Wow. Well, okay, that's great. I step out and shut the door, leaning over the open railing to call downstairs that Rouse is in, and behind me I hear someone say, oh, good, that's a relief, etc. I turn and see a black couple - he's wearing a military uniform - and it seems they've been pressed into service to find Rouse. Shortly other people line up behind them until the stairs are crowded and I can't get down. Next: I'm in a theater in the balcony, just getting to my seat, it looks a lot like the Majestic used to. The Christmas Revels is about to start. There's a woman here, nice-looking, well-groomed, she's a kind of usher but more. A woman onstage sings a song, a really nice bouncy song - she has long blonde hair, wears a conservative ladylike knee-length dress - and after she sings some verses, and we're singing the chorus, she invites the audience to sing verses they know. (I didn't hear her do this, but various people start to sing, including a couple from our section of the balcony.) I think this is why the woman/usher is here, to be a kind of secondary ringmaster and encourage us to join in. A lady across from me offers a comment, she turns out to be English, and I wonder if there are a lot of English people here. I'm on the aisle, and I've set my purse down on the floor next to me. A couple of black women come down close to me - apparently they're looking for their seats, but rather than go any further they sit down on the aisle steps, close to my purse, which I'm not comfortable with. The usher-lady comes over to tell them they can't sit there, they have to go to their seats. [By the way, I'm very excited and thrilled to be here, fairly buzzing inside.]"
"353"	"(12/5/91)"	"I'm in my apartment [similar to this one] - there's a new guy moving in next door, he seems to be rather well off and sophisticated. Dapper-looking; I've been watching him through the window. I'm moving around, doing various chores, and I'm at the right front window, which has blinds on it, but they're partly open, so I can see part of the deck. As I take a look through, I see a man's face looking back at me. I'm shocked, terrified. When I find my voice, I shout, ""Go away!"" at him, and it comes out strangled. I shout it again, several times. In the back of my mind I'm observing that he doesn't look dangerous - he may have been just crashing out there and not planning to do anything harmful. [I'm not sure what time it is - it's either early morning or twilight, the light's like that.] But still I'm completely thrown, grasping for control, trying to shout loud but can't do it. I yell I'm gonna call 911, and even get the phone, holding it up where he can see. He looks concerned - like this is a disturbing wrinkle. He gets up and moves out of sight. I've punched the numbers, and I hear a voice, but I realize I'm hearing a recording. At the same time I'm moving over toward the door and I see it's unlocked, which is horrifying - how on earth did that happen? The door opens and he comes in. I'm still shouting as loud as I can, which sounds weak and tight and unsatisfying to my ears. I'm still hearing nothing on the phone. He moves toward me and I hit him with something I've picked up. I hit him again and again, he was surprised, and now he's got his arms out defending himself. I put the one thing down and hit him with the phone too. He sits on the floor and slumps over - I think he's unconscious. I go to the window on the side, hoping to call for the man next door. He's right there next to his car [which seems to be upstairs, right next to the window] , he's maybe polishing something. He's dressed in a tan suit with a tie - just middleaged, intelligent face, wavy hair. He listens calmly with interest while I choke out my call for help, and he comes around. I'm still near complete hysteria. And still in the back of my mind I'm aware this guy may not have meant any harm - the only hostile thing he's done is come through the door uninvited. But I'm just not able to get back under control. The man comes, and somehow Jenny's there, too (and another woman friend, who's doing something to help but I'm not paying any attention) - maybe he called her, I don't know. I must have said something to her about being sorry I couldn't shout louder, choking up, I feel so helpless, but she says, ""That was really pretty good... I bet you shouted half your moons out that time"" (or words to that effect). She's referring to astrological moons, the implication being that I've stored/pent up a lot of emotional energy in my moons that needed to be discharged, and this has given me a chance to release some of it. I just barely understand her. I figure I'll ask her to talk about it more later when things are back to normal."
"354"	"(12/8/91)"	"I'm going back to where I'm staying, along a freeway that's got businesses built up right next to it all the way down. There's no traffic. Nobody's around at all. I was driving, but now I'm walking along a sort of mall that follows the road, on the left side, and I'm stopping in a kind of delicatessen or bakery. The proprietor is a heavyset, swarthy man with a mustache, very friendly, we've been talking a bit and I'm eating a cookie. I'm in England, actually [or somewhere] and it's my last day. I'm on my way back to the house I'm staying in, having visited with some other people I know. Suddenly I feel terribly guilty when I realize I've spent hardly any time with them (the people I'm staying with), I've been off doing other things and we haven't even gotten to know each other. They must think I'm a terrible mooch. I start to leave. I've noticed a brown paper bag on the counter with a bit of grease stain on it - I thought a previous customer must have left it, and now that I'm leaving the man stops me to take it, he thinks it's mine. I tell him it isn't, etc., and he says take it anyway, your bonus, I'd only have to throw it out. I take it and set it on the counter to look in it, saying, maybe so, but it looks like there's a 6-pack of beer here, and I don't drink beer. But I pull the top things out and it's actually (what's left of) a 6-pack of Dr Pepper (little bottles). Then another couple cans of soft drink, and leftovers of something else, some food. Big deal. I don't know, I don't want it either. I'm arriving at a place next to where my group meeting will be - a very strange place, various levels of concrete, but a business, a number of people congregating, a young people's hangout. I park my car on the far side of a spot where you can maybe get 3 cars in, but there may not be room for Jenny's car, she's coming in right after me. I check my wheels and they're right on the edge. The other car is too far over, though. I consider moving mine so that the wheels are right over these brackets along the edge, but decide I can't do it by driving. Maybe I can push it another inch though, and even though the other car is a big heavy clunker, maybe we can all shove it against the wall and Jenny can get in... Upstairs, I meet up with some girls I know, some of whom are in our group, we're chatting. A couple of them are in their underwear. One asks me if she can use my dress for a while, and at first I say yes, and start unbuttoning it. It's a light-blue sort of flimsy cotton dress with a white collar and cuffs, and when I get it unbuttoned (I've moved away from the balcony rail to the back of the hallway, aiming for the ladies' room) I ask her, don't you have something I can put on while you have my dress? And how long will you be? I've got a group meeting in a few minutes. She acts as though I'm being selfish but doesn't give any direct answers, and I'm feeling very exposed. I don't want to stand around in my underwear - even though they are, I'm fatter than them and will be embarrassed. A group of guys we know come along and gather round, just verging on making fun. One of them is Bruce. [Kids are so cruel to each other - a thought I just had as I'm writing this.] I decide I'm not gonna give her my dress and start to button it back up."
"355"	"(12/15/91)"	"I've just gotten married to this wonderful guy who lives in a (little?) suburban house (a sort of 50's-VA-ranch-style). He's got light brown hair, tallish, handsome, friendly, and very sweet. I've only just moved in and still feel very tentative, disoriented. The house has this one big room that he uses as a club on Saturday nights, all the young people come and dance. [We're talking about 20-35 really, age-wise.] We've been getting everything ready, actually he's been running around doing things and I've pitched in where I could. There's also a friend of his - a girl, old friend from school or the neighborhood - helping out, she's very nice, helped me feel welcome. Now people are arriving, quite a lot of them, and there's a lot to do, taking their coats, getting drinks, etc.At some point I've gone to the bathroom, and the door latch wouldn't catch, so I just have to hope nobody walks in. It's a long bathroom with some sort of partition in it, and a worktable. The girlfriend is sitting at it, and my husband apparently starts to come in, because she starts talking to him rather loudly, in such a way as to keep him outside the room, for my benefit. I'm not enjoying all this bustle a lot, and I go off into another part of the house to get away for a while. It's all very new, this place, this town, living with this man, being married - I haven't know him long, we just fell for each other like a ton of bricks and I wanted to be with him so much I'd do anything. Now I'm wondering if I can get used to it, if I fit in. Do I even want to be married? I go across the street and visit with some older neighbors, still feeling confused. After a bit, people start pouring out of the house - first a clump, then a clump, then a stream. They seem to be excited about something, all talking and hurrying. I can't see or hear what's going on so I go out front, and I hear bits of sentences, about fire, and my husband's name. Some of them see me and stop talking, but I also hear, ""(he's) dead"" [I don't know his name] a time or two. I'm dumbfounded. I look at the house, expecting to see flames burst out of the windows, but all there is, is a big plume of white smoke coming from one area of the house. Thoughts go through my head about how ironic it is to be only just married and now not be again, will everything just go back to normal? But I have to know what's happened - I rush into the house, stumbling through rooms, past overturned furniture, till I come to where he is, and he's alive - there are firemen around, they've got the fire out and a lot of things are wet, including my husband. He looks exhausted, and he's very cold, he's done something heroic that saved the day but now he's all wet and suffering somewhat from shock. The girlfriend has a trench coat over his shoulders that she's trying to keep around him, but it's wet too. When I see him I scream and rush to him - suddenly my doubts are all gone, I know I want to be with him whatever it takes, I love him so much. I pull the coat off of him [and either he's naked, or I get his other clothes off him] and hold him tight, wrapping myself around him tight to give him my body heat. He says something about the fire, how apparently it burned up this little wooden thing he'd bought for me, how ironic that was - we'd been talking about it earlier, we'd seen it in a shop or at a craft fair and I'd loved it - a little box of 2 exotic woods, how unusual it was, and it cost $275. That's very expensive, and of course we said we couldn't afford it, but he'd gotten it for me anyway on the sly. I look around to see what happened to it, but I don't spot it, even though I see some other little nice wood things."
"356"	"(12/17/91)"	"I'm in England with some girls - not close friends, but we're travelling together, and we've set up a weekend on a boat up in Scotland before we go home. We all meet in the office of the agent who's setting it up, and she has a little dog (like a Cocker Spaniel) that's one of those nervous, flighty types that try to be friendly and cute but might bite, and I'm scared of her. We have a while to wait, so we sit around the lounge/living room and I try to stay away from the dog. Part of the time there's this huge yacht or boat maneuvering in its slip (which is now where we are, partly inside the room) and some of the machinery swings around and nearly hits me in the head so I have to duck. I'm not at all sure I'm going to like this. But we go. We drive to the location where the boat is, and this road used to be harder to negotiate - now it's been literally divided, there's a wall between lanes so that you can't get on the wrong road - just for a certain stretch, not all the way... We arrive, and there are some others on this outing with us, including Dan & Lynn and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's a sort of guide. We know each other a bit, and spend some time talking, and I'm saying at one point that even though he's done a lot of travelling around the world, I may have done almost as much, even if most of it's been to England - after all, this is my 6th time here. We're hugging close together while we're talking and I'm resting my head on his chest. The others are doing various setting-up chores, and shortly I turn and look at Dan, who's gotten some sort of stinging plant attached to his foot, and he's having to get it off very carefully. It's a sort of clinging water cactus."
"357"	"(12/24/91)"	"I'm in London, just arrived - I'm looking for Geoffrey's apartment, he lives here on some kind of business assignment and I'm going to stay with him. It's a funny kind of place, with apartments going off at odd angles. Here's his, and I'm let in. There are others here, visitors, maybe at least one is a roommate, I don't know. They're all very sociable. Geoffrey is somewhat distracted, he's got something on his mind - I'm quite welcome and he's glad to see me, but he can't give me all his attention, so I poke about on my own. There's a television, and I'd like to turn it on (and maybe I do) - I'd like to be like a little kid, just sit on a cushion and watch cartoons, while the grownups do stuff; but maybe that would look pretty dumb on my first day in London - I should be out sightseeing or something. My glasses are filthy. A girl who's sitting on the couch shows me some glasses cleaner she's just been using - there are a lot of things on the coffee table in front of her, and I'm dubious about using Kleenex on my glasses, but then I figure, what the hell, they're so scratched up now, who would care? So I clean my glasses, and one or two other things as well, including the desk. When I've done that, [either she remarks on it or I notice with horror] that the spots are now a lot worse - in fact it looks like the cleaner has been eating away at the finish! There are a lot of bleached-looking spots in the middle. O dear, Geoffrey's not going to be pleased. I stare for a minute, then dash into the kitchen to find some wood polish. Geoffrey's standing next to the sink talking to another girl, and I grab the bottle of Pledge or something that's standing on the counter. I go back and polish the desk with it. Now what I see is these aren't spots on the finish at all, they're inlays or some design. As the polish restores the shine, the design becomes clear. (This is light wood on dark wood, like mahogany.) It's probably a Greek or Roman scene, somebody in a toga, animals maybe - I can't see the whole thing yet. I am a bit confused - I don't think this was visible before; does Geoffrey know about it? Will he like it when he does? Very odd, this visit, so far."
"358"	"(12/24/91)"	"I'm at a big lecture given by this well-known motivational-self-help guy. I'm helping out for a bit here, listening to him when I can. There are a lot of people here, including a lot of LT people. He sounds pretty good, I'm liking what he says, and his manner. There's this girl - one of his regular staff or helpers - who's been part of the crew I'm with, and suddenly she's getting out of hand, dancing around and flouncing her hair (which is reddish-brown, long and shaggy), she's wearing orange tight pants and a midriff top, no shoes, and now she gets really loud, flouncing by me, asking, ""Have you ever heard of the Barefoot Lesbian?"" And I have no idea what's going on. Meanwhile, the lecturer starts getting more excited and energetic about something, and he's talking about somebody he's calling evil, and starts pounding his palm and raving. I'm thinking, well, this guy sure ain't Brad & Roy after all."
"359"	"(1/15/92)"	"I'm performing - more or less - in a small concert hall/club, it's got regular rows of seats but it's attached to a larger place, entered from a space that's probably a restaurant, regular nightclub, or hotel. In the back of the room there's a small counter with a cash register, and an abbreviated stage in the front. Rolly is going to play piano for the singer, who's black and resembles Catherine [from Preston Royal] (or Oprah Winfrey). She's got on a slinky spangled black dress with long sleeves. I'm in the back of the room; I'm part of the performance [but I don't know what it is I'm doing. Vocal accompaniment? An instrument?] It's almost time for the show to start, and there's some hostility between me and her. It comes down to something she said about my mother, and she thinks I'm prejudiced and I think she's prejudiced. I tell her I won't [do my bit] until she apologizes, and she says she won't sing if I don't. We're still standing there glaring at each other across the room when the crew comes in, and they're in a very good mood, they're playing catch with overgrown vegetables. The stage manager tosses something to me, and I toss it to someone else after a brief pause - I'm confused about the switch in attitudes. Then he brings this gigantic green pepper, that I can't even catch - I have to roll it to somebody, over to the right, and I move toward the right aisle. Then comes a wad of something that I think was spaghetti wrapped in a foil bag, long and rectangular, but it's come loose, and when I catch it I can't lift it up again and toss it, I just fling it but it doesn't go very far. I tell the next guy - a stage hand or somebody - to hold on a second, and I pick it up and wad it back together tighter so I can really throw it. But we have to stop because the audience is coming in and taking their seats. The singer has been just standing there, still pissed off, but now she's walked off. Rolly's been sitting at the piano (in a tux) the whole time, wondering what we're gonna do, and I have the thought that he expects me to handle this. I'm more or less twiddling my thumbs, knowing something's got to be done, but I don't know what. We can't just keep standing here."
"360"	"(1/18/92)"	"The apartment is nearly empty - are we moving in or out or what? There've been some others here but I'm alone at the moment, and I can see out the front window an old woman's getting out of her car with a gift package. I don't want to see her - she's a nuisance. I'm not dressed, either, and I grab a robe and try to get myself covered up in case I'm discovered, and when I see she really is making for the stairs I fumble into the back and try to hide under something. Apparently she goes away, though, and my friends come in. We talk about the plants. I still want to know if I can plant the poinsettias, and I think (Mike?) might know, but he's not sure himself. I notice somebody's moved the hanging baskets. Why? Very strange."
"361"	"(1/19/92)"	"I'm living in a place that used to be a store, and trying to rearrange the furniture. I don't have much, and the place is really bare, but the floor isn't flat - there are steps all the way across the room, starting about a third of the way across. The wall on that side is a plate glass window. So I can't put any furniture on that side of the room, and it's discouraging. At first I think there's only the one room, and I won't be able to get my bed in here, but then I think, well, there's the other room, maybe I can make that the bedroom and this can be the living room. I'll see about that. I'm in a little store right before Christmas, it's dark outside, after work, and the store is dim and nearly empty. There are a few other customers poking around, and we're also trying to solve a puzzle for a contest the store owner has every year - a little thing, you solve the puzzle, blow a little whistle to announce that you did it, and you get a little Christmas trinket. I solve it and go look for the whistle but it's not there. I call out to the owner, ""Are we supposed to just tell you when we've solved the puzzle, or what?"" - he says, yes, that's fine, I'll go get your prize. There's a couple in the store who are really pissed. They think I cheated, and they're grousing to themselves. The owner brings out a bag and empties it out on a counter. I can't tell what it is yet, but it looks very nice, like it came from Neiman's - I figure it's probably something else; but it turns out (the owner says) that it actually is the prize. Oh, boy. Sandie has come by with a friend, and given me a Christmas card she's made from old bits of antique cards. I think it's really nice. There's a part on the front that's incomplete - it used to be a puzzle where you'd take the pieces off and there was another picture underneath. I tell her that it's really swell, she could actually market this. Actually I'm not sure if this is my card from her, or she's just showing me what she'd made."
"362"	"(2/1/92)"	"I'm assisting at a ""race"" event in which Tree is running. There's a man - a trainer, I guess, who's in charge, and he's giving me instructions to do a ""bleeding"" - Tree is not in the best shape and needs a lot of tweaking to have a chance of winning. He's old and has been racing a long time - a real trouper. What I'm supposed to do is cut a short slit in his left front leg and then stop the bleeding. Actually in this sort of ""garage"", near the track, there are lots of Threes up on racks, and I'm supposed to do this to all of them. I'm very hesitant. I do a couple, but I really don't like it. Even though it's a normal thing to do - given that it's just a practice meant to win races or get a slow runner to go faster, I hate to think I'll hurt him, especially if I slip or do it wrong. I go back to the boss and tell him he'll have to do it himself, I can't finish."
"363"	"(2/28/92)"	"I'm just going to the bathroom, I've got a skirt on and I've pulled my pants down, when I hear somebody coming up the steps. I think it must be James, so I leave my pants on the floor and go toward the front door. Before I can get there, it opens - I didn't leave it unlocked, it must have been picked. I yell, Who are you? What do you want? - that sort of thing. He looks at me like I'm a petty annoyance. He looks around like he's deciding what to take or something, and his only response to me is sneering, like, ""Go ahead and scream - nobody will hear you."" But I do scream, knowing that if Tom hears downstairs he'll come out, and maybe others. I manage to get outside and dash down the steps, screaming, help, help, robber, or something. There are some people about, and it takes a few seconds, but they start to pay attention. The man comes out, startled apparently, and makes as if to run away. I start calling out description - he has light brown curly hair, a hat, baggy brown jacket, etc. He looks confused but still trying to be arrogant, makes some threats like, I'll be back, don't you worry. There's a little crowd gathered now, and they look like they'll be all over him if he tries anything. I'm very grateful but still angry. [He goes off in a vehicle, and apparently I chase him, because I encounter him somewhere later, but that part's gone.]"
"364"	"(3/6/92)"	"I'm delivering a car to a man - something he's just bought, a Lincoln Town Car, very nice. I park it and go down the street to find him - he turns out to be an old guy, he's buying the car for nostalgia - it turns out to be an old one, too, but very nicely restored, in excellent condition. I think he's black, tall, friendly, maybe wearing overalls. I show him the car and he drives off. I'm with another girl who drove another car and we start back for it but I look into a shop first - it's got outdoor gear in it - we're on a sort of mall, outdoors but the shops face on a courtyard of bricks. I've got something from the shop just outside the doors, a quilt or something, like I'm trying it on, when it's time to go on for sure so I leave it on the bench. We go further, there's a group now, and we're looking at this office facade for the Honda headquarters. It's quite a large building, and in the center is a fancy door with panels next to it, all heavy wood, impressive. We're curious, so one of us goes up and opens the door and steps through. Then says, ""What a joke! There's nothing over here at all, it's just a door to nothing!"" See, the door isn't set in part of the building, as if multiple stories, it's just somewhat more than door-high, maybe 1 story, and then sky. But you can't see there's no roof. And there's a space nearby, a break in the wall, and the one who went through the door steps through that, showing it's just a facade. We all find this curious and funny, so we go through and find a big stadium-like space between office buildings. Hum. To the right we look into a place and find a church, a service going on (Catholic?). We sit down in the balcony and watch for a while, like an audience. I have a candy bar and I keep eating it. Somebody glares at me, and I feel sort of half-guilty, realizing that it's not really usual to be just watching a church service without taking part in it, and I try to pay attention for a while. But we go on, and eventually I'm with just one girl going back to my car; we pass by a lot of cheerleaders practicing on all sides of this ""mall""-thing. Very strange, it's getting dark now and the stores are closing up, but here's these groups of 'em every so often, and for some reason spaced out so they sort of ring the place. Hum. Passing by the outdoors-shop again, I see they've closed up and left the ""quilt"" still on the bench. O dear. I'd like to do something about it, but there doesn't seem anything to do. We go on to the car./We're going to Jenny's house for a meeting. I can see her and her mother rearranging furniture in a little room to accommodate about 8 of us, they set up 2 couches across from each other./I see Jenny in bed with another woman, kissing - I'm surprised, I didn't know Jenny was bisexual./I see another room, full of tables and chairs (in Jenny's house?) and I remark to my friend, ""Will you look at this furniture? Look at the legs - they're all alike."" All the chairs and tables - it's a sort of parlor, with antiques and chintz, you know the type - have got Queen Anne legs [I didn't use the term till I was writing this] , bowed out at the top, in at the bottom, with a foot. Interesting image. I wonder how it happened."
"365"	"(3/14/92)"	"I seem to be having a romance with Rolly. I'm moving in with him, into this nice suburban house, and it's quite an ordeal, bringing my stuff over in bits and pieces. I feel very awkward about it. Rolly was here but he's gone on to work, and there's a couple of others here helping me, and then we're going somewhere together. One helper is Dan, and he's being quick and efficient but I'm slow. We get out the door and they go on to the street, but I stop at the mailbox - it's huge, with many sections like a brochure rack or something, and there's a lot of mail or something, and there's a lot of mail in it. I thumb through it, thinking maybe there's some for me - earlier at my apartment there was no mail and I was surprised - now I don't see how there could be mail for me here yet, but lo and behold, here's something for Tom Jenner delivered here by mistake, maybe my mail's here after all! There's a section for Trisha here - for some reason Rolly lets her have mail sent here when she's travelling, or between places or something. There's a lot of mail here, and the others are impatient, so I leave it and go on. We haven't gotten but a little way when the other guy mentions leaving the burner on under the teakettle. Says when Rolly gets home it might have developed into a fire or something, maybe we should turn it off. Dan says, nah, never mind, all it'll do is burn the bottom off, it's not worth going back for. So we go a few more steps, but I get nervous about it and dash back. While I'm there (this awkward, uncomfortable feeling is growing) I look around and notice how ""ordinary"" this house is - all neat and well-appointed (it's nicer than Lloyd's house, but likewise has no soul), but I don't want to have to give my place up for this. I observe that I haven't even given notice to the landlord yet, and here I'm moving in - if that doesn't show how reluctant I am, I don't know what does. I'm not as fond of Rolly as all that; I guess I've acted hastily again - I don't want to do this. I make up my mind to go back. I feel better. Still, we've got somewhere to go, me, Dan, and this other guy - I go on out to our vehicle (a van or bus?), and we get on the road. Somewhere at a distance we're stopped, with a large number of other vehicles part way to our destination. It's something like a traffic jam but we're gathered around something, like a kind of building, I guess, and people are milling around, driving motorcycles around, jogging, standing talking in the sun. I've got on rollerblades or something, and I'm very awkward, trying to keep out of people's way. Our other friend takes off around the circuit (on a motorcycle?) (in his underpants? - he's rather stout) and I follow him...I'm riding or driving back to where I'm staying in another town - I'm here on a special trip of some kind, a working trip, and I go somewhere during the day - working, I guess. I can see the skyline in the sunset, and I've just noticed it for real - it's certainly different from home, and I get very homesick, not suddenly, really, I've been feeling sad for a while, not realizing what it was. I wish I could go home now. The branch is remodelling, and they've set up our office cubicles - very colorful, blues and yellows - rather enclosed, with doors. At the other end of the space is a section with some soft carpet and lounge-y furniture, rather juvenile. It's unfinished, but sure looks like a children's play area. I remark on this to (Wayne Gray?), who sheepishly says, well yes, we figured it was the best place for it - out of the way and all. They won't be making that much noise, not all the time anyway... I'm very doubtful. Even if the noise isn't bad, just knowing there's nowhere you can go without being out in public is a nuisance."
"366"	"(3/17/92)"	"I'm with a group of people who are unrelated but living together as a family. I'm visiting, or I've stopped here on my way somewhere. The weather is getting windy and cloudy, and I'm looking out the window. In the distance I see a fast-moving, whirling black cloud showing behind other clouds, and I think it's a tornado. I call out to the others, and some come look. A man tells me, ""That's probably not a tornado - sometimes we get these, they don't touch down."" As it moves, I can see that it's up in the air, very big, very black, but no funnel tip. But as I watch suddenly I see there are things flying up in the air toward it - there are little pavilion tents, cows, pigs, wagons, stuff that belongs at a medieval fair. Huh? [Apparently going outside,] I see that a little way off from the house is indeed a fair, but it's kind of mixed up. I'm not sure if I'm seeing a medieval fair, or a Dickens-y or an Alice in Wonderland theme park. Fun, though. (Is this where I was going in the first place?)"
"367"	"(3/18/92)"	"I'm at work, sort of - haven't started yet, and I'm gonna go around to the cafeteria and get some coffee (this is a very big place - the cafeteria has a full staff and everything). There isn't any made, but the guy behind the counter gives me some orange juice. I taste it but don't want it, I'll make some coffee. I'm still a little groggy, though - I pour the coffee grounds into my orange juice. O dear. I look around nonchalantly to see if anybody's looking, and walk casually out. Nobody notices. I decide to go to the doctor that I heard about from some patrons. He's not far away, I'll just pop in while it's still early. I park my car next to the building, it's just a dirt parking lot with trees around, as if it was out in the country, though it's not. The building is old, converted from something. I go in through an unused room into a little waiting room, very homey, old couches, magazines strewn everywhere. There's several other people there, housewives by the look of them, with one or two kids among 'em. I sit on a couch and start to look at this comic or illustrated book I've brought with me - it's Batman or something. The doctor comes out and calls somebody in - he looks nice, shortish, plumpish, smiling, pleasant face. I eventually realize I haven't told anybody I was coming here and it's almost time to start work. I'd better go on back. Frustrating. I go on out to the street. It's several lanes and fast traffic, how am I going to get across? I wait a while and then realize I left my car in the parking lot back there. Good grief, what a dork. Better turn around."
"368"	"(3/22/92)"	"I'm at a TV studio with a small package that I'm supposed to give to Billy Connolly and the actress who plays his wife on the TV show ""Billy"". It's white and not wrapped up as usual, but in 2 pieces, and none too neatly. It contains some odd, ""found""-looking, old things. I don't know where to find them, and as soon as I step into the building I start seeing people I know - mostly from LT, but not all. I stop and chat from time to time. As I'm talking to someone else, I get squeezed around the neck by someone just coming by, and I lean back and see it's Annarae. I hug back and say hi. (She's wearing a peach sweater, and I seem to think she's got some trouble - we don't talk about it, but I feel sympathetic. I let these people go on and I start back for some offices I passed back a while ago. I have to stop for a minute and squat down to fix my shoe or something, and a weight bears down on my back, driving me to the floor. It's a man - I don't know him but I know who he is, and this is his idea of some sort of joke greeting. A couple of other people come up - they tell me who he is - and say to him how stupid he is, get off her. He doesn't, and I gather my energy and roll over with him, heaving him sideways and flinging him to the floor. I tell him if he doesn't get off I'll roll up like a hedgehog and fling him all over the hallway. Finally he does and I thank the others and go on. By this time I'm thoroughly frazzled. I find a reception desk and a girl there tells me where I can find the actors' manager (or agent or maybe the director, I forget). I go that way and find his office, which is very small and has some wall shelves with books and knickknacks on. I look at a couple while I explain my business and he looks at the package. He says he'll see it gets there for me, I thank him and go."
"369"	"(3/24/92)"	"I'm babysitting or some such for a well-to-do family in (some place like South Africa, at the bottom of a continent a long way from home). The folks have come home, and someone else is here to babysit, the person I was sitting in for. The mother, a middleaged, very prim, stuffy woman, sends me on a trip to the grocery store. It's a pretty fair piece, but easy enough to find, straight down the road, turn (left?) and then you come to the (village?). I set out walking, and Linda is going to come after me shortly on a bicycle. The road is black dirt, quite rutted, through open fields. Connie comes along too, and before long we have to dodge some riders on horseback coming up the road, joyriding, all togged out in habits. They're not exactly polite, blundering through, it's up to us to get out of the way on the side of the road. Way down at the end are some houses, and they're quite nice, though not large and mansion-like, like the house I'm visiting. There are lots of trees here, tropical-looking ones, making it seem quite dark, and it is approaching twilight. I'm thinking the road dead-ends and we'll have to go through people's yards if we go anywhere from here, but by George the road does turn (we go right) and continues to a sort of country general store. Inside there's a youngish guy who's also (the local preacher? schoolteacher?) - you give him your order and he packs it up. We're getting some meat, and there's some question of whether we want the good stuff or the not-so-good stuff. [I can't distinguish whether it's the family getting the first-quality and buying seconds for visitors and servants, or the shopkeeper gets all the good stuff for himself. Now I think it's the former.] I have to go to the bathroom, and I go around to it, a very simple place this is, white clapboard, plain countrified, white inside, like an old schoolroom. He comes in while I'm on the toilet, to get something, but he doesn't look, though I'm thinking this is a tacky and manipulative thing to do. He leaves, and someone (a man, but not necessarily the shopkeeper) just peeks in the door briefly right after. I'm having trouble getting started urinating because of all this. [Woke up here, actually needing to pee.]"
"370"	"(3/25/92)"	"I'm at the downtown library, visiting, looking around at some of my old haunts [it looks nothing like the real thing] . I greet a few people, notice how some things have changed. I run into Gail , and she's showing me some piece of equipment or furniture, and we're talking generally. (It's night, or getting there, not many people about, there's a subdued, quiet atmosphere.) We get to talking about animals, she says somebody we both know has a certain kind of pet, and I'm surprised. She says, oh yeah, and somebody else has this one, and somebody else has that one, etc. - but I don't know why I should tell you all this, you can read it yourself if you want to. She gives me a printout list from a drawer in this cabinet-thing we're looking at. Apparently this was made up for some charity project. I take it and put it in my purse to look at later. We continue talking, and she gives me another list or document, which is definitely not for general circulation. She says, ""You know I never gave you this..."", and I agree. A bit later, after I'm off on my own again, I'm squatting down by a cabinet and my purse is behind me. Both papers are in it, and I knock it over, and the one about pets falls out. Just then Marsha comes by, and she sees the paper. I say hi, picking up my purse and the paper, trying to make sure the other one isn't visible, without letting her see I'm hiding something. She does see the pets one, though, and takes it. (I think she asks for it and I hand it to her.) She turns away for a minute, and I stick the other one into the cabinet, thinking I'll retrieve it later. But Marsha's very serious when she turns back - she asks where I got this, and I tell her, wondering why she's so disturbed. But she tells me I can get into a lot of trouble for this, asks why I took it, I tell her we were just talking about pets, no big deal, what's the problem? She says this is private information. She thinks for a bit, says probably they'll have me buy pets for the children. I tell her I still don't understand what the problem is, and she opens the printout to show me the title - it says ""Mi Panin"" something something (the printout is all caps, of course) - it means nothing to me at all. At first I thought the word was ""panic"" but I can see it's not. I am still mystified by this whole thing - part of me is concerned that I shouldn't get caught with the other paper, I'd really be canned for that, I am really worried. But the pets one - I keep expecting I can just explain about that, but Marsha is really adamant."
"371"	"(4/1/92)"	"I'm arriving at my grandparents' house on Vanderbilt - they're out, and I want to use their house for something, though I'm terrified they'll come home while I'm still here. (I haven't seen them or most of the rest of my family in years.) It's still just as it was, and frankly I'm surprised. You'd think they'd have remodelled a bit. I look around downstairs, going into the kitchen from the dining room, and on through, suddenly realizing I haven't seen a microwave - I'm looking for one, because I want to use it - surely they've gotten a microwave, wouldn't somebody at least have given them one by now? I go back through, looking carefully, going from the dining room into the room where the sink is - noticing I'd forgotten that the part where the stove, etc., is has no sink - you have to wash dishes in a separate room. Funny. [Note this is inaccurate from the real house; it's as if you'd put a wall in the real kitchen (and moved the refrigerator), but it was never like that.] But no microwave. Oh, well. I go toward the bathroom, and just as I'm crossing the den, the bathroom door opens and a naked girl starts to come out. She has a towel or something and covers herself up somewhat, very startled, and retreats inside the door. I ask who she is and she says she's a reporter or something, works for the newspaper (?), she's sorry, she was just taking a bath, didn't know anybody would be here, etc. - I notice she doesn't tell me exactly what she's supposed to be doing here. I'm a little afraid, because especially I don't know if she's alone. I start thinking about calling the police, and I try to see inside the bathroom beyond her, though she's holding the door as if to prevent it. I explain who I am, but she doesn't know I barely have a right to be here either, and I hope she doesn't ask. I have a bit of an upper hand but I'm worried that there's something potentially dangerous here, and I'm more and more suspicious that there's a man with her - which would make the situation worse. I jostle the door and make more of an effort to look in, and by George there is a man in there! He's naked, and just in the tub - I see him reflected in the bathroom mirror, trying to keep quiet and out of sight. I'll bet she notices me looking and figures I've seen. My apprehension escalates - I'm gonna go call the cops. I go through to the dining room where the phone is, hoping I can make the call before they come after me. I get the number dialled, and I hear sounds while it's ringing, and just as someone picks it up (I think - I'm not positive because I have one ear listening to the sounds at the door) the doorbell rings. I debate whether to answer it or make the call, and in frustration put the phone down. I answer the door, and it's a whole raft of people, some of whom I recognize, all dressed up in their Sunday-go-to-meetin' clothes. Apparently there's been a wedding or some similar celebration, and the reception/party's being held here. Oh swell. I'm greeted warmly, like I belong here - some of these people are distant relatives, and they're all on a kind of churchy-Sunday high. There are black people here too, and I talk to one woman in a springy flowery dress and hat, with her daughter, similarly dressed - I wonder if I should tell them what's been going on, or are these people somehow dangerous too? Maybe I should just sneak out. I'm feeling confused and frustrated."
"372"	"(4/5/92)"	"I'm at home - I live with my family - and I'm late for work, I suddenly discover - got about 15 min. and I'm confused. I start to move fast, thinking about my hair, and get deodorant on, then realize I need a shower and shampoo. Damn. I hope I can get by with perfume. This is terrible. I keep looking out the window at the bus stop as if I could run down and catch it if it was in sight. (No way.) In the bathroom, the little cabinet has been moved forward of where it's supposed to be, next to the toilet, against the shelf - I make some snotty remark about slovenly people - the place is a mess anyway, stuff all over the counter, including the boxes of curlers my mom uses. I've got 2 of them in my hair, actually, last night having hoped they would help. I push the cabinet back where it should be, and start to pull the curlers out, wondering what I should do first."
"373"	"(4/11/92)"	"I live in a big busy apartment complex. My front door is at the top of a long steep ramp. I decide to go out for something, and as I get to the ground I realize I've left the door open. Uh-oh, the cats'll get out! I turn and look, and by George, there's Rouse on the ramp all right; I shoo her back up and she goes, but there's Alleycat down next to a tree. I call to him - he ducks around some, and I move as if to chase him, but I realize the door's still open. I'd better go on up. There's a guy speaking to me, he wants to ask me something or tell me something, I guess, and I tell him I've got to go in - he says he'll help me get my cat, I say no thanks, and he follows me up - inside the door I say again, I'll just wait, Alleycat will come in on his own, and, lo and behold, just as I turn to the door, there he is. I shut the door behind him. [This guy is somebody I know - and in real life he's somebody well known, like a TV personality, but I don't know him personally.] Later, I'm out in the complex on my way wherever I was going, and I'm walking along under the upstairs walkway. It's started to rain, and up ahead at the end of the walkway I see this heavy gush of dirty water come over the edge. I assume it's a torrential overflow, and don't want to get caught in it, so I wait. After a minute I realize that things haven't changed much up there, you can still see the dark water hanging over the edge - but that's silly, what's wrong here? I look closer, realizing it isn't making a sound any more either. It's stationary. Coming out past it - the rain had after all stopped - I can see - oh my word, it's a dog! This huge English sheepdog that lives upstairs is trying to escape from a bath - he's covered with muddy water and sort of wrapped up in a big brown plastic trash bag or something, and he's tried to jump over the edge and got caught, so he's just hanging there. He's trying to wriggle loose, and does, and hits the ground in a loud wet-bag sploosh. Not far in front of me, and he's wiggling and wagging his huge tail around to get out of the plastic. I get smacked with the tail - in the bag - just before he gets free, but I think I can try to help get him stopped before he runs off, and his owner comes up and is grabbing for him too. VK & I have been at a woman's house on some errand - he needed to make some arrangements with her about a project she's doing with, or for, the library, and I came to help. That having been settled, we're on our way back in our mobile office cubicles. This thing is like 2 little desk-cubicles (like the downtown library has), one behind the other, opening to the left. I step into mine and sit down, then VK gets into his and he starts it up and we drive away like a motor scooter or something - he has a steering wheel. I need to ask him a question, and I step out, not thinking at first that it may go too fast for me to keep up with, but realizing quickly that if I just keep a lively step going, I can stay on a level with VK - I go ahead and check with him [on whatever it was I wanted to know] ."
"374"	"(4/13/92)"	"I live with John Cleese and his wife - they're not my parents but my guardians, and I help them out in the business. We make something and sell it. I've just come in from outside, and there's a guy over by one of the machines trying to get a sample of some stuff, and he's going away leaving the spigot dripping from the ceiling (way up above). I'm looking at it, trying to figure out what to do next - I stick my finger in it to taste it, and it's going faster now, turning into a stream. John Cleese arrives, horrified, saying we've got to fix it - he's talking quietly so as not to disturb the customers or appear upset, but he's pissed. He mutters ""cream"" as he's turning to go fix it, and I call out - ""Uh, it's caramel"" after him (the stuff is a stream of caramel rather like the cajeta sauce at A fast food chain). I don't think he hears me... In another room, which is huge like a gym and has some equipment in it, I'm watching John up on a high wire on a bicycle - he's got one of those long poles. He's going to work on some sort of machinery and this is the only way to get to it."
"375"	"(4/19/92)"	"I'm in some kind of storeroom or lower-level workroom, cinderblock walls, high ceiling, various things stacked in different places, a work-table or desk, maybe a file cabinet or something. I have come in here with a man for some legitimate reason, we work together (more or less - the relationship is not close). But now he's attacked me - another person has come in and they're talking about raping me, but something has to be done first - they're waiting for somebody else. They're very threatening, taunting, mean. Shortly the second one goes out and returns almost immediately with several more men - all of them looking tough and mean, like gangsters. They're engaged in some activity [though I can't identify it - not just a conversation, and while they're quite visible I just can't say what they're doing - the first guy is definitely the boss though, and they look to him rather than paying attention to me - my understanding is that they're all going to rape me] - but for the moment nobody is looking at me, and I see the door's been left open. I'm close enough to it that I can get out without going in front of any of them, so I seize the opportunity and slip out quick, then run as quiet as I can - I make it to the elevator just in time, I don't even know if they're chasing me yet, I just assume they are. I go up to the first floor and get out, running out the door, aiming more or less toward home, across the field. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going, though I think briefly about calling the police and where I can do that. In my path, however, I see the [train] where Rita is at the moment - that'll do it, I'll get her to help. Nobody's in sight chasing me at the moment, so I go around to the door and go in. Rita's there, and we talk. She says I should join her, and we'll go see somebody. After a while the train moves on, and we arrive soon at a place with a house and lots of trees where the owner lives and has invited us to dinner. Very friendly, I'm honored. [The previous incident might have been forgotten, or it's metamorphosed into this one.] It's twilight now, through the trees - a lovely place. I'm a policeman or security cop, rather new, working with my buddies, who I think include Lynn & Peggy, in this little rustic-looking office in a small town or neighborhood. It's night, and not much to do, and we're messing around having fun. Somebody sees the guy who's bringing our paychecks coming down the street, and we quickly dash back in, giggling and joking - I suggest we all sit down on our benches very straight and upright, with straight faces, all in neat rows, so he'll think we're real serious. (We're all rookies, by the way.) We just barely make it, and I'm fumbling to turn on the tape player for the soothing music just as he comes in the door."
"376"	"(5/19/92)"	"I'm at a big house with a big pool behind it, a kind of meeting place/resort - you book into it for parties or suchlike, and I'm here as part of something, but wanting to leave. I've been in the house with my friend, and now I'm just going out past the pool, but lo and behold, down at this end you have to walk into the water on wood steps and things. Crossing to a kind of raft-thing, I then find there's no more steps all the way through this barn-like structure to the outside. I'm at a loss for a while - I'm in shorts, etc., not dressed for swimming, and not keen on it anyway. But I guess I have to, so I get down into it and find I can tread okay, I don't sink in all the way. I go on out and then realize I've left my purse and notebook on the raft. Damn. I have to go back for them, no help for it, so I do. There are a lot more people on it now, and I'm worried for a minute that my purse may not be there, but it is, almost under some others and between a couple of women sitting on each side. I get my things and [go out again? no continuity.]"
"377"	"(5/19/92)"	"...Bopping down the street to music, I have to make a U-turn, and pass a couple of teenage boys on bikes - they look at me carefully to see if they can tell how old I am, very confused. I'm pleased with myself for looking and acting the way I like. I go on into this [cafeteria/bicycle shop?] , and I'm talking to a young man at the counter - a family owns this place, and he's the son, there's others here. He responds for a bit, I'm asking where to buy a certain kind of used bike or can I get one repaired, and finally he just doesn't answer, wanders off. I go to his dad at the cash register. I try to tell him about it, and he ignores me too. They all do. I'm amazed and disappointed. I leave feeling incomplete, and go on back to the other place, only now it's late afternoon and there's not many people about, out in this end, a kind of long shed before the watery barn, there are tables - like picnic tables - but they're all wet now. I need to put my stuff down, but I have to look around before I find one that's not all over waterlogged. There are several large trays of leftover food, like party trays, fruit on lettuce, etc., that I'm planning to take along with me when we leave, but now I have the dilemma of how to get them across the water. This is a tough one. I've just been munching on something, a cookie maybe, and still chewing, and this guy comes up - he's one of the two guys who run this place - rather tall, burly, and means business, no nonsense. He says in no uncertain terms that ""snack time is over"" - meaning a sort of set tea that they have here, and I'm not supposed to be having ""snacks"" now - never mind that I haven't been here for their ""snack time"" and I'm eating my own whatsit. I get started organizing the trays to take across, when it suddenly hits me - I don't have to do this, you can just walk from the front of the house down the street past the pool to here. Well, I think, never mind, this way is shorter. [Another place] An old, dark wood church - my boyfriend (My ex?) and I have been roller-skating or something around here, and meant to go back through the back door to the front and outside, but there are some people here now - apparently getting something organized - and we have to be quiet and not attract too much attention. Outside, the street curves downward a lot, it's going to be mucho fun to whiz down. [Another place] I'm with a Mexican lady who has pottery to sell in an outdoor market. I need to pee quite a lot, but can't go to the bathroom, and I figure while she's not looking I can pee in one of the pots and then wipe it out. I try it one place, realize I'm too exposed, and move along a bit to a spot near an archway/alcove and find a big tall pot - I can just be sitting on it instead of squatting. But there's a man just ahead, he may look my way, and while keeping an eye on him I ease the pot off its ledge and down (with me on top of it) among some others sitting on the ground. I realize I must look very embarrassing."
"378"	"(5/20/92)"	"I'm at the desk in the library, and it's very busy just as we're getting ready to close. The place is huge, and the desk is long - someone else is checking out, and I'm at the money box. There are tables spread out in front of me, people everywhere, sounds of people talking, and plenty of kids. The light is more like a nightclub or something, mostly dark but with spots of light - a sort of overhead darkness [like yoga at Moonslice] . Actually my sense of the place is chaotic. I have the money drawer open, and something is dropped on the floor. I try to catch it, but don't, and then bend or squat to reach it. At the same time a little girl who's been boosted up to sit on the counter is crawling over it and letting herself down on my side. She's definitely in my way, and I tell her not to do that, but here she comes anyway. I've got my right hand in the drawer still, pushing it in as far as I can without closing it, but trying to make it so nobody can reach across the counter into it. I signal to Jenny at the other end of the counter to come get this kid, and she does, trying to be nice, but I'm saying, this is not okay for you to be here, you have to stay on the floor on the other side of the counter. No fooling. As I stand up, feeling more frustrated, there are 3 heads in front of me, 2 or 3 hands reaching across the counter trying to get into the money drawer. Now I get very imperious, and tell these kids - all boys - in no uncertain terms, get off the counter, stand on the floor, and stay there. Jenny (and maybe some others) look at me like I'm being awfully bold, here we are supposed to be nice to all the patrons, but my attitude at the moment is that I'd better let people know who's in charge here. Things are getting out of hand. Actually, the ""boy"" in the middle turns out to be a man, and he's miffed, because he just wanted change. I tell him that's fine and start counting out some ones, but they're all bad. In fact, there don't seem to be any nice clean flat bills at all - my word, here's one that's positively white! No, it's blank on one side - damn, this has got to be a Xerox copy! Here's another one! This is awful! Who took such bills? I look at another stack - there's quite a lot here - and find a nice bill, but damn! It's from a foreign country! It doesn't look anything like our bills! How could this happen? Here's another one - from the ""Bank of Habbakuk"" or some such name. O dear. The man is getting impatient, and says he'll take anything - I'm terribly embarrassed to have to tell him I haven't found anything he could spend yet. There's still a lot else going on around me, and suddenly the lights flick on & off, making me even more confused. It's one of our people over at the light switch down at the end of the counter, on the wall. He's just trying to get the patrons' attention, that it's time to leave. But with the light already the way it is, it's very disorienting. We tell him to stop. I'm just horrified at this situation with the money."
"379"	"(5/20/92)"	"I'm taking my car to Belmont Garage to get worked on, early early in the morning, and there's a new guy behind the counter who looks and sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's got on your basic mechanics' blue shirt and pants, and really doesn't look like him in the face, but everything else about him is a dead ringer - voice, accent, size, muscles, it's quite weird. We talk about the car, and he walks me outside to look at it, and I'm going to go on down the street to have breakfast. While he talks to me, I get very attracted to him, and he's being a little more than polite himself. In fact, he offers to walk along with me, and that's just fine. I'm still marvelling at how I could swear I'm with Arnold, except his face just looks different for the moment - or maybe this is how he ""really"" looks. Golly. So we walk along, and he even holds my hand, he's getting very attentive, this is swell. We get to the cafe, and I'm meeting some friends, who are around a table already - we'll have to squeeze in with extra chairs. There's some shuffling, me getting 2 chairs, somebody else getting one, taking back, putting in, then we get settled. This is a cute little place, close, chintzed-up, white with blue flowers, captain's chairs, early American, da da. We chat for a bit, and then I get up to do something at the next table, which is empty. [It has something to do with sorting keys or something, that relates to work, but I'm not getting it now - me and somebody else have these things out on the table, when these 2 ladies come along to sit there, and I apologize, clearing them off right away.]"
"380"	"(5/20/92)"	"I'm at my Mom's, and she's got some shampoo that you don't have to use with water - it's a liquid gel, and you spread it on your hair with your hands, then you have to wipe them on something - and she says this is a good thing to do to keep the cats clean - you just wipe your hands on them. We're in the living room, they're sitting in chairs (like the real ones, but the whole room is a little different) - it's night and the lamps are on, yellow light."
"381"	"(5/24/92)"	"I'm with a group of people in a large building (house? - not where we live, though), and there's been a major altercation between this one man and another. It's over a misunderstanding but the one guy is distraught and won't listen to anybody, he wants to kill the other guy, and he's tough enough to do it. (He's not especially large, but strong, big shoulders, Italian-looking, sleeves rolled up, sort of Springsteen-Fonzie-like.) All these people are friends, and we want to prevent this, but the first guy goes off to get something [I presume he announces he's going for the sledgehammer which is in another place in the building - in any case, we know that's what he's doing] , and I say to the others, ""Oh no - if he's going for the hammer, the only one back there is the big one"" - meaning there's regular ones, and a huge iron one that won't break, and is far more dangerous than the other kind. We're all frightened, and I wonder if I should go after the guy, but I don't think I could change his mind, and he might hurt me. We're all anxious to keep the other guy protected, but don't quite know how to do that. It's not like we're used to violence. We move to another room, but the first guy catches up with us, and there's a confrontation. Several tense moments pass, and then the violent guy breaks down - he can't do it, drops the hammer and his head, and cries. I feel so sorry for him - and then I feel guilty because I should've gone after him, even if I couldn't stop him, I should have stood with him, let him know he wasn't alone, that I cared that he was hurting. I really feel sad. Later, feeling I need to get out somewhere, I'm taking a thing back to someone who'd left it - it's somewhere between a metal folding chair and a child's wagon - and I'm going along a neighborhood path. It's night, though there are lights somewhere, I can see fine. This path goes along a creek or something, and there's trees and large bushes, which in one place get so thick I can't go on the path any more. I look around, thinking I could go behind this house and then between it and the next one, but it's late, people are probably in bed, they probably wouldn't like hearing a disturbance right by their houses. I decide to get back to the path by cutting through a more open place in the foliage, cutting off the bend. (At some point it is discovered that Whoopi Goldberg's name and address are on this article - I had previously found a different name on the front, and I was taking it to her, but someone pointed out the other name - I have to choose, so I figure I'll carry on as I am, and will find out later if it should go to Whoopi.)"
"382"	"(5/27/92)"	"I'm with somebody at (a/the?) library, looking in a large cabinet for a short cardboard tube that I can put something in - there's lots of cardboard here, being saved for projects, all sizes and colors, including a few tubes, most of which are too long and thin. Here's one, probably a paper-towel roll, flimsier but maybe... I go check it out but it's too short. I find a little Christmas wrapping paper on a couple rolls, and remark to the person I'm with, ""Hey, maybe we should use this"" - meaning, use it up instead of what she just got new - but we both say, ""Nah - leave it,"" thinking why bother, let's just use all the same paper for everything. While I'm here, a guy comes along that we'd been told was coming to see someone here about the way we do something, or some equipment we use. He's introduced, but he doesn't get that we work here, I think he thinks we're also visitors or library patrons. Well, never mind, it doesn't matter. I go on out, got to get back somewhere, and I'm stepping off the sidewalk when a car comes swooping along and almost hits me. I wave my arms and yell after her, ""You almost hit me!"" but she doesn't stop - it's a woman with short brown hair in a light blue compact car - and I chase after her a bit, trying to get her to notice what she's doing. She turns around abruptly (the car, I mean) and drives up over the curb onto the sidewalk and toward an opening between a couple of stores. I realize suddenly, she's the one who does that all the time - I hadn't recognized her before. I wish there was a policeman here, wish someone would stop her. I run after her a little more, trying to see her license number, but it's a little out of range. At least maybe she'll think I saw it - but I bet that wouldn't impress her. I go on, carrying my stuff (I've got some bundles or something in my arms, that's why I couldn't run too good), and see across the street a little ahead, Gary Sheets and another friend I'm supposed to catch up with. I start to hurry forward, and about the same time pass by a closed-up storefront restaurant that used to be a chicken place. There's a sign posted that I notice, it says, ""(something about fried chicken dinner) - $1.50"", and I think how interesting that is, you mean it's been closed up that long? - I thought surely it would've been something since the chicken place. And it sure has been a long time, when was a chicken plate $1.50? Boy. There was something else above that, I hadn't looked at it, but now I'm past. I think I want to see. I should go on, though - but I want to tell Sheets about this, poof. Well, I settle on going back quickly to look, and it says something similar about maybe meat loaf or roast beef. Hokay. I bustle along, and cross the street to catch up with the guys. I tell Sheets about the restaurant, and he's amused too, as I thought he would be. We walk along, beside an open space at least a block in dimension, a sort of park - green grass, a few trees along the perimeter, people walking around. Down at this end there's a line of booths like a fair or carnival might have, all along the short edge and around each corner. (This is at least semi-permanent, no surprise, I'm not taking much notice of it.) Today, I'm seeing something different than usual - above the booths there are large rectangles of color, various patterns, mostly pastels, they look very pretty against the sky. I assume they're just decorative, and I look at them as I go by. (This is on my way home.) As I get closer, though, I realize they're not just painted cloth like banners, they're heavier. I think they're rugs. Wow. My brother and the other guy have drifted away a bit, looking at something, so I have to go back over to them to tell them about this, and we look around for the booth that's selling them. I might just be interested."
"383"	"(6/6/92)"	"I've come to the Business Office for a little visit with Michelle and to bring her a list of some stuff we want to get rid of from the branch. It's actually in the form of a ""catalog"", with pictures stuck to white pages and some kind of ring binder. I'm trying to interest Michelle casually in some of the stuff to keep, but we joke about it. I look at the rest of the office - it's been changed quite a lot by taking down some of the walls, and now Norma & Marilyn can work together easier, everybody moves around, very open. I'm not going to stay long, so I don't want to get into any conversations with any of the others. [Note: the personnel are accurate, and the overall design of the office.] I go down the back hall to the bathroom and chat with some other folks along the way. There's a stray kitty here, and I think I'd better take him along and take care of him - maybe I'll see if Michelle wants him. But I decide to go back by way of the first floor, and when I get around to the front I realize, whoops, probably I shouldn't go across the public area with a cat, I'd better go back to the staff elevators. [This place is looking more like a hotel than a library - flowered carpet, fancy appointments, etc.] At the elevator we have to wait with some other folks for a while, and I examine the cat's stomach. I had noticed earlier a kind of rough spot, thinking it was a sticker or burr stuck to his fur. It's not, though, it's some kind of hard thing that's burrowed into his skin, and the top of it protrudes. Looks like he'll need to have that removed. The elevator comes, and we squeeze in - it has a glass wall, though there's not much to see outside - there's a person next to me, against the back wall, that looks like a homeless person, and smells a bit. He/she says something to me, but he/she looks and sounds rather sinister and I try to ignore it. By the time we get off, the kitty's missing (in the shuffle) and I have to look for it. ------scene shift------- I'm at Hope's house (Hope and her mom, actually) - they're out and I'm house-sitting; I'm stepping outside to look for the cat on the street (it's night now), and I walk up a bit, nearly out of the light from the sliding glass doors, and I see some movement. There's a cat, but not mine, and a man's shape is moving toward me. As he becomes visible, I see (having been nervous) that he's a neighbor - tall, black, greying, a nice man, though taciturn - and we say hello, I tell him what I'm doing. [I'm not sure about the next part, if my cat shows up or not, but I'm trying to get in the door, or let my cat in, and a number of other cats slip in while I have the door open a crack.] He offers to help me get the other cats out, so we go inside. There's a long table laid with food for guests, and some people start to show up and sit down. Some have brought others with them, and pretty soon the place is bustling with chatty people crowding in. I'm very much disconcerted - some of these are very colorful people, like we found them at a carnival. A few biker types, but all quite friendly. What am I going to do with all these people? Hope comes home and is surprised. [Maybe another scene, I'm fiddling with my tooth - the capped one - and convinced it's loose, I actually pull it loose, I'm horrified.]"
"384"	"(6/7/92)"	"My mother's recently married Patrick Duffy - he has an interfering ex-wife. We're sitting at dinner and he talks about her walking in from time to time. Oh, swell - she's probably my age and I have to contend with a stepmother. I'm visiting Jerry Seinfeld at his apartment, and we decide to get married. It's pretty casual - seems like a convenience thing, although underneath we really like each other, but we're both hesitant because we don't know each other very well. He takes my notebook and writes some information about himself on it, birthdate, parents' names, etc. There's someone else here, a friend of his, and he's kind of doubtful too but thinks it's fun. I need to leave, and go out to my car - the apartment is inside a building, the door is heavy. Crossing the courtyard, there's a lawn, like a park, people are playing on it - I pass some kids on my left, then have to skirt a pond. It doesn't have any edges, it soaks out of its perimeters gradually, and the grass around it is spongy and wet. I don't get far enough out because of the kids and my shoes get wet. [I either fall down or stumble] and drop this little mermaid that Jerry gave me into the pond. It's very shallow and clear, and there are a number of ornaments like this already in it - it crosses my mind I might pick up something else besides my own, but I want mine - they're gold, they float, some are like my mermaid in that they have no floating base, but a solid, curved extension with a ball on the end that keeps them balancing. I pick up my own and go on out. There's a glass door, then a bit of parking lot next to the street. My car is parked right next to the wall, and is nearly pinned in by the next car, parked at an angle, and some sort of rack-thing in front. I walk around the car, checking what I can do, taking off my red coat, and when I get back to the other side I decide I can move the rack - but I notice I don't have my coat. There's someone else with me, a sort of companion, and I ask her if she saw what I did with it - maybe I hung it on that rack. She doesn't see it at first, but then finds it."
"385"	"(6/7/92)"	"I'm in Florida, married, in a house with (family?) - Jack Palance is here, and a woman [his wife?] , and we've been mentioning the electricity, it's had to be cut off and restored because of some external problem. I pick up the phone to call MasterCard about my balance, but there's no dial tone. Just about the same time Jack plugs the transformer into the wall, and then a tone comes on. He rigged that to disconnect, too, to save trouble and electricity. Not a bad idea. I call, and find that I can't get the information without calling The city - a man at a bank here tells me he can't get access to that information, I'll have to transfer my account to Florida. I'm very concerned about that - what if I get it transferred? That's so permanent, do I want to do that? What if I change my mind? --------- Later, being outside at the beach, I feel confused but optimistic - here I am married to a nice-looking guy, and in a place where everybody goes to the beach, my being fat doesn't seem to matter so much. I picture myself having a ball playing with people in the water, relaxing in the sun. I wonder what it would be like to want to stay in Florida. I'm in a store, something like a grocery store, and we're closing for the day. Harry Anderson is my boss, but we're quite close. There's some kind of apprehension, like someone's liable to break in and we have to be real careful to lock up. I try a side door that usually isn't opened, and by George it is. I call to Harry to come lock it, and he doesn't come right away, he thinks I'm mistaken, and I have to urge him. I'm quite concerned, keep watching out."
"386"	"(6/8/92)"	"I'm with Dan & Lynn and Peggy & James at some kind of fair - seems to be on city streets - there's a lot of activity, and you can sit down and watch programs from time to time. We've been doing that, and I've been keeping an eye on this model of a temple (some famous ancient, maybe Biblical temple), which was flooded and I guess destroyed, which was its claim to fame. [I'm not sure if we're all watching this or if I'm watching it on the side - I have bought the model for myself, and I think it's the latter.] The water comes up and rushes through, knocking things down and so on, then recedes, how interesting. The program ends, and we'll be getting up to go elsewhere, but I'd better put this in the car or else it'll get lost, stolen, or thrown out. The car's just here, and I start to deal with it, but the others are going away - they're not even paying any attention to me, except James, who is looking like he can't figure out what to do, to stay or go, to protest or not. I'm aghast. How can they just walk off and leave me? I stand in frustration, what can I do here? They'll be swallowed up by the crowd in a minute, how will I ever catch up to them? Do I even want to? I'm so furious I'd just be - prefer to be - enraged at them. But apparently they're oblivious anyway. Damn... There's a cop or security guard nearby who offers to help, and we get to talking [much like me & Russ at the Jewelry Workshop] , which makes me feel better. We go nearby to his house, while he picks up something, and we're gonna catch a movie on TV. I've got a carton of Cookie Dough ice cream, and eat some while he's in the other room. When he comes back I offer him some, saying, ""Have you ever tasted this?"" And then when I'm looking away, he eats all the rest of it. More frustration. I'm just fed up."
"387"	"(6/24/92)"	"I'm in a foreign country, maybe Eastern Europe, with a group of people - we're here for a LT, this country's first. Right now we're watching a movie, maybe in a bus. At least it's a narrow and short place, not a theatre at all, and we're sitting close together. I've been out, and come back to find my order has arrived - Elsa is keeping it for me - there's a big bowl of hot fudge, a wide shallow bowl [abt. 4"" x 14""] , it's wonderful, dark, bubbly, still hot; chocolate-chunk cookies [big ones like you get at The supermarket] , I can dunk them in the hot fudge; and some other chocolate stuff. It's an awful lot, and looks extremely self-indulgent. I can share, but still I wonder what the others must think of this pile of chocolate... Later, we go to our hotel and have dinner - the rest of the chocolate stuff comes with me - in a dining room with a long table. I get up to go to the bathroom, my room is nearby; the room and bathroom are kind of bare, cheapish, sort of what you might expect in a poor country. While I'm there, the toilet slides out from next to the sink and outside, down the street. This is not especially uncommon, although it is disconcerting. I think I should put it back where it was. I'm now next to a park, on a broad street. There's not much traffic, but people I know are nearby, and I ought to go along with them, but I tell them I'm going to push the toilet back into my room... At some point I'm concerned about Tree's food, where I can get the right kind of kidney food that he needs. I only brought one can with me and I don't think that'll last."
"388"	"(6/27/92)"	"I'm out on my bicycle, riding with a black man [I know him, but I think I work with him, not a friend socially] - we're in a part of town like maybe the Love Field area, or some parts of Oak town - away from downtown, run down. We're crossing a big intersection at a light, there are stores set back from the street. Another man (also black) on a bicycle passes us going the other way, and as he comes to the intersection he raises his arm high in the air, hand straight. So does the man I'm with. I'm guessing that it's some sort of bicycle road signal, indicating that you're going to cross the intersection - I never heard of it before. Hmm. But they keep their arms up as they pass each other, and when they're close to, they acknowledge each other, then drop their arms after they've passed. Oh - I guess it was a black salute of some kind. Hmm. Just at the other side of the intersection, another vehicle turns out of the parking lot to our left (it's on a rise) and passes us crossing the street, and its driver gives the same salute. This thing is a kind of pedal cart, the driver at the back, a passenger sitting on a chair, sideways - it's a woman, white, the driver's a black man - on a platform. Looks a little clumsy, but they seem quite comfortable with it. Hmm."
"389"	"(6/27/92)"	"I'm with 3 friends, another girl and a couple of boys. We're out just sort of strolling around a park, noplace special to get to, but more or less aiming for the other side. There's lots of dense green stuff to poke through, little paths, rises, a creek. As we explore, one of the boys - he looks like Wil Wheaton - is telling us about this movie he was in, that this reminds him of. He'd been knocked out or something, and was face up floating in the creek as it went under a (culvert? is that right?), and leaves & vines floated over him and tangled around his throat as he went under, and inside the culvert he woke up, choking. As he tells this, we all see it, as if in flashback, from overhead. He comes out the other side pulling the vines from his neck, struggling to survive. Very dramatic. He likes to tell us about his exploits. We come out of the woods and there's a building here, we go into it - it's a place we're familiar with but don't go into much. [It could be a library - there are aisles of some kind, very high, maybe floor-to-ceiling stacks, so that you can wander around in them.] We're looking around, together and separately, it's dim (the place is not open), and spooky enough to be fun. [Some event happens, but apparently not onstage, to produce the next bit.] The others are making their way toward the other exit, and I'm hanging back a bit, still exploring, and as I turn a corner I see something startling - the other boy is standing in one of the aisles behind our group [though actually he's looking like a man in a suit] . He stands still, looking away from me, and seems quite grim. There's something wrong here. Moving around quietly and carefully, I see more of them - replicas of my friend - and also some others. I realize that what must have happened is [this event I mentioned] and there are duplicates being created - but they're all replicas of the dark side of this person, none of the nice parts. This is very alarming. We've got to get out of here - I get back to the others as fast as I can and tell them, and we go out - I think if we get him out this thing that's happening will stop. We come out to a part of the park that's sculptured and open, a walkway and water running through a man-made concrete bed alongside, flower beds, etc. It's sunny out. [Out here, there's something about somebody - the boy? being in the water, but it's gone.]"
"390"	"(6/27/92)"	"I'm with my father - a priest - in his office in a church (or some such place), a nice old building, lots of dark wood and heavy furniture. I work with him, and we're getting ready to leave for another church, not far away, even older. [Scene changes.] The new place looks medieval, and we're in a dim stone room with lamps. There's a woman here, must be some kind of administrator, here to work with us, getting things organized. She's got on this fabulous headdress, it's somewhat Slavic in shape, hard side pieces that extend round to the back and continue in a long sort of tail. It's red, with heavy beading, wonderful. I tell her I like it, and she agrees, she just had to have it, got it just recently (at a fair or something). She's blonde, rather fleshy, friendly but not especially jolly. My father is somewhat like Andy Griffith... We are going to see my brother in the hospital [he's not My brother] . It's quite a complicated place, high security - not for casual patients, these are also psychiatric patients, and convicts. My brother did something, and he's been here for treatment. They've put us in this room that you wait in off the elevator. There's nothing here but some lounge-type furniture, and nobody tells us anything. Sometimes we hear announcements over a loudspeaker. My father goes away to do something - we've been waiting a long time and we're getting impatient. I wait longer and longer, and finally pick up the wall phone and start to ask them to investigate. But just then my brother is brought in. We hug and kiss, it's very emotional, he's very lonely. He looks okay, not great, but getting better, but so sad. He keeps kissing and touching me, and I'm a little uncomfortable with it - I wonder if not being around women for so long he's also wanting to touch me just because I'm a woman."
"391"	"(6/30/92)"	"I'm on my way somewhere, driving a car with a female passenger - she's not a friend, and I'm thinking she's not comfortable with my driving - this road has a lot of curves and the lanes aren't marked (there's no paving, though it's good and solid, and smooth - and it's through town, sorta like Oak town), and possibly I'm too close to the wall sometimes - there's a wall median divider, and we're driving on the left of it. I'm just waiting for her to bitch about it, but trying to stay out so she won't get nervous. I'm also looking around at the cute little houses that line the road, and thinking it would be nice to live in one of them - there's a grocery store right down the street, very convenient, there are lots of nice things about it - but it is a very busy street, hmm, why would I be thinking about that anyway? Not my kind of place... Later, I'm at a going-away party for a fellow employee, in a restaurant-bar. It's fairly dark, and there aren't many people I know here, and I don't feel like mingling much. I'm sitting at the bar looking at a magazine. There's an article in series about this young man who's had a number of turns in his life. The first piece is headed, ""Jail 1"", and chronicles what led up to him doing something that he went to prison for and how that affected him. The text goes down the left half of the page, picture on the right. He's nice-looking, dark hair, sort of a country-boy type, but apparently a very nice guy who made a few mistakes. The next piece, ""Jail 2"", comes after another article or 2, and tells the next story, and then the 3rd piece tells about him having a sex change. There are pictures here, too, but also there's a TV nearby - must be up behind the bar because I'm looking up - and there's her, and her girlfriend on TV, probably videotape. There's a closeup, and you can see it's him and all, and I'm thinking he doesn't make a very good-looking woman. Oh, well. There's a woman sitting next to me, middleaged, she's looking over my shoulder and making the occasional lame remark like, ""Why would anybody do such a thing?"" I decide it's time to mosey on off, and take a few steps toward the door, when I'm grabbed by this cheerful young woman with somebody else in tow, she says, ""How are you? You really look good, come with me"", dah dah dah. I think she must be somewhat drunk, as a number of people are getting. She grabs my waist and tugs me over to a seated group and proceeds to chat with them too - ""Look who I found!"" - the thing is, I don't know these people. I think she doesn't realize that, and the others must assume she does. Oh my. I'm trying to think of a way to extricate myself."
"392"	"(7/1/92)"	"I'm trying to get a truck to start; I'm at a small parking lot by the side of a dirt road, with a short open fence. There are some other people around, none of them are helping me. I need to push it to get it to start, but there's a slight upgrade in the road and I think I'm stuck. I wish somebody would come along and push it for me - it would take a truck, I'm picturing somebody in a U-Haul, rented, maybe they'd think they shouldn't do it. I'm in the Philippines, Manila; on some kind of business trip, but Dad & my stepmother live here and I wonder if I should go visit them. Right now I'm out wandering, sort of sightseeing. There's not much to see, around here anyway - I'm staying in an area near the airport (or train station) and there's mostly hotels and American-style restaurants, so I'm looking for real Filipino stuff. I've been with some other people but they've taken the bus back to the hotel, they weren't keen on this area, it's not exactly nice. I'm concerned myself - I keep my eyes open for dangerous-looking people. I'm thinking about something to eat, and there are food places around, not American-style, which sounds interesting. I go up to the counter of one stand and talk to the man there, looking at his menu. He's pretty nice to me, we talk about the area and he explains some things on the menu, I start to order something, and suddenly realize I don't have any cash on me. Can he take traveller's checks? He says yes, but by now I decide I'd better go back to the hotel - I'm not sure about this food, don't know if it would agree with me. While we're talking, though, the bus has come through the area - right off the street, yet - and gone. I'll have a wait. I go along, past some office buildings, and run into a disturbance. A lot of people are running away from something, and there's some shouting and sirens - I learn that there's a huge fire just on the other side of this block, behind these buildings. I figure I'd better get away too, so I turn and go, noticing the smoke roiling up behind the building, and the tops of flames, or flickering firelight. I can see, through gaps between buildings, the vehicles and people moving over there - there's music coming from over there, too, and I recognize the tune from a network news show. They must have a crew there. Good grief. Must be some fire to have all these news people there. I go on, not far away, to Dad & My stepmother's house. I knock, and they answer - surprised to see me, but only because it's unexpected. I go in and chat away, about the fire and the news people - I mention the music - I follow Dad down the hall into the den. There's a tired-looking orange square-cushioned couch. I ask if I can stay the night; I don't think I'll be able to get back with all the commotion. They say okay, why not? I figure the couch won't be all that comfortable, but what the hell. (Maybe I should call the hotel and tell them I won't be using the room tonight, and they won't charge me for it - but no, my luggage is still there, never mind.)"
"393"	"(7/4/92)"	"I run this ""castle"" sort of place. I've got a problem with this guy - a sort of wizard - who wants to take over, I've heard of his plot with another guy, and I'm sort of at a loss right now. I'm looking for Michael Keaton, who's staying here, I like him a lot and he helps me do things, he's very clever, though elusive when it comes to a relationship. I don't really know where I stand with him. I go down where he stays but he's not there. I'm quite frustrated, I need his advice. I see other people going about their business, and I wonder if they know how confused I am, and how they think of me as an administrator. Somewhere I find this note. It's from the housekeeper, she's a nice round ruddy-cheeked woman - she says that she didn't want to tell tales, but somebody is skimming off something and pocketing the proceeds, and she thought I should know. Well, I'm glad she wrote me this note, but it's a couple of years old. It must have been lost all this time. Still, I'll do some investigating. While I'm reading this, I'm eating an ice-cream cone (it's a pretty big scoop on a little bitty cone) and trying to climb a wall. I need to haul myself over the top, and I'm hesitant to do it with the ice-cream cone. After a couple of false starts I do it. It's okay. I go on to cross this sort of pond thing next to some bleacher seats (concrete or stone, I think), and finally see Michael across the way, going the opposite direction. I call to him, saying I need to see him. It's taken him some effort (I think magic was involved) to get where he is without getting wet, and he's not too keen on coming back across, but he does - partly from friendship, but also because I am in charge. I tell him I need his help, he says okay."
"394"	"(7/21/92)"	"I'm with a group of men and women - 3 or 4 of each, all middleaged or older - and we've just come from some seminar or something, it's late, and we're visiting at the house that one of the women - her name is Louise or maybe Betty - lives in, a very nice, small, comfortable house, she's been here for many years, I think she's a widow. We're all very friendly, we're having a good time together. Except for Rita - she's unhappy [for some reason I've forgotten - might have an element of jealousy] with Louise/Betty and decides she'd better leave. I walk with her through the kitchen to the front door, feeling awkward, wishing I could help. She walks on out to her car - I think one or more of the men came with us, and I let them go on ahead back to the living room. I hang back in the hallway - it's rather cluttered, more like a back hallway than a front hallway, but it does lead to the street. Near the door to the kitchen, I notice a folded note on the floor, and I pick it up. Rita must have dropped it. I open it and glance at it; it seems to be for Louise/Betty - I wonder if it's about their problem. I think maybe I ought to give it to Louise/Betty, but then Rita hadn't done it herself, maybe that would be wrong. I go back through the kitchen and decide I'd better get rid of it. I wad it up in my hand as unobtrusively as I can - I could be seen from the living room if anyone was looking this way - and casually toss it in the trash can that's in an open pantry or alcove right before the door, just as I go on through."
"395"	"(7/22/92)"	"I'm visiting Karen, who's at home with her little boy (who is about 2 instead of a baby). Her husband comes in unexpectedly - he is a very unpleasant man, and Karen is very uncomfortable - you could say she even looks scared, and it's apparently because I'm there - she's not supposed to have visitors, it seems, and he is very disapproving. I feel intimidated myself, and figure I'd better go. Outside, I see some of Peter's sculpture - he's an artist - at the entrance to the house. One of them, on the left, is a sort of spire, or extremely large spike. It's metal, dark, pointed at the top, wider at the bottom, and there's something at the bottom that looks like a small dog lying on its back with its head away from me and its feet up, almost as if it were impaled on the spike. Another, smaller dog, a puppy, is standing in front of it (and the not dissimilar piece next to it), barking. This whole thing is up on a ledge or platform almost at eye level. As I look at the first piece, I am more and more disconcerted - it really does look real - it couldn't be, could it? I stare at it, fascinated. Then suddenly it moves, kicks its back legs up as if it was trying to pull free, to get up. It is real! Oh hell. Oh, hell. I don't want to believe this. He's actually impaled a dog on this thing, because he thinks it's art. Oh, hell. It goes through my mind to rescue it, but how in the world could I possibly do anything that would help? I know it must be bleeding to death, why in the world is it still alive anyway? I don't want to look around at the other side, on my right, that's been obscured by the puppy - but I do, and sure enough, yes, there's blood gushing out from its side, hell, there's nothing I can do, I've got to get away from here. [Either I go back in and tell Karen about this, Peter being gone again, and she decides to come with me, or on my way to the car she catches up, with her little boy, knowing she has to get away herself, and protect her child from this man, who's been getting increasingly more dangerous.]"
"396"	"(7/28/92)"	"I'm going to the toilet in this open space - the building is where I work, I think - the toilet is located at the end of a wall between two areas, and faces some seats. There's a couple of women sitting there, and there's a man sitting up on the wall - I think in an opening of some sort, he sits up there to oversee whatever goes on below, like a lifeguard. He's chatting with the women some. I've got a gas problem, and am very uncomfortable. I sit and try to let it out very slowly and not make any noise, but it takes a long time and they're noticing and snickering. There's also a man in the space behind me, and he notices too, but he's trying to be polite and not look. The guy on the perch says something aloud to the women, and I really feel angry and humiliated. I glare up at him, and say ""Fuck you"" - muttering, not wanting to start an argument. But he gets angry, jumps up and climbs down. He comes over to me on the toilet, waggles his fingers and says, ""Come with me."" He's playing offended, and apparently means to turn me in for being insolent or insubordinate. I get up and walk with him, saying, ""I wonder if you've really thought about this."" I'm thinking, even if he reports me to somebody, I've got a very good case here, he's the one who ridiculed me, in front of others - even the man behind me was laughing. I'm picturing myself defending in front of somebody, and them realizing what a jerk he is, and they'll probably turn on him. I ask him where we're going, and he says, ""Oh, about 10 floors up"" - he's very supercilious. I realize he means to report me to the director. Oh, please. This is out of hand. I stop, and sharply say, ""Look here, you stop - I am not going to be taken to the principal's office like some schoolgirl. This is ridiculous."""
"397"	"(7/29/92)"	"I am in a garage, having my car worked on - something to do with the wheels, or rotating the tires. I'm chatting with the mechanics, I've seen them before, though not to work on my car, I think. We're casual friends, and this is a friendly sort of little neighborhood garage. The burlier guy says it'll be $89.95 to do the work. I roll my eyes and say, fine, ok, at least it isn't any more than that, all the other work I've had done lately has been a lot more, this isn't so bad. I'm feeling pretty lively, strutting around in my new black motorcycle boots and jeans. The other mechanic is noticing, and points at my boots to the other one, a sort of elbow-in-the-ribs look. I think I look spiffy."
"398"	"(8/2/92)"	"I am playing (sort of) with a Komodo dragon, a baby. We're in the living room or hallway of a house, near the stairs, and I'm sitting on the floor. It's a cute little thing, and I'm patting it, trying not to get it too excited, because if you get too involved with them, and especially when you try to get away or stop playing, they may bite - and their bite is poisonous. It really wants to stay close, though, and I'd like to get away, but it crawls around to my back and parks there, curling up to take a nap. If I get up, I'm afraid I'll disturb it, and it'll snap at me in reflex. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do. [As I wake up, I'm imagining what it would be like if I did disturb it, and had to fight it off. I envision whirling around and pulling back to keep away, and feeling frantic. This is not what I meant to do - I'm losing control here.]"
"399"	"(8/3/92)"	"I'm in a sort of attic, a partially finished loft, where there are some old things stored, especially childrens' things - it all looks like the turn of the century or perhaps up to the 20's - I'm looking for something, and I'm setting up some books that have fallen over. While I'm at it, I'm sorting them for size, just because, why not? I'm near the ladder down to the next floor, and someone down there (a man) is speaking to me, wanting to know if I need any help - he's concerned about me being up here alone, wants me to be careful on that ladder. I'm quite all right, everything's just fine."
"400"	"(8/4/92)"	"I'm in a car with a man. He's driving, and says, will you take over for me for a little while? He lets go of the wheel, and I take it; it seems he wants to look at something or think about something. But he's still in the driver's seat. How am I supposed to drive - I ask him - if he's still got the pedals?"
"401"	"(8/5/92)"	"A group of us are looking at this house we want to rent. It certainly looks good, just my sort of place - old, well furnished, great shape - nice stuff, good wood furniture. We look at the living room and a couple of bedrooms. I'm wondering where the 3rd bedroom can be - I guess we may have to make do somehow, but really however good it looks, it may just be too small for us. But then the rental agent takes us through another door to a hallway, and here's other rooms - actually quite a number of them, it turns out - this place is much bigger than we thought, too big really, but at this price, my word, this is too good to be true - I love this house, it's just gorgeous."
"402"	"(8/6/92)"	"I'm in Africa with a group [probably for a Training - similar premise] , and we're at the end of what we're doing. I'm going on to another city in a couple of days on my own, for a festival, it's going to be lots of fun. A couple of us are going off on an errand in a taxi, we're very jolly, and there's another man sharing. He's got some money in his hand, and he gives it to me, saying something about a nice thing happening to him, and somebody else should share. I'm flabbergasted, but I take it, oh yes, very grateful. It's a sort of unkempt handful of bills, various denominations, and I have an idea it may add up to quite a lot. Wow. This is very disconcerting. I wonder if I can really keep it, or should I give to the Training? Is that expected of me? But he just gave it to me - I figure it can be all mine. I don't count it while the man is here, that would be impolite... We go on to our destination and back, then I count it. It's not as much as I'd thought - not hundreds - but still it'll do for helping me with some new clothes for my excursion. I'm telling a friend about it back at the Training, when I realize - whoops! I'm going in only two days! How did it get so close? How am I going to get ready in time? I've got lots of arrangements to make! [The next part is sort of mixed up with a movie I may be watching.] In the other city, I'm staying in an apartment that used to be something else, maybe a stablehouse or something. It's going to be renovated later, and fixed up nice. I'm telling someone else about this, saying, ""Just think about how this will look - won't it be nice?"" I've got a takeout meal - probably Indian, it's soupy, like a curry, and I'm dumping it out on a plate. It's got meat in it, I'd forgotten about that - but oh, never mind, I can just pull the pieces out. There's even a big piece of bacon, and I think to myself, they just can't help themselves, have to put bacon in everything, don't they? (Meaning the English.) This woman who's been staying here for a long time, with her sister I think, is due to go home soon. She's dressed rather Victorian, high-necked white blouse, long skirt, high-button shoes, hair up in a big roll. Something's going on in the area that a man is responsible for, and there's going to be an election. She decides to stay and run for office so she can oppose him. (This is a movie, I think.)"
"403"	"(8/19/92)"	"I'm with Dr Who [Tom Baker] and a boy; we're in a small place with some other people, and the Doctor is doing an experiment that will demonstrate something, or help something, and we're not sure it's done yet. The boy has a tube of some kind in his stomach - it's in a metal shaft-fixture, and I'd say the tube itself is at least a foot long - part of it goes up inside of him, and the whole thing folds up so it doesn't stick out. The experiment is with something inside the tube, and you have to break it to get it out. Dr Who holds the fixture and carefully breaks the glass. I have to help him get the glass shards out - I scoop them up gently with both hands, and he holds his other hand out and I put the broken bits in it; then he throws them away. Shortly I've picked the bits from around the thing inside, and he takes that out to examine it. I think the results are inconclusive. The boy wants to go home, he's not willing to wait any longer, and even though we're not done, he goes. [I don't know how he gets there, but we are like the Doctor's other companions, he lives somewhere away from wherever we are now - probably on another planet. Wherever that is, he knows how to go there and does.] The Doctor is concerned because of the broken bits of the glass tube left in the boy's stomach. So we go after him. Before we get there, I can see the scene: He arrives in his family's house - his mother is there, she's got on a long skirt and a long-sleeved blouse, and an apron - her hair is up in a bun. She's nice, youngish, busy. Also he has a baby sister, she's very lively, running around, into everything, quite cute, blond, pink cheeks. The room makes me think it's almost a log cabin, on the rustic side, the room I see has got hardly any furniture in it. His mother barely greets him at all - you'd think she didn't even know he was gone. She leaves him to watch the baby - who needs a lot of watching - and goes into another room. [We arrive, and I don't know what brings us to the next scene, but we've all gone somewhere else and he's needing to call home before we leave where we are now - all part of our adventure.] We're at this public telephone, which also has other functions - perhaps it's also an ATM - and it has a different setup from your usual telephone keypad. The face is silver and the buttons are concave like real public phones, though. He's given me the number, and I'm trying to do it, but we're losing the light and I can't see the numbers, and I keep punching the wrong ones because they're in the wrong places. I'm trying to concentrate very hard - I get the number I need straight, and then try to focus on the numbers on the keypad and get them clear before pressing, and finally I get all but the last one and then I've got it, just right, and still when I get my finger up there I hit the wrong one because my finger made me lose my focus. I'm very frustrated and anxious. We've got to get away from here, time is passing. It's almost too dark to see now."
"404"	"(8/20/92)"	"I'm in (my?) apartment, upstairs, at the end of a walkway with an open railing - either I'm just moving in or out, or we're doing a big spring cleaning - me and my roommate. The door is standing open, it's nice outside, bright sunshine. I step out the door briefly and see two guys at the end of the walkway, facing away from me - one's leaning on the rail, but one's got Alleycat in a jar - it's a great big round jar with a huge mouth, and he had just crawled in there out of curiosity, as cats do. (I may have put the cork in myself - playing with him.) I don't know how this guy got Alleycat, but I'm scared and worried - I know (somehow) that they're bad guys, and they're planning to break in here and rob us. I could just close the door - I duck back inside - but I've got to be careful of Alleycat. I don't want him to get hurt. Actually it might be okay if he just dropped the jar - it would probably break, and then Alleycat could run off - but that would be a gamble, and he might get hurt. I'd better get the bad guy to put him down. I'm not sure what I should do, but I've got to do something; I'm angry, too, and I want to fight... I do something to attract their attention, and they come in after us. [I think my roommate has been inside the whole time and is acting with me.] I grab a stick - a broomstick maybe, about that size, and start fighting with the one that had Alleycat. [I don't know what's happened to him.] I try to swing at him, but it seems like I'm just not hitting very hard - I'm not making much of a dent (no pun intended). I'm getting frustrated and feeling a little desperate. Why can't I do anything here? I really want to at least hold my own, but I seem to be too weak."
"405"	"(8/30/92)"	"I'm with a group of people, particularly including teenage kids, sheltering under some big ledge sort of thing while something is happening in the sky - it's all filled with rolling dark clouds, there are funny lights. (I don't know what's going on or what might happen, but it's big and ominous.) Something changes in one part of the sky -it looks like a shape is forming, and the colors are changing, reds and yellows. I tell the others to look at it. We're getting frightened. There's a girl next to me, she's about 14 I guess, and she says something like, ""What are we going to do?"" I turn to her and say it's going to be all right, I'm sure we'll get out of this okay. She looks dubious, looks around her and starts talking to her friends. I think she doesn't trust me. I'm a little disappointed. (Later) I'm on a dark street in a little parking space just next to the curb, standing outside and near the car, with somebody else, a man, a friend. (We've been with some others previously - possibly the group from the other dream.) He needs to go somewhere for a little while to take care of something, he should be back soon. Meanwhile I'll wait, but it's not a very nice neighborhood and it looks deserted, the street looks slick as if it had rained, and the street light glares down yellow... Down at the other end of this space, at the corner, a group of boys have collected, all black, they may be a gang, and they're harassing a boy that I know -he's black too, maybe 12 or 13, and he's part of something we do (maybe the previous group, maybe we do something with a recreation center). Nice kid. The others are trying to intimidate him, they're not hostile yet. I can catch some of their words, and one or two of them sound like they're about me. Somebody points my direction. Now I'm wondering if they're talking about doing something to me. Oh, dear. I start to speculate about getting in the car and driving off. I'm worried and anxious. Later: I'm at the library, at a row of shelving, checking through some things. Everyone's attention is directed forward, as if somebody's teaching a class or giving a talk at the front of the room. (And maybe so.) I find a group of cards, look through them, and find mixed in there's some [paper library card applications] /wedding invitations for Geoffrey's wedding. They've got names on them for people I recognize, and it's very stupid for them to be mixed in here. Who did this? (Me, I wonder? - I don't think so.) Well, hell; now what? I should do something about them - call the people up, I guess. I know at least one of them's out of town. I'd better go do that. I turn around and see the next shelf (sorting shelves) is still not sorted completely yet. I'd better do that right quick. I stick my arm out to put the ""invitations"" down and knock over a lot of books, though I catch some before they go all over. Oh, great. Well, I'll fix it. VK comes over and tells me to let (somebody) do this, he'll be just fine, we need to let him. (This guy isn't visible, but I picture him in my mind's eye as Benny on ""L.A. Law"". He's slow but quite competent, and new here at the library, we're all learning what he can do.) I tell VK about the ""invitations"" and go off to deal with them."
"406"	"(9/2/92)"	"Debbie Reynolds is doing a musical (maybe ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" at this local theater, with our amateur theater group, and I'm at a rehearsal. I'm helping out in the back, I think, and I've finished for now. But I'm just looking at what they're doing on the stage, trying to get a scene right, and Debbie (who's directing) tells me to come forward and deliver a line. (Actually, I and a couple of other people were just crossing the stage to leave when she noticed us.) She's trying to get something across to the cast and it isn't coming. So they do the bit and I say my line a couple-three times, and that's okay. I go on... I'm taking this light-blue Volkswagen Beetle that's borrowed off this ledge, somewhat like a loading dock. But there are cars parked all around it except one spot on the far side, and I'll have to lower it off the edge. It's not too hard, but I have to be careful not to drop it. I can let it down one end at a time - it has a sort of pole linking the front end and the back end, and it's jointed, so I can guide it. I get it down okay. Next I'm at Gail's house with some women, toward the end of a visit. I'm in the kitchen with her, and there's a bag of some new kind of croutons, they have different kinds of bread - some light, some dark, they'e very good. (One of us is telling the other that she's just discovered these, try them, they're really good.) Also Gail shows me a Sunday comic that she saved for me, it's funny. I'm ready to leave, though, and I go on. There's also a young man here, he's interesting-looking, but I don't get to know much about him - I'm shying away.I go on outside, and have a look at this drain-plug sort of thing. It's a brass-colored metal fixture in a shallow hole in the front walk, with a little hole in the middle of it. There's supposed to be something plugging up that hole, and earlier I poured some white glue into it to help seal it up. Now I'm examining it, picking at the rounded top to see if it's dried, and pour some more glue in from a large bottle I've taken from the house. Satisfied that it'll dry properly to fill up the space, I take the glue back into the house to just return it and go. Inside, I see the young man just inside the next-room doorway, and put the bottle in his hands, saying something like, ""Will you put this back, please?"" As I'm turning toward the door again, he moans something about how he's going to die and people just use him to fetch and do errands. I turn back to look - he is the very picture of a whiner. I listen to him for a while, and we go into the next room to talk. As he handles the glue bottle, I realize he's blind. Golly. I'm interested and sympathetic, but I realize he needs somebody to help him just feel like a normal person. Apparently he does have other illnesses or disabilities, but he's not really (or necessarily) going to die - he's just being dramatic. He lays on the floor, and while we're still talking, I sit on his back - gently, carefully. I think he could use some massage to his poor tired body, and I adjust a bit - he doesn't protest - and then rock back and forth to give pressure on his back muscles."
"407"	"(9/5/920)"	"I'm walking out sort of in the country, or the edge of town, intending to get somewhere but seeing all nice things around - the sky, trees, all that, feeling quite perky. I'm taking a different street because it's interesting. It gets very steep - I'm thinking while climbing up it about a situation in an earlier part of the dream, where the exercise group I work out with wants to split up. Part of us are gonna stay where we are, and part move out north somewhere to the edge of town, which will include Gail's - I'm really torn whether I want to go out there with them or stay where I am, which is a great deal more convenient - where I'm used to. They're gonna expect me to make a decision. The sidewalk starts out going by something like a hotel - a big single building, very nicely done, landscaping, set back from the road a bit - nothing on the other side of the street, but there's a regular sidewalk - I pass that up, walking by some houses - it gets steeper & steeper, to the point where I'm just climbing, using my hands even. I guess I might be able to straighten up - I rather doubt it. I'm passing by trees, all that. I keep thinking I'm gonna get to the top - I could turn around & go back of course - I do want to come to a stopping point. When I've gotten up there, there's a house, & I go inside, apparently because I'm supposed to or because it's normal to, but something has changed completely. I see a woman (I have turned into a male policeman, who's married to or was married to the woman who lives here - I used to live here too. There's some people in the front of the house who don't know me and have been inquiring why I want to see her - whether it's ok or not. But I do go back and talk to her, particularly about a TV set and whether or not I should keep it or she should. It's rather awkward but it shouldn't be - it doesn't need to be, we've agreed on what we were gonna do, and I'm not gonna try to persuade her to do anything else. Previously something to do with that exercise class - I believe just watching it - I don't know whether I've been participating with this one or not. The one I'm seeing is a very large group of women rehearsing some kind of dance routine. I suppose it must be an exercise routine because that's what they're there for but it really is, as much as anything, a dance routine. It's rather complicated - they've just run through the last few bits, finished up with a difficult maneuver, it ends up in a kind of lunge-squat, and I'm thinking that would be very hard for me. They decide - somebody decides - they should they should vote on it, whether or not to keep this piece in the routine or not, because it is rather difficult. They decide as a majority that they will keep it in, but I can see that some part of the group thinks its too difficult (or looks as though they think it is). They're divided - there're 2 groups, one in the front, and a kind of aisle, and I don't know if they divided up intentionally that way, or why there's a partition, but there just is."
"408"	"(10/1/92)"	"I'm downtown at the library - they're having a birthday party for me, it seems like, and we're just finishing up - people are milling around chatting with each other. There's sweets all over the place and I have just met this young man - he's probably in his 20's, somewhat good-looking, I like him, he's fun - reminds me a good bit of Russ. He's wanting to know a good place to go and eat lunch. Someone has suggested to him a restaurant just outside of downtown (which I don't hear named but it appears they're talking about the Dixie) and he needs to know how to get there. I start to tell him only I'm not doing too well at it verbally, so I want a map. I look around and what I find is some sketchy little map that shows you downtown but not the individual streets. I despair of showing him on that - we're just not getting very far. I decide I'd better find a Mapsco - can't find the one that's supposed to be around here, so I go and get the one in my car. People are around; some are taking home their leftovers and some handing them to me, so I've got like a box with leftover cookies in it, and bits of pie and cake and whatnot. We're still having a conversation along the way and I'm thinking I quite like him - I've been in this situation before, where here's a nice young man, that I might actually be flirting with and want to have a relationship with - if I was (a) younger and (b) slimmer, and surprised that he's being as chatty as he is, and wondering if he does have something on his mind - which would surprise me, but you know the behavior is there. And he's trying to have a conversation with me while other people are trying to chat with me as well and we meet them on the way out. Now, the car is in a garage in the back yard - of course the library has no back yard, but now they do, and it's sunny outside. There's hedges all around - the situation is very much like a Sunday after church in summer. So: I am needing to get somewhere eventually, but also wanting to talk to this guy. There's an appointment I need to get to - I get in the car & fetch out the Mapsco and put the stuff I'm carrying on the dashboard. I start to show him where it is - he's looking a bit impatient with me, and finally in a kind of frustration he's yanking me aside and saying, ""Look, I want to sleep with you"" - which was kind of abrupt but, well, gets the point across - and then I'm astonished, of course, & have no idea what to say to him. So we go back inside and talk some more sitting on the floor in front of some chairs. There's other people sort of casually about - it's more like somebody's living room now, and there's a book under the chair I'm sitting in front of and I can see it suddenly. I realize it's something I had been missing and needed to take with me wherever it is that I'm going. So I do - I decide that it's time I went, so I get my book and my other stuff & go on. I'm going to a psychotherapist's office I guess - she seems to be a psychotherapist in the way she behaves (I'm not sure that the whole situation is that way) and I am like half an hour late or more, and she's kind of reluctant to even see me because after all I've barely got time to even get started before she's got another client - but I sit there and we talk anyway. I seem to have a problem - a specific problem that needs addressing - it's hard to say whether it's serious or not from this vantage point - but she is certainly taking it seriously, and I seem not to be taking it seriously since after all, I'm this late."
"409"	"(11/1/92)"	"I'm in a house with Gail - I don't know if it's her house or not. I've been doing something with some others & need to go home - it's not that we've been all together doing whatever it is, but I have been doing whatever I'm supposed to be doing, on my own, involving moving around the house. Gail is working somewhere in another part of the house & I'm taking my leave, basically - I've gone through the kitchen & looked in the refrigerator to see if there's anything to munch on particularly, to take along for the ride. There's nothing - I'm disappointed and I'm going on to get my gear in another room. So I do that, and on the way back take a turn through the kitchen again & lo and behold there's some cookies now, nice looking ones - storebought but that's okay - so I munch on one and, grabbing a few others & holding them in my hand, I go on. I run into some of the other people, including Gail, who is sitting I think at a computer & working. I'm hiding the cookies - I don't want them to see that I've taken them without permission & I've got them down at my side in my hand - and occasionally when I have to move my hand I squish it a little bit & I'm afraid I'm squashing the cookies but that is how it is, I guess. On my way past where Gail is sitting I see that she has some other cookies too, of her own, on a tray - they're very nice looking as a matter of fact, these look homemade, some of them have chocolate on them, I think - and I wish that I'd been around to get some of those. But that's sad, and I go on. The house apparently leads into a hardware store because I am in a hardware store next, and I haven't been outside and walked into it. It's very close; there's stuff everywhere, even overhead, sort of a general-store look to it - there's more than one room, and there's nobody about -I know the store's run by a family, there's a number of them - and I wonder if they're closed, which would be very strange. I pass by the front door and see that there's a hasp on it, and it's moved over but there isn't any padlock and I'm most concerned about that - how in the world could it be that there's nobody here and they're closed but they haven't locked the door? It's most disconcerting, and I decide I'd better call the police. I go a little way beyond the front door and see that I can see in the mirror if there's somebody at the front, and indeed there is. There's a mirror rigged so you can see whoever's just outside the front door. There's a young woman, blond I think - she's got on a sort of business suit - looks like a nice person. She opens the door and comes in - I can see her standing in the entry - I move forward a little bit and make a casual remark - as least it sounded casual to me, about how, ""Oh, I didn't realize that anyone was coming in - I wanted to see if it was possible to get in the front door."" She looks rather startled and concerned - looks around and leaves. I hadn't realized she couldn't see me - the entry is a very close place too, kind of cave-like, and this mirror's not flat against the wall like I thought it was, I have to look for it. I myself am beyond the wall into the next room and I can see into the entry to that room; there's no door to shut, and the mirror I'm seeing is in a kind of cleft or recess in the wall, which is on the craggy side, and it's placed at just such an angle that you can see what you need to see - for instance, somebody coming in the front door, but they can't see you. They can't see the mirror either. So she's gone, and at this time the proprietor shows up, and his family, and it turns out that what's been going on is they've been preparing for a family celebration of some kind. They've gone off to get things from the back - food and whatnot - and they have left the store open, but they didn't figure they'd be gone any length of time. Now I'm feeling kind of thwarted - here I was going to be a hero - I had been telling them, ""Well, yes, I saved your store from being robbed"" maybe, or something, but I'm no longer needed now. Before I go I figure I will go into this side room and do a kind of meditation ritual which involves spreading a sort of blanket (or maybe it's a robe of some kind) and setting a little altar sort of thing, and I'm starting to do that. But the owner is also setting up something in this room - it might be a barbecue pit or something like that - he and one of his sons maybe or another relative, are bustling around carrying things and setting them up in the middle and he's pretty oblivious to me. I guess that I could be going on doing what I'm doing for all of him, but I'm definitely uncomfortable carrying on with it - I think that I might, I guess, but I realize there's no way I can meditate with this going on. So I pack up my stuff and I'm thinking maybe I'll do it at home - not the best way to do it but I'll do it. Now right after this (or between the house and the hardware store, but I think it's after) I stop by a place where there are people I know (I don't think it's the hardware store family but it might be) and there is a young girl that's a friend of mine - she has bought a puzzle game that she's wanting everybody to do and before I go she wants me to put a piece of the puzzle in - she hands me one and says, ""There ya go - go ahead - you put this one in, this is where we are!"" and she shows me the picture of how it's supposed to look. I figure where it's supposed to go and I put it in and then I grab another one and put it in, and suddenly of course I've got jigsaw-puzzle fever. My piece looked like a corner - like land on a map next to water, but it was definitely a right angle [but?] that was supposed to be where we are - and I can see a piece that looks like a part of New England - like New Jersey or Maine or something like that, maybe New York, and I'm thinking, okay, this is a map of New England. But it's not really and as I keep putting things together bit by bit it turns out that it's not just that but it's the whole United States - how did I miss that? That's really strange. I've got the thing mostly put together, and I realize - and my friend does too - that if I keep on going like this, her family's not going to have any parts to put into it, and it's embarrassing. But at the same time I want to finish it, oh, just got a few more pieces! But the better part of valor is to take it all apart and let the family do it - someone comes in, a man who is familiar but I don't know who he is now, maybe he's an actor or some other personality, don't think somebody I really know, I think he's the dad here, and he makes some joke about taking it all apart because he doesn't know why I put it all together in the first place. So I pull all the pieces apart and put them back in the box. Now, there's also a scene from a time before the house with Gail in it, I think - it seems to be gone - I am in another house with another group of people and there's a big metal shelving unit with things on it that falls over and falls right on a glass-topped coffee table. I can see it start to go and I realize it's going to break the thing to smithereens if it lands there, but there isn't anything that I can do about it while it slowly keels over and goes kablam. There's pieces of glass everywhere and everybody's gonna have to help clean it up and we're gonna have to be careful, of course, not to get cut by the glass."
"410"	"(12/7/92)"	"I am some sort of clerk, perhaps a messenger [...?] and I have files or some kind of papers to take to Bob Costas who is some kind of elected official. He is in some kind of house or building some litttle distance away from where I am. It's a very nice old building - the way you'd like old buildings or offices to be - has that dark wood, long hallways, heavy doors, molding, all that. I go through on the first floor - I know people in here - and I know Bob too, not very well, especially - certainly well enough to drop in on him, and exchange greetings and whatnot, when I bring these papers. But today he's sick - maybe he has the flu, he's very sick indeed and there's a bed in there - the building may not always have been a government building in the first place, but in any case there's a little room that he's in that has a bed in it - there's nothing at all unusual about that, because after all sometimes even a government official might need to lie down or he might be sick. I pass by that room - I stop and talk to his secretary, who will take the papers and see that they get handled, and she's just telling me that it would be best not to disturb him right now. I go into the hall only a few feet away and sit down in a chair to wait for the papers to get handled. (The next thing I know about) l have left there and I guess I've gone home, but wherever, I've been informed - I think by telephone - that Bob Costas has died. This is a shock and disappointment to everybody - he's really well liked, he's a really nice guy, and I'm thinking particularly of Judy Early - she's a particular friend of his, she and her husband. I'm supposed to see her later myself, and she calls me and she doesn't know that I know yet, and I can hear the sadness in her voice, and she mentions it and I say, ""Yes, I already know - I'm terribly sorry"", so we reschedule our meeting for another time. Chris is also here - I think he just stopped by for a visit and I tell him that I'm gonna go out and do something else. I think I still have some sort of business to take care of. But in any case, where I go next is a kind of amusement place. What I see is a sort of lobby with a hostess-type person in it, and food service, drink service, and waitresses and whatnot - they're in sort of little costumes, the theme is more or less middle European. I don't know what else there is to do, but there's this thing that's not exactly a ride, it's a place where can you walk down on it and be very high up in the air - it's a thrill sort of thing. I decide I'm gonna do this - I've got a drink in my hand as well - not supposed to be dangerous of course, but it's the sort of thing people get nervous about. I'm certainly nervous to some extent - I have a mixture of feelings, where I'm still sad about Bob and wanting to be on my own and kind of reflective, and at the same time I think it would be helpful to be out on this thing, where there could be some other element in my feelings - where I could (?) a kind of stimulus - a bit of external excitement. As I say, I've got a drink of some kind & go to the entrance of the thing, and meet up with Dirk Kirk - he works here, I don't know in what capacity, but I had said I wanted to talk to him, and he comes along. Brenda is somewhere not far behind, but Dirk comes up & we visit for a bit. I am really wanting to carry on an extended conversation but it turns out he can't go out on this thing because he's an employee. Of course he's got stuff to do - I think his job is as usual some sort of less-than-thrilling, less-than-impressive job but he certainly wants to keep it, and there are people who will notice if he's not doing what he's supposed to be doing. He's kind of tentative about spending so much time talking to me already. We exchange a few bits of information - I tell him about Bob and he tells me how things are going with him & Brenda and of course tries to make things very up-and-up, very cheerful, & Brenda comes along with a friend of hers and sorta waits & doesn't say much - an air of vague disapproval - nothing too exotic. I go ahead take my leave of them and go on out to this thing. You sort of step onto this thing very much like a terrace, that goes down gradually - there's a bit of walkway with a wood railing - you can sit on built-in benches - and the thing is, as you walk along, the thing shakes, it feels rickety indeed. Now, everything else that you can see is quite stable, the building it's attached to is quite stable - and the ground is not several stories down as you imagine, there's actually a floor not too far below you, so it seems as if you fell it wouldn't be too drastic. But at the same time the thing continues to go down so what I assume is that the whole structure is going down - [I'm assuming that now, but I didn't in the dream - I didn't know what to expect in the dream] but the place you're standing on, if you're moving, is going to shake with you. If you sit down it's stable again, and that's why I do it. Like I said, I'm wanting to reflect and I'm quite willing to just move out here and sit down for a bit, drink my drink and muse upon things - about the sadness and how people come and go and how your friends can be sad and you can sympathize with 'em, and that's all I do for a while."
"411"	"(12/2/92)"	"I am watching TV early in the morning with my brother - watching Howard Stern. It's a TV version of his regular morning studio radio show, and he is just having discussions with people around in the office and there's a portion where there's barely anybody visible on the screen. My brother and I are occasionally having a conversation (not my real brother, by the way - bears some resemblance to the actor Robert Hayes - younger I suppose) - I'm in school and I think he is too. But for some reason he isn't going today. I'm supposed to go, and the later it gets the more at risk I am of being late. Bonnie is our mother - she's in another room, when the phone rings. I am supposed to be getting ready for school and it occurs to me that I'd better start moving. She comes back and says she has to go to - maybe it's the hospital - there is someone she knows in trouble and she has to go and help out somehow and I am asking if it's somebody I know - [she says a first name I don't remember right now] - she says, ""I have go right now"" - anyhow she's not answering the question. Seems kind of distracted, definitely quite worried - whatever is going on, it's very serious - I keep after her for several tries - [""somebody""] who? - is it the one I know? Do I know this person? ""Can I help?"" obviously is what I mean - and she eventually says, ""No, I don't think you do know her"", and I say, ""Well okay, but I just wanted to know."" She goes (now I'm thinking Bonnie is my grandmother maybe) - meanwhile I go into the bathroom. The object is, I need to get ready for school - I've looked at the clock - or a clock, and discovered it's 10 in the morning - I'm really startled - school starts at 8, and the TV - well, the show goes on all morning, I'm thinking, ""Surely I haven't just sat and stared at the TV this long!"" I look at another clock, and it says 8 o'clock, which is bad enough, but how could the clocks be at 2 different hours? This is terrible! I had better get to school anyhow - this has really got me upset. I've never done anything like this before - certainly I may have been late some places before, but nothing like this, and at school they're gonna think that I've cut or something. This is terrible. But I go into the bathroom and there's stuff, everywhere that I want to use - the bathtub has something in it, some kind of cloth or maybe a shower curtain or something - the sink has corn on the cob in it - not whole pieces, small chunks - and that is just disgusting. (There's something else - I don't know if there's 2 sinks but there's something else I wanted to use that's clogged up with something.) I'mjust outraged and I know that my brother is responsible for at least the sink, because it's his stuff, and I think the bathtub too, and somebody else has left the other stuff and I am wanting to get this fixed up right now. I do not wish to do it myself - it's not my mess. I know I can't ask Bonnie to do it, and my brother - geez - he's a lazy bum himself. So I sort of throw my hands up for a while. Then I realize I can't remember my class schedule. I'm always late, but it seems like I haven't been in school in days and I can't remember what class comes when. This is really weird and disconcerting, and I know that when I get to school I can stop in the principal's office and ask where I'm supposed to be. But this is already just too weird a morning for me to handle already. I'm mad at my brother and even sort of mad at Bonnie, and I just don't know what to make of anything. Outside some people are arriving - I think they're my parents - and some other people, family - and I've gone outside - getting to be on my way to school - and I've stopped to greet them. My brother has for some reason shrunk very small and fallen into a drain hole - not a gutter, it's a round hole in the sidewalk and there's water rushing, rushing, rushing, underneath it. It's kind of as though he shrinks as he falls, really. I have a little vindictive pleasure at seeing him fall in there but at the same time, well, he's my brother, and he's going to get swept away and possibly killed, even, if I let him stay there. But he hangs on to something for a bit and I reach in and grab his legs and then pick him up kind of like a doll with my other hand behind his back and pull him back out again."
"412"	"(8/1/94)"	"I have met a young man who professed to be in love with me. He thinks I am the greatest thing since sliced bread, hugely entertaining, beautiful, enchanting - he can't get enough of me, and wants to be at my side every minute. He wants to give me everything, and has bought me presents, lots of them. There's a big shopping bag with boxes in it, all wrapped. I'm overwhelmed, barely know what to say. He's awfully nice (if a bit over-energetic and bouncy), and nice-looking too. Sandy or reddish hair, on the slender side, jeans and shirt or T-shirt... I do like him a lot, but couldn't say I love him, not yet anyway, this is happening awfully fast. We're in a public place, sort of - open hallways, a wide ""T"" intersection, generally featureless but comfortable, sitting on a wall bench or something. Other people go by sometimes. It's right before Christmas, and a group forms, mostly my family, including my father, and we're exchanging Christmas presents. I'm being given lots of nice things, and my boyfriend is giving me even more stuff; eventually I realize that I haven't even opened the first presents yet, this is just more than I can handle. Overwhelming.I am somewhat infirm. My legs and hips don't work right, I can't bend or walk properly. I think this is part of my attraction for this young man, and it's nice to have so much attention when I feel so shy and inadequate. He helps me get this little vehicle - it's something more like a go-kart than a wheelchair - and I really am grateful for the mobility. But I have somewhere else to be, so I have to leave. He doesn't want me to go, of course, but it's not going to be long - we tear ourselves away from each other. Along the way I am at a little ""antique shop"". It's a kind of open-air thing - cute furniture, figurines, that sort of thing - run by a rather testy dilettante and a friend or two. I'm looking at a little table, and want to see it (or something under it) closer, so I put both hands on it to steady me while I carefully lower myself down to a squat. With my weight partially on this table, it starts to tilt - it turns out to be very unstable, even though it looks sturdy enough. We both nearly crash. A big heavy vase, however, slides forward and off. It falls to the ground, and a round ""ear""-handle piece breaks off of it. At least it didn't smash all to pieces, I figure, though the shop owner is looking quite anxious. She's been watching me anyway, like I was not up to her usual quality of customer anyhow - now she looks as if she's waiting to see if I'll offer to pay for the vase. I think I'd just as soon wait to see if she'll ask me to pay for it, since I don't figure it was my fault it got broken anyway. It wasn't exactly displayed as safely as all that, and I might've gotten hurt myself. I go along. I'm meeting up with the Current Collection staff (including Becky , who's still the manager). I have some writing to do, an article for (some publication - a newsletter or -paper or magazine) on a day in the life of President Clinton. I'm a bit behind, and I'm only just getting started, organizing my thoughts and thinking about how to open it. The Current Collection folks are going on a field trip to the Carrollton Public Library for a conference of some kind, and I decide to join them. We get into a mini-van (Becky's I think) and pull out onto a broad, tree-lined avenue. I'm thinking in quotes for my article, like ""President Clinton's day started out with a drive down this broad, tree-lined avenue (insert name), and..."" something about orange juice and muffins goes through my mind. I have my notebook and pen out, jotting notes. I'm wearing my black wool cape, and I'm sitting in the middle seat of the van, opposite the door so there's no seat next to me. My cape hem is dragging on the floor and I pull it up, discovering that it's heavily coated with dust, yuck. We arrive at Carrollton Public. I've been here before - it's way out in the boonies, and has daycare/preschool facilities as well as library and study areas. This one big place is crawling with rug rats and nice young teacher types in charge, kiddie-colorful playstuff all over. I have my purse and a pillow with me; thinking to put them down while I walk around, I toss them onto this ""chair"" thing - there's 3 or 4 together, actual chairs but on high poles. [I have no idea how you'd be meant to use them.] Then I think better of it, since they'd probably be very tempting to the kids. They'd probably try to get at them, and hurt themselves. So I grab them back (a stretch) and take them along. We go outside, and across to another building - it's a campus-y sort of place - and I run into Melanie. I'm really surprised to see her here. She says she comes down sometimes to help facilitate these conferences. I tell her I remembered us being here before, and she says yes, it's right through there where we were - pointing through an open door to another small building, whose door I can see facing us. It's a sort of mission-style place, the door sort of rustic and round (or angled?) at the top. I had been working with a man on some project, and we had used this place as a retreat; I remember the heavy wood table in the room just beyond the small foyer, and working by lamplight long hours... we go along to the room where we're going to be meeting. People are elsewhere behind the scenes, getting things ready. Melanie asks me and the 1 or 2 others with me if we want a Coke or something to drink. I ask for water. She says there isn't any, unless I want to use the garden hose. I'd forgotten this place doesn't have any running water inside, you have to bring your own drinks. Oh, well, a Coke'll have to do then. Later, I'm inside the actual library at the circ. desk. It's close to closing time, getting dark outside, and people are lining up to check out. It's a pretty small space, close, and I get an impression of the local community character of the people and staff. There's a bulletin board with community flyers and information on it. But everything seems to be going along quite businesslike."
"413"	"(8/3/94)"	"I'm in the library, just arriving (later in the day - maybe back from lunch or a trip) - it's pretty busy, lots of people in - I notice Ramon checking out. I go into the back room and check who's there. We have a number of people helping us out because we're so shorthanded, people from other branches and downtown. Most are taking breaks, sitting on the floor against the wall - it's a long room, dark with only the oblique afternoon light coming from the wall of windows at the far end. Everybody's in that sort of half-shadow - not dark enough to not be able to see, but not light enough to see clearly. I count heads, and exchange a few words, making sure everybody's okay and we're covered on the desk. I don't want us to get exhausted, and it can be a near thing. I go on into the next room, where there's another workroom. I go back there and [lost - do some stuff, notice the clock, something's wrong with it, it's been moved or it's broken or both] - I have to go out front and check out. But VK's taken away the checkout stand! Why in the world would he do that? Didn't he realize we need it? I have to improvise - quickly I grab a nearby lectern, brown wood, not real sturdy, but it'll have to do. Now I have to gather up circ. forms and so on. In a couple of minutes I'm checking out okay, just making do, but later when I get time I'll have to get things better organized."
"414"	"(7/3/94)"	"I'm in the Business Office, watching Bonnie in another room - she's been called to some kind of meeting and someone is talking. There's a lot of other folks there too, and I can't easily slip in and tell her I'm going out to the drugstore for the rest of my lunch hour. (They're not for the most part sitting around a table or anything, she's sort of perched on a desk and a lot of people are standing up.) A storm is coming up outside and I figure it's now or never, so I get up as close as I can and wave at her. She looks around and I quickly stage-whisper. She says okay, and this other guy from the office says he'll go with me (did Bonnie suggest it?). I don't really want him to, he'll only slow me down - I only have 10 minutes left, and I've been getting antsy about it. [Note: I'm aware in the dream that I really can't make it in 10 minutes, but- I ignore it and try to pretend.] As we're putting our coats on, the storm is increasing, huge claps of thunder and incredible winds. It's pretty stupid to go out there but I'm determined to get away. We're putting on big trench coats like big-business city people - and we're in an office that has old-style metal desks and file cabinets, blinds on the windows, it's a fairly small place. There are swinging doors up at the head - that's where Bonnie went through to the meeting. We're on bicycles now, and we're not going to a drugstore after all, but an antique-restoration place. There's four of us: me, Jenny, Heather, and the guy - unless he's a totally different guy, he's more of a pal now, and he's black now. Tall. We're in the antique place. It's cramped in this little room, with a high yellow light and a cluttered counter. The repairman is middleaged, got some white hair, friendly but quiet. Jenny has brought a piece to him, it's brass or bronze, has pieces [maybe it's a clock] . He examines it, thinking, nods his head, takes it into an adjacent workroom. We chat while we wait, and Heather is looking at something she has with her, a thing with pieces, some of which are pressed glass, a light blue. I take a piece of it to look at, and it's cracked, which surprises me. [This thing may be some kind of lantern.] I say this guy might be able to repair it - there's some other damage - why don't you ask him? She says she might, and I'm thinking of the time too - we need to get back to work. Now we're all back on our bikes, going back a different way than we came, and I'm concerned about it - I hope we don't get lost, or it doesn't take twice as long. We're going down residential streets, very nice, tall trees on each side, mostly shaded from the branches overhead, nice houses. We chat as we ride along, we're having a good time. We come to some stores and/or a restaurant. We ride by the side of one, on the sidewalk, and I'm carefully going around the corner when I see a little boy on a little bike, he's just starting off with a sister and Mom (I'm not sure if Mom's on a bike), and as I go right by him he starts to fall over. He reaches out in a bit of panic, and I grab him just as he's going forward and the bike can't be stopped. [He's probably about 7 - shorts, flowered short-sleeved shirt, sneakers, blonde hair, nice-looking.] I've got his arm, and even though I can't prevent him falling down, I'm easing him down so he doesn't go splat. The bike falls on him, on his rear, but it's not heavy, so it's not doing any damage. I pluck it off of him with my other hand (I'm still straddling my bike) and set it off to the side, then I give him support to stand up. He seems a little surprised, but none the worse for wear. Relieved. His mother says he should thank me, which he does nicely, and I say I'm glad I could help (or some such thing), very cheery, and we pedal on. The incident is reminding me of something, and suddenly I remember we're not wearing helmets. I point this out to the others, saying we might to be careful. (Of course, none of us thought to wear a helmet because we don't care about them, but they did pass that city ordinance. Now I'm self-conscious.) We're still in the neighborhood, and we come to a corner where a group of people are outside, all dressed up in costumes - mostly fanciful, like SCA or fantasy - one girl seems to be Morticia Addams-like. There's something like a garage sale going on [though I think it's more than that] , and we know a few of these people somewhat, so we stop and talk to them. Inside, Jenny's met up with somebody she knows well, and she's hitching a lift back with him. (It seems to be Mel Torme - he's here, but she hasn't said it was him.) [There are big tables in here, piled with big things like maybe carpet rolls or something. It's a bit musty and there's a yellow light, as from a single bulb. Warm.] I say, ""You don't want to ride with us on such a nice day?"" - I've been teasing her for some time about keeping up the pace, are we going too fast for you?, etc. She says, ""I'm a needy smoker - I've got to have a cigarette"". We all laugh, tease a little more, we plan our next route."
"415"	"(7/4/96)"	"I'm on a little trip out of town, trying to get hold of four papers - some sort of legal documents from the city or county or something, that this little lawyer says I need. I've come with somebody (or he/she's come with me, for the ride), but I've sent (him/her) along while I look for the right office in this building. So I get there and apply for the things I need. The clerk comes back with two of them, and says the other two are back in the city. I roll my eyes - of course the little lawyer told me that I'd have to come all the way here for all of them. What a nuisance. I go back and pick up my stuff, and aim for the exit door that leads to the parking lot. Then I hesitate, thinking that I might make better time if I go the other way down the interior hallway. I start that way, stop again, change my mind again and go the other way. Whle we were travelling up here, I kept thinking about getting to a coffee house somewhere. I'd been looking forward to that more than finding the courthouse and getting these papers. Now, since we found the courthouse first and I've gotta go right back now, heaven knows when I'm gonna get any coffee. Nuts. The papers I got seem to be some sort of maps, which show the location of some family property, near. The lawyer's office even shows up - not as such, but I'm pointing out its site to somebody."
"416"	"(7/8/96)"	"I'm looking for a place to live in another town. I don't know where the best areas are, but I'm visiting with some people who can help me look. There's a girl who knows electricity and building - she does something with it for a living - and she helps me examine a place that looks pretty junky. The LT community meetings are being held (outdoors?) under some trees, and I've come early. John Larroquette is here and trying to get a young guy to get up on an elephant - it's kind of a prank, he knows it's hard and he'll have an even harder time getting down. It is pretty funny. He's right in front of me, and swinging around pretty wild, so I get up and move back a bit. He ends up on the elephant, but facing backwards. Oh, boy. Folks start to show up, and I remember I need to tell Grace that I made the phone calls I was supposed to make - I'm way behind. I'm staying in a little, dark apartment with a guy, and another man has just come to stay briefly. We're having a conversation, rather quiet; I'm showing him where things are. I'm getting ready to go somewhere and haven't got all my clothes on, which is usually okay, but I don't know if he's uncomfortable with it, so I mention it to him. It's a little awkward, and I get a little self-conscious. I actually think about what it might be like to have him touch me, as if it might help."
"417"	"(11/12/97)"	"I'm in another city. It's very different, old, sort of European, there are big old buildings and bridges and levels. Someone else is driving, we're crossing a wide street, maybe 4 lanes and as we pass I see a couple of cars heading straight for each other, head-on. I think the one facing away from us is going the wrong way, since it's on the left half of the street - but the oncoming car evades it, and as they clear the lane I can see the arrows, and it was the oncoming car [which was] in a lane marked for the other direction, after all - there's just one oncoming lane. He was lucky. We come to the place I'm staying, with a family, and we decide to go out for a little excursion, still downtown. We drive past a big open space created by the building (no windows, but probably the back of a big department store) and a wide pavement, kind of a mall. There are benches built into the wall and lots of people about, visiting, strolling. There's yellow street light, enough so there are no dark spaces, but not bright. The building wall recedes in places, to form a big alcove. We've gone around various streets and you can see they're not flat - this area goes up and down a lot, it adds to the interest. We stopped and got out to stroll and we're passing a bakery/restaurant, as we walk up into a sort of covered mall. The window is sort of a long bay, leading around inside, and there are wonderful, fancy, hearty breads displayed. One of them looks to me like a tomato bread - dark with a reddish cast. It's a huge round domed loaf with a chunk cut out to show the inside, like some others in the window. I've stopped to admire, and the others gather round. The daughter is next to me, pointing at various ones, and I peer closer at the ""tomato"" bread, thinking maybe it isn't that, but it sure looks good. We agree we have to stop in here, maybe eat something - it seems very cheerful [very European-cosmopolitan] inside. It looks as though they sell the breads by the pound, we should get some to take home too."
"418"	"(11/23/97)"	"Dana Scully is pushing a shopping cart up to a house on a very nice street with old, large brick houses built on a rise - it's gray out. She's hurrying, and a young man is following, he can't quite keep up with her, although he's the one that invited her to come along with him. She goes right up to the house purposefully, and on in, he follows. [She's just going to stay for a bit and then go home - she makes a phone call to let somebody know where she is?] I'm in a house with Candace Bergen (her house? our house?) - I'm sort of her assistant. She's expecting a famous doctor and we're just getting ready, refreshments and that, and I'm a bit flustered, nervous [as if I haven't done this long, or don't do it well...] . There's somebody at the door, and I open it. It's a guy in a suit (balding, glasses, tall, bit of a dork), and I say hello, Dr., [please come in? fading - we discover he's not the right one, perhaps after he comes in, it's awkward.] Another knock - I go again, and it's another guy in a suit, gray wavy hair, handsomeish, tall. I've forgotten his name - I say, ""Yes?"" - hoping he'll say, ""Hello, I'm Dr. ____"" so I can respond to that, but he doesn't, he says [something like] , ""Hello, is Miss Bergen in?"" and I say a name that pops into my head - which isn't the right one, and there's confusion, but at least we get him in, and there we all are including this other guy who's a fifth wheel. I'm in a house with (Sue S.? someone who is a bit older, in charge, sort of mother, sort of leader) - there's a bunch of other girls here, we're a group. I have my own room, off the kitchen, where (she) is. [Something's going on that's faded, but I'm feeling small and vulnerable, the room is a bit more than daytime-dark, it's shadowy. There's hesitance about getting something done. Something specific about clothes tossed on a little chair in the corner next to the door.] Later, there's a trial going on. In the kitchen, (she) is questioning someone - the lights are on bright there. Around the counter/bar, there's me and a few others. We're the ""jury"", and I'm the only one paying much attention. I'm sitting with another girl, and we occasionally exchange some comments, but across a partition and up a level, there's maybe 4 others at a table, and they're just acting like teenagers (I guess we all are) and gabbing away. It gets to where I can't hear the ""witness"", and I say something like, ""Stop talking - no one is hearing what she's saying,"" which of course is rude but much worse, we're supposed to be taking part in this trial. And it may mean I'm the one who has to make the decision because I'm the only one who heard the evidence."
"418a"	"(11/23/97)"	"#418a (11/23/97) I'm with some friends outside - maybe at a cafe patio table or something, happy, chatting - a gray day. A bum (or eccentric) comes by (panhandling?) and we exchange a word or two, he goes off. He has a contraption - something on wheels that he pushes along, it's meant to be some sort of vehicle but he's not in it but behind it, with a long ""steering"" handle-sort-of-thing. He's heading into water just next to us - he thinks the thing will float and he'll travel over it, but obviously it's just junk, and we watch him trundle up to the water (it's very gradual going down), and push the thing forward. Of course it goes further under the water because it's forward [of him] , but under it goes. We're wondering if we should be stopping or helping him or what, but someone thinks we should just leave him alone, so we do. [Same place, I think] I'm by myself now, my friends are leaving. One of them is Peggy, who I've just learned is now operating a Metro Diner with James. This is different for them, but very enterprising, and I think I should come see it. I ask where it is, and she gives me some landmarks - it's in a part of town we don't go to much - and she seems just a hair short of welcoming. I have an impression of her and James thinking I'm a hypocrite for being interested in what they do. (It's just an impression.) She really looks good - her hair is longer and waved sort of 40's-50's, sexy, and her face is different, more sophisticated, great makeup, strong character."
