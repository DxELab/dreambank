(Read the info about the first Sanders series for details about her life.)\n\nThe Hall/Van de Castle codings for characters, social interactions, misfortunes and good fortunes, successes and failures, and emotions are available for each of the dream reports in this sample. For those who want to compare the results of their own methods with those obtained with the Hall/Van de Castle categories, this is a very good sample."
