    "description": "These 23 dreams come from a young boy who went from age 6 to 8 over the course of this dream series. The dreams were reported spontaneously to his mother over a 19-month period.  At first he seemed very interested in telling them, but as time went on, he became less interested in talking about his dreams.  The boy is a classmate of Melissa, whose dream series also was collected by her mother. He is the top male student in his class.  Mark's mother is a friend of a dream researcher, and that is why she had the idea to write down the dreams.  Note: \"John\" is Mark's only sibling, who is five years older."
