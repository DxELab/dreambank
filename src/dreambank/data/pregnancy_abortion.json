    "description": "This is a sample of 19 young women who contributed varying numbers of dreams to a graduate student's dissertation project in the 1990s.  None of the women know each other.\n\nThe names and places in the dreams are entirely fictious.  Ten of the women were three months pregnant; nine had had an abortion three months before they began writing down dreams.\n\nA content analysis of the dreams suggested that there were few or no differences between the two groups, although there are large individual differences (as there always are in any sample of dreamers)."
