    "description": "These dreams, from teenage girls ages 11-18, were collected by four different students at four different suburban schools in the mid-1990s.  Since they were collected by different people at different times and places, they should not be considered a good sample. Instead, they are of interest because they give a rough idea of how dream content changes as girls mature from their preteens through the senior year in high school."
