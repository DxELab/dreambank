So I went to leave, but I punched her (not slow!) and went to this beach type place near some water that was rumoured to be home to an evil fish. I sat down at the edge and this wave came and I fell under. I got to the middle of the water and then ended up at the other side. Chris caught up with me and tried to get me to come back because it was dangerous and he said he loved me. Then this rope landed on my foot. I grabbed it and I was pulled under water and I saw the evil fish and I managed to get to the first bit of water but some rope got around my foot and the fish tried to get me. Chris was pulling me up and I finally got up (after Chris had been pushed away).

Widget was there and was all evil and hissy. I met this girl who believed that I was from ""my time"". She gave me a note one day and told me to read it that night. But for some strange reason I didn't and something happened and she got in trouble and the note went missing.

"0226"	"None"	"(2004-12-28 (13)) Some people and I were looking after a little deli thing. Then I was riding a horse that had a remote thing, which said horse, mouse, cat or something. Then the horse got smaller and turned into a mouse, but I realized it was Gizmo. And people tried to shoot us."
"0227"	"None"	"(2004-12-29 (13)) Some people and I were in the woods and two girls and Jason Lee (except he had a munted face like Tom Cruise did in Vanilla Sky, but later he was Beaver from Dreamcatcher) went away from the rest and something happened and the two girls thought that they were ""getting lucky"" and they left to get their tops. They left and then Jason and I kissed and it turned out we'd been dating for a while. Then I was home around the pool and people were killing things."
"0228"	"None"	"(2004-12-30 (13)) I was at school and unfortunately I had to sit next to Kaleb. Something happened and we had to do research together. Then we were at this creepy ""Moses"" place. People were being scary. There was a waterfall thing."
"0229"	"None"	"(2004-12-31 (13)) Ezra, Ramona, Tiana, some guy I made up and I were doing this thing and we had to defeat people to get out. The first two were creepy things -- skeleton blokes and stuff. We walked through these woods to get to the next place and some creepy people followed us. I was wearing my light blue ""MB"" shorts and the blue top with brown sleeves and had been for the last few days. We got to the next arena place and we had to defeat John Travolta. The other guy (call him Joe) started fighting him and they both had some cool moves. Joe won and I picked him up and kissed him, saying he was the man (all friendly stuff) for beating John Travolta. The next two ""Gods"" were a face of a lady in a square box (who Ezra talked to and that's what you had to do, because she was lonely and then she left) and the last one was the ""oracle"" (who was a face of a lady too). But when Ezra got there, we told him the whole thing was a joke. Then we were at some creepy China town place. They had little animals, and one tried to escape. I cuddled some cute animal. We had to get special cards from a lady to go places. We talked about getting costumes for the quest thing and John Travolta had said to get good escape gear and I wanted to go home to get my shoes. Tiana dressed up and Ramona called her mother."
"0230"	"None"	"(2005-01-05 (13)) I was at a house and Gizmo and all the kittens were there. I can't remember properly, but there was a basement and it had all this creepy stuff, like weapons and science things."
"0231"	"None"	"(2005-01-06 (13)) Ezra and Jayson read my diary. I found out because they kept taking my stuff and they took two pictures of Timothy Olyphant from my diary and then they showed me them by giving me a bag full of stuff they had taken. I was really annoyed but they didn't say anything about it, they just smiled evilly. Then they wanted a million dollars off Peter Gallagher. I had his email and told him and then I had to go with Mom, Ezra and Jayson to somewhere. Also, it was the last day of school in Year 7 and Mr Macklin gave out all our work and I didn't bring it home, but Mom and had gone and got it."
"0232"	"None"	"(2005-01-07 (13)) I was at some new town and there was a boy and a girl who were special. They met after a while, but at first the girl and her mother were chased out of their house. Also, I knew them. The boy had a spaceship thing. Then we were looking at a school for me. We found the only school in town and it was munted. But I went there anyway. At lunchtime some lady shot herself. It had happened there before. There were Christmas decorations up and there was a sleigh in front of one house which two girls and I got into. It flew in the air. Then it crashed."
"0233"	"None"	"(2005-01-08 (13)) I was at a shop and Porky was in the back of the car with a water bottle in a container. I can't remember what happened in the shop, but Ezra and I had to run back to the car to hide. We were also at a pet shop and I had Porky with me and we were also at a ferret place."
"0234"	"None"	"(2005-01-10 (13)) There was a girl or maybe two (I think it was two) that lived with her/their grandparents. The grandparents were hell evil and mean. Anyway the girl/s ran away one night to this pool place. There was this maniac guy there and I was there as well and he started killing people. People kept falling into the pool."
"0235"	"None"	"(2005-01-11 (13)) This guy ran across a road to the other side which was all forest-y. This girl was there and anyway he started bouncing through the forests but like that game where you throw balls [I don't know what the hell I'm talking about here, and I have a diagram but I don't understand it] . The girl chased after him and when they stopped she jumped into his arms and it turned out they were cousins. He also did some bouncy stuff in a shop. I was in a cinema type thing and there was a movie of me and my friends of short clips of things we had done, but there were extra things on it each time we watched it."
"0236"	"None"	"(2005-01-12 (13)) It was the future, except we were all the same age as we are now. We, being Dad, Ezra and I, were at some person's house and when we left some guy had a gun and Dad did something and he got to our car which was really cool and small. Ezra ran down the steps and the guy shot and Ezra and Dad said ""FBI! Freeze!"" and shot the guy. We all hurried into the car. Then this other person was having a party and all these famous people showed up. There was this girl (a celebrity) who got romantically involved with this stupid guy. Her ex (another celebrity) was angry and got evil. Then, or before that, we were at home. An old friend of mine except I didn't really know her was there. We went out to get something from this place out in nowhere. There was this evil lady who nobody liked. Something happened and we ended up surrounded by clouds. This evil bloke sent us all back except for the mean lady who had to stay there for eternity."
"0237"	"None"	"(2005-01-13 (13)) I was at a haunted house with some people for some TV show. Mickey (Scream 2) was there. I ended up in a room with poison gas with another girl except I got out and then this dog chased me and I got in the house from another door. Then the dog took some clothes and we were told it was part of the show. But I hadn't brought any clothes. Jillian was there and some fat women. I borrowed clothes off Jillian to wear and some from a fat girl. Jillian said something about me stretching her clothes. Also this lady said to the girls something about wearing a bra and I said I wasn't because I forgot and don't want the responsibility. When I got the clothes off the girls I went into the toilet and so did the fat girl. I got changed and when I came out, Mickey was outside the cubicle covered in the fat girl's blood. Something also happened at Nana's but I don't remember."
"0238"	"None"	"(2005-01-16 (13)) There were these colourful mushroom houses. We went to a movie shop and got movies, they had Jackass: The Movie commentary and South Park commentary? Someone died as well."
"0239"	"None"	"(2005-01-17 (13)) I was at a two storey house which was my home, I think. Some noob was trying to kill me and some other people and he threw a bomb up onto the balcony. We threw it next door because no-one lived there. Some people from Jackass were there. There were these invisible buildings which you could walk through that sent off signals to the bomb and stuff. There was this train and it almost hit someone but the signal stopped it. I was then at a toy grabbing machine. I wanted a toy they had of me and I had got a toy, some time before, of Dad. There was more to the story, but I don't remember."
"0240"	"None"	"(2005-01-22 (13)) I was at some jail. I let Sark (Alias) out and this other prisoner guy go. The other prisoner fell down and couldn't get up and Sark got caught, I think."
"0241"	"None"	"(2005-01-22 (13)) Ezra had this thing which would make peoples legs go out to the side and their heart would burst. It didn't affect him though and I didn't want it to affect me. So I backed away, but Ezra followed saying it would only affect people far away and then I argued that people over the other side of the world weren't getting affected. I didn't get a reply though."
"0242"	"None"	"(2005-01-24 (13)) I was at a shop and I had Mom and Porky with me. Everyone thought Porky was cute, except for one noob. We were driving around in these gold cart things. Mom went up to some big fancy house that no-one lived in to meet ""a friend"". And people from school were at a shop/school place."
