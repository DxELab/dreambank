"051-1"	"None"	"#051-1 ""My wife to be"" and I were in a store. Apparently the store was near the water because I kept on trying to convince her to drive the boat while I went skiing. She claimed it was too cold to ski. Besides she had to buy snap-together funnels at the store near the water. In the store she was wearing only a towel, and I was holding the towel on her for a while so that she could look for funnels. She passed up quite a few funnels until she got to the snap-together ones. Finaly I got to go waterskiing, but it wasn't my ""wife to be"" driving the boat. It was my sister. But before my sister took me waterskiing, back in the store with my wife, after she bought the funnels we moved onto a different area of the store. We came across a table. On that table were the workout gloves (2 pair) one mine, one my sister's, that she and I had lost in real life. In the dream they were new and didn't have all the holes and stuff in them as they did when we lost them. I told my ""wife to be"" about how comfortable the gloves were and where the holes were and how they fit and how I wish I still had those gloves. I remember hoping that my ""wife to be"" would get the hint and buy the gloves for me for Christmas."
"051-2"	"None"	"#051-2 Real life: My friends and I just bought an eight-track recorder so that the band I'm in could record some songs. Dream: I get home from school one day and these two kids, kids that I know I've seen at Suffolk but don't really know or talk to, are down in my basement. They are playing with the new eight-track recorder. I was worried that they were going to break it. I went upstairs for something and when I came downstairs one of these kids told me he had to use my bathroom. For some reason all the lights were out and my basement seemed distorted. When we finally found the bathroom after some difficulty, I went into the bathroom and, this is disgusting, but I vomited through my nose. Then the dream ended."
"051-3"	"None"	"#051-3 My friends and I went into a cave and dug up some sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, and we threw some of them at a cat but they landed on a washing machine that was across the street in a laundromat. Then we went to a woman's house.(The woman was in my science lab last year in real life. I had asked her out but she said no.) We went into her basement, my friends and I, and turned on the TV. Home Improvement was on, which is the only show I'll watch on occasion. But I wasn't paying attention to the show all the time. I was wondering how I was going to ask her out again. Then the dream ended."
"051-4"	"None"	"#051-4 I have to bring up a recurring dream because it has great significance to the dream I had this week: dream #5. It always starts the same way. I walk down the stairs in my house and out the front door. I walk into the street and I always turn left. I lift my arms up to be perpendicular to my body and wait. Soon a big wind comes by and lifts me up. At first I am nervous. I am afraid of falling. I have no control over what I'm doing and the wind takes me where it wants. If the wind dies down I begin to fall or a large breeze makes me move quickly through the air and I get nervous. But soon I get comfortable with flying and I can turn in any direction I want. The wind dies down less often. I go higher and higher, often I get scared and come down a bit, but when the fear leaves I go higher than I previously was. Eventually I get the hang of flying and am comfortable with it, but I still feel as though somehow I'm missing something. Once I get the hang of flying I often realize that I've got no place to fly to. The dream ends with me kind of floating around aimlessly. I've had dreams along the lines of this one many many times."
"052-1"	"None"	"#052-1 In this dream I found myself on a type of spaceship. The inside looked like the starship Enterprise. This is strange because I really don't like Star Trek. For some reason a door is sliding open and closed, and I am shooting a laser at the opposite wall trying to hit two blinking discs. The laser I'm using isn't working so I switch to something stronger. The first beam was a red beam and this one is now a yellow one. I finally hit one and go out into the hall, walk a little way and enter a room with a sliding door. There is a girl dressed as I am, in some kind of uniform. The girl is someone I know from high school. I can't really remember what made me shoot but I did. The laser hit her in the foot taking a big chunk out. I remember seeing the chunk missing in graphic detail. I remember feeling ashamed I shot her and sad also. That was the end of the dream.    "
"052-2"	"None"	"#052-2 The only thing I remember about this dream is a jar of Guklins mustard rotating by my face. In the dream I don't know who threw it, but it was passing by my face in slow motion. The mustard was going so slowly I could read the label and see the brown specks in it. I could also see how the mustard shifted inside the jar as it rotated."
"052-3"	"None"	"#052-3 This dream was during a nap, taken after Thanksgiving dinner. In my dream I awaken on the bed to find my sister's cat hitting me in the face with his paw. He is not using his claws but I'm so tired I can't move. The cat keeps disappearing under the bed and then attacking. Then he comes up and hits me but has his claws out and scratches my cheek. I awoke and did not know it was a dream until I looked at myself in the mirror and had no scratches."
"052-4"	"None"	"#052-4 In this dream I am lost in a jungle and am walking along when I see this huge object. The object looks like the side of a bloated tick or the side of a huge gray submarine. This object is towering over the trees. I remember feeling afraid of it but going closer anyway. When I am close to it the side splits vertically. A huge elephant comes running out at me. I get out of the way and proceed to watch all sorts of wild animals run through. I think I walked through the split after the animals went through and I'm in my old hgh school. I can see myself screaming at my ex-girlfriend for something, which I have never done. I remember seeing all my friends but they were just staring into space."
"053-1"	"None"	"#053-1 I have an acquaintance, Mark, who offered me a job which I declined. He turned out to be very respectable and has a clear perspective on many issues we are both interested in. I don't know him too well but consider him to be a reliable and trustworthy friend. Through the course of our discussions he has made mention of his homosexuality. I know very few gay men, and have not an iota of respect for the majority of them. Mark is different, in my perspective, though. I had this dream, last night, though. I was meeting Mark and we decided, mutually, to meet at his house. He opened the door wearing a very feminine fake-silk robe with a chiffon collar. This didn't scare me; it pissed me off. I controlled my anger and told him, forthright, that I didn't find his attire appropriate to the occasion, which was just a social meeting to talk about current happenings in our lives -- specifically, his lover just left him, and my lover, who is a heterosexual female to compliment my heterosexual maleness has recently left me. I told him, straightforth, that I was not going to have sex with him . . . ""So go change your clothes, or I'll be leaving and we can keep things between us on a professional level."" End of dream."
"053-2"	"None"	"#053-2 I dreamed that I was laying alone in bed, rousting from a nap, to find that I had a split in the skin underneath my left nipple. It was not bleeding but it was tender and painful. So, for some damned reason, I slowly pulled it off. It totally weirded me out and I woke up. Odd, eh?"
"053-3"	"None"	"#053-3 I dreamt that I woke up next to my girlfriend (which is not altogether unusual, as we spend most nights together), or rather, my former girlfriend as we have broken up but still sleep together. Sounds odd, I know, but it seems to work for us. So I woke up and noticed how pretty she is (I commented on this to myself in the dream) and just kept looking. I was feeling her side, just above her hips, (which I also found to be beautiful and commented to myself accordingly). I kissed her shoulder and her neck just below the ear and climbed out of bed to smoke a cigarette. Next thing I know I am dressed and smoking and taking a leak into the toilet. I go back to the bedroom because it is warm in there and I felt very cold in the rest of the apartment. Her alarm goes off, she climbs out of bed and I turn off the alarm, also a ritual. I get undressed and go back to sleep while she goes to shower. She comes back wet and climbs into bed and puts her arms around me. She is very warm although I feel cold from somewhere. Then she is gone and the bed is wet and cold but I stay and I am shivering. I notice someone else in the room. I don't know who it is but it is sexually exciting. Next thing I know I am awake and my friend/girlfriend is happy to see me and I am happy to see her. This still in the dream but I don't remember anymore."
"053-4"	"None"	"#053-4 My last dream was that I was walking around the city, in and near the neighborhood I live in, in a rainstorm very late at night. I was warm and only wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I was alone. I mean there was no one around and (this is funny) no cars on the streets, passing or parked. There were no cars. So I was walking up Charles Street and the next thing I know I am walking into this dead end of a street also on Beacon Hill. Three guys jump me and I fight back. They say, ""Give us your wallet."" I say, ""I'll give you just the money,"" and they say, ""Give us your leg."" I use a fake leg for walking (not just in the dream, real life, too). I say no. They end up beating me real good but they, in the end, don't get the leg. End of dream."
"054-1"	"None"	"#054-1 I had a dream that a friend and I were in a local Stop and Shop. The store was giving away all the products in refrigeration section free. The store's refrigeration units were not functioning properly. I remember smelling everything I took to make sure it had not spoiled. I took lots of dairy products such as milk, yogurt, cream cheese and ice cream. The store was extremely crowded but my friend and I took what we wanted. Then I woke up."
"054-2"	"None"	"#054-2 I had a dream I went to a store and when I came out I saw some teenage boys in the lot. They were running around the cars like they were wild animals. All of a sudden two of them ran across my car from the hood to the trunk. My hood had a huge dent in it and they cracked my moonroof. I ran after them and they came and saw the damage they had caused to my car. While they were at my car a police car drove by. I told them to come over and they did. They told the boys they should pay for what they had done. The boys agreed to setup a payment plan with me to pay for the damage. I can remember putting a trash bag over the moonroof to prevent leaking of rain into the car. I called the boys to ask them when they would give me the money. Then I woke up."
"054-3"	"None"	"#054-3 I had a dream that I was on the subway on my way to Suffolk. On the train I saw a friend that I have not seen in about a year. We started to talk but I can't recall about what. We finally came to the station,. When we got to the street he walked a different way. I followed him and continued to talk to him. Finally when I realized how I was so far off track I told him I had to go to school. He was going for a job interview. Then I woke up."
"054-4"	"None"	"#054-4 I had a dream that I was younger. I was over at a friend's house during the summer. We (people I used to be friendly with) were playing gin by the pool. I remember that I wanted to go home. I kept looking at my watch. I saw on my watch that I did not have to stay much longer. They did not want me to leave because they could not continue to play gin. I wanted to go home but I did not want to say it to them. Then my alarm went off. I got out of that situation."
"055-1"	"None"	"#055-1 My first dream occurred the 17th of November. Although it was not as scary as previous ones, it was very confusing. The first recall was my grandmother's house in Venezuela. I think the family was having a party for whatever the reason. The confusing part is when I bump into my friends (high school friends) from Miami. I felt guilty when seeing them because I did not invite any of them to my sister's wedding last August, 1992. (My reasons for not inviting them included inconsideration and neglect from them., e.g., every time I was in Miami for the holidays/vacations, I would call them to make plans. Unfortunately, they had their excuses and/or made plans with me but never followed up on them. During my grandmother's party they neglected me again and would not even look at me. Suddenly my dream shifts from those high school friends to one kid named Joey Levy. During my sixth and seventh grade years, this kid became my so-called friend. His mother and my father attended high school in Venezuela years ago. The Levys also lived in Miami and therefore gave Joey and me a reason to become friends. Joey was the cynical, sarcastic kid who I hated. Through Joey, I was able to meet his two friends, Mark Cedar and Maurice Gabay. The one thing we had in common was soccer. We played for ""K-Land."" They played in the 71-A team while I played on the 70-B team. They were better athletes than I was. I therefore always envied them. Anyway, the friendship between these three guys and myself soon disappeared after my Bar-Mitzvah. I took the big initiative not to invite Mark Cedar (because I didn't like the way he treated me in camp the previous summer. I was hurt and angry at him.) This was a big soap opera during those years. Afterwards, Joey would make me feel guilty for not inviting Mark. Back at my grandmother's, Joey had clearly changed. He was no longer the pain-in-the-butt, sarcastic rascal. He went to Israel after high school and came back a pot-smoking liberal. I actually felt comfortable with him for once. However, he did seem depressed for reasons unknown. He told me that Mark received a tennis scholarship to Frostburg State University in Maryland. Similarly, Maurice received a soccer scholarship to Florida State where he was the leading scorer and star of the team."
"055-2"	"None"	"#055-2 My second dream included one of my biggest fears: sharks. I can only remember few details and therefore the end of the dream is quite distorted. The setting takes place on the water. I was accompanied by a ""mother-figure"" in her late thirties. Also, there were approximately four kids with us. The scary part occurs when a shark (the same shark from ""Jaws"" the movie) eats one of the kids. The rest of us jump on the closest dock for our protection and safety. The setting suddenly shifts from the dock to the cafeteria of Camp Shalom. (I attended Camp Shalom when I was a youngster.) There were townspeople from Orange Springs, Florida in the cafeteria when we arrived. It turns out that the townspeople knew about our tragedy but refused to believe us. I responded in an angry and anxious manner and then I woke up."
"055-3"	"None"	"#055-3 This dream occurred on December 7. The topic was a phone call I was going to make on December 20. One of my buddies from Maryland is getting married on December 19, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Unfortunately, I cannot attend the wedding because I will be flying down to Miami the next day from Boston. My ticket is nonrefundable and to exchange it for different destinations (i.e., Washington D.C. or Virginia Beach) would have cost a fortune. Anyway, my friend called me up about four days ago wanting to know if I were going to attend. I explained to him the situation and let him know that there was a ""gift"" on the way. Furthermore, I let him know that I was going to call him on December 20 from Miami. The day had arrived. It was December 20 and I forgot to call him. I felt extremely guilty when he ended up calling me instead. I could sense the disappointment in his voice. Then I woke up!"
"055-4"	"None"	"#055-4 My friend (Joel) and I were in a big house. There were four young girls playing somewhere in the house. These girls were approximately ten or eleven years of age. At first Joel and I were just watching the girls socialize in the backyard. They were congregated around the swimming pool with what looked like dolls. Anyway, we went back in the house, where the girls were playing in several rooms while Joel and I were watching TV downstairs. Suddenly, we heard several knocks right above us. We figured out that the father was coming downstairs. As soon as he made his way down the stairs Joel hesitantly took off running. I followed him outside until we were not in clear view: He then (desperately) asked me to call a cab from the payphone in the backyard. He told me of a party that was going on that night. He suddenly flipped me a coin but I didn't react to it quickly enough. He flipped me a second coin as if he were James Dean. I proceeded to call the cab and I woke up as soon as it arrived."

She had all her clothes on and I was totally naked. While we were kissing her mother came down the stairs. I jumped up and hid in the bathroom. Her mother came down and for some reason there was a space about a foot wide between the bathroom door and the wall. And her mother just looked in and kept staring at me."

I was standing while being pushed and I could see the driver. It was an older woman with short dark hair and glasses. When I jumped away from the car I ran up to the lady's door and I started to yell at her. She drove away but kept looking back. Then she smashed into a parked car. The last thing I could remember was that I was running away from the car, after she hit."

"058-1"	"None"	"#058-1 My friends and I were supposed to go to Boston one night, around 6 or 7 pm. The train was the last one that night, even though the last one is usually at 11:00. For some reason, the train was leaving from my old high school bus stop. Everyone was meeting at my house, which is about a two-minute ride from the stop. They were at my house, but I was really late. This is very unusual, because I'm always early. They were in my kitchen and kept telling me to hurry, as I was. We decided that they'd leave and I'd meet them at the bus/train stop. Now, there's only a couple of minutes 'til the train's departure. I raced out of my house, down the stairs and across the lawn, but I forgot my pants. I ran back, put them on, and ran out again, but forgot my asthma medicine. To make a long story short, I forgot my wallet and my coat, and ran back and forth every time for each item. Eventually, I got to the street, knowing there was no way I could make the train. Then my friend's car drove over the hill to meet me. The car was red, even though I don't know anyone with a red car. They stopped next to me, and they looked disappointed. Then I woke up."
"058-2"	"None"	"#058-2 I went to the music store that I always go to in Wilmington. This time though, it looked much different. It looked like a sporting goods store I had been in years ago, which had a wooden, cabin-like exterior. The proprietor, who is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, was there, but I don't know if we talked. He was busy with some paperwork behind the desk. Meanwhile, I was going through a large selection of sheet music, which was in plain cardboard boxes. Also in the boxes were some pieces of cake and some other things like muffins and cookies. I had a piece or two, but started eating them secretly so the guy wouldn't see me. They didn't taste that good."
"058-3"	"None"	"#058-3 I called a girl that I knew in high school on the phone. While talking to her on the phone, I could see her -- like on TV when two people talk on the phone and the black line on the screen separates them. The conversation was regular, just ""Hi"" and ""How are you?"" Nothing major. However, this is a sharp contrast to the experience I had when I actually called her last summer. She was hard to hear, like another phone in her house was off the hook, and there was a lot of background noise. The conversation didn't go well, as if she didn't know me."
"058-4"	"None"	"#058-4 The store where I used to work closed in January, and I had a dream that it opened again. I didn't know until I happened to walk past the now-empty store and noticed that it was like a busy Saturday. I went in and found some of my old employee friends working, and they greeted me the way they usually do. Also, everything was switched around, with clothing racks facing different ways and what have you. I went home and told my mother. I said something like, ""Well, I guess I'd better apply again."" For some reason, my mother did not seem too enthusiastic about the situation. This is surprising, because she loved that store and the fact that I was working there. I also remember wondering if the old managers were back, in addition to a few other choice individuals."

Coach Ford set a play up for McHale but I took the ball myself and took a 15-footer from the top of the key and hit it to win the game. The crowd went wild.

I got a beautiful blonde to dance with me. As we were dancing the shady-looking guy grabbed my woman and put a gun to her head. Everyone was screaming and none of the bouncers would do anything. At one point the guy took the gun away from her head and pointed it in the air. In that instant I jumped at him and knocked him down. I took the gun. The blonde was so grateful and was all over me.

The dream occurs in this beige-colored room -- not quite brown -- with no doors and no other way out. Throughout this dream I am a small particle in this huge room and all I seem to be doing is looking for a way out. The reason why I keep looking is because there is this deep man's voice calling my name. It keeps getting closer and closer to me. I am totally helpless in this dream because I can go nowhere. However, I somehow find a way to get out of the room. I'm not quite sure how but it does me no good. Because when I get out I end up in another room exactly like the one I was just in except that it is white and not that beige color. The thing that is weird about this dream is that it occurs in slow motion and I can't seem to move fast enough to get away from the voice. If I do the whole process starts all over again. Everytime I hear the voice all I want to do is run, but there is nowhere to run. That's all I remember about the dream and I never know if anything or what happens to me. Basically, I wake up right when the voice gets so close that it is in back of me and when I turn around to see who or what it is I can still see nobody and usually I wake up."

I was so scared and nervous, because I never fall asleep while studying. Usually I don't wait until the last minute to study, but for some reason in my dream I did. When it came time to go to school I was so afraid that I would fail that I crammed for the two hours I had before the test. Also, I would have to run to the bathroom and throwup because I was so nervous because I knew I had not studied enough. Sure enough I took the test and failed. But not only did I fail, but I also could not cope and dropped out of school because of it. The end result is that I ended up workiing at some kind of convenience store for the rest of my life as a cashier. The scariest thing about the dream was when I woke up. Sure enough I was dreaming this dream. I really did have a psychology test and I really did fall asleep while studying. In some way my unconscious was trying to tell me to wake up and to study because I knew I could never let myself fail. Thankfully I had a good understanding of the material, but I still could do better. I'm still in school and I didn't fail. It was scary, though, because it was like deja vu.

Even though my license says I'm 20 years old, the bouncer let me in with full knowledge of the fact that I was not old enough to be there. The feeling of being able to go in the bar was awesome. I was psyched because all my friends are at the age of 22 and always go out without me because I can never go into the bar with them. Finally I was able to go out and have a good time with them. The weird thing was that even though I got into the bar, I had a horrible time. You see in the dream I was the only one over 21. The rest of them were only 20 and could not get in, so the roles were reversed. Basically having the dream proved to me that life is not always so good if you live by ""only if"" phrases. Because I used to say only if I was old enough when the fact of the matter was in the dream I was, but they weren't. This still was depressing for me.

I made purchases with my Baybank Mastercard that allowed the store to bill my account. I was a bit nervous maybe there was not enough money in my account, I thought. I wasn't sure whether the bank paid the store or not. So this confusion led me to dream about the ATM giving me a receipt of my transaction, which would have displayed my balance. Strange, isn't it?"
"089-2"	"None"	"#089-2 [The dream happened after or before the ATM dream.] In this dream, I dreamt I had my ""Horizon Reader"" book in my bag. I believe the reason why I dreamt about the book was probably due to my eagerness in having it. I left my book in my locker, because my bag was heavy enough. I didn't need to increase the load. So I left it in my locker. But now I regret having done that because I have a reading assignment due next week. I was elated to find in my dream that my English ""Horizon Reader"" was in my bag. Of course this was just a dream. My book is actually in my locker. Strange, isn't it?"

I saw myself outside of my room, while a maid came down with [illegible] equipment. When she got close enough to me, she said things to me that I could not accurately remember. But I did remember her saying price figures. I believe she wanted to sell herself for fifty dollars. I bargained with her and lowered the price to thirty dollars. She agreed to the price. So she would grant me sexual pleasure for thirty dollars. I also agreed. Then strange things happened. I found myself in the bathroom of my hotel room. From the bathroom, I could see people discussing things, just normal things (not sure about the contents). I started feeling guilty; I started changing my mind. I didn't want to have sexual pleasures with the maid. From the bathroom, I could see the maid preparing my bed. She wore [illegible] clothes. The dream ended there. Strange, isn't it?"

The house has a tall musclelike structure above the rest of the house. The dream began with an eerie feeling that I was at Harvard University. Somewhere near the top of the muscle structure there was a nest for a white bird. The view of the house in my dream moved from top (bird nest) to the bottom of the house. The whole house was in view. The transition from top to bottom was accompanied by a U2 music. I don't listen to U2 music but I did once see a video of U2 of one of their songs. There were some people in my dreams on the ground who were supposedly making a movie. I think the director was U2 lead singer himself. He was at the same time the music player. I don't know from where. That was it. Strange, isn't it?"

She said nothing but looked at me with disapproval. This all happened in slow motion. I saw a brunette as me, who I knew at the time but I can see her face now. I got on the elevator. There were several people who I didn't know. As soon as the elevator started up I knew what was going to happen. The elevator shot through the top of the hotel. No one panicked though. Everyone was very calm. I pulled the doors apart and we were hundreds of feet in the air. We slowly fell towards the ground. None of us was concerned. We just watched as we fell. It was actually a cool feeling free falling with no anxiety. The next thing I'm walking out the front door of the hotel.

The weird thing was that when everything was still cold and before I put it in the microwave the cheese that I put on it was melted already. Then I asked the guy, who looked like he was part of the Hell's Angels, if he liked the cheese melted and he wanted to know why it was melted before I cooked it. Then he asked me how much hamburg I put in. I showed him the little bit I had put in. (We put things in a dish when we cook in microwave.) Then he said that I should charge him less. I told him I put pastrami in it also so it would be the same price. Then he got upset. I was nervous when getting everything ready and I took out a hot dog roll to put the sandwich in but he said he wanted a sub roll. Then another customer wanted something at the lottery so I went over to take care of that person. There were all these people at the counter.

I locked all the doors and windows so no one could get in and then the kids started throwing bricks in at the windows. I became scared so I called the police. They never came. Then my brother and I went outside through a window or something that they could not see me leave. We watched them throw bricks at the house. Then one of them wandered over to us, and I began to talk to him. He was siding with me and forgiving me for throwing a brick at them. Then he called them, the rest of the kids, over to us and they were not so forgiving. They tried to hit me over the head with a brick so I tried to cover my head.

Groups of us were sequestered into various locations throughout the prison. The conditions of the cells were very primitive. They were large rooms with cement floors that were covered with straw. Upon arrival at the prison, our clothes had to be traded in for very worn, loose-fitting outfits that were tied at the waist with ropes. The prison, being the actual size of Fenway Park, seemed very large. There were very few people around except for ouselves and prison officials. While we were unable to go outside of the prison, we were permitted to move around inside of it. The halls and passageways were relatively empty, but there were people working at the concession stands. At one point the other prisoners and I decided I should attempt to buy some beer at one of the concession stands. I found a beer stand and asked if I were allowed to purchase some beer. I reached into my pocket and found money that I could pay for it with. The attendant replied that I could buy some beer if I hadn't had any codeine within the last 20 hours. I remembered that the prison officials had given me some medications earlier that day with codeine, so I was not able to have the beer.

We got caught and the Indian was sticking a needle right into my finger. This hurt, within the dream, and then I woke up."
"153-1"	"None"	"#153-1 I dreamed I was trapped inside of a plastic cage. I dreamed it was my girlfriend's mother who was holding the key to get out. She and her daughter were laughing at me becuase I could not get out. After that I remember just opening the door, because it was never locked. When I stepped out I felt like I was falling down stairs and woke up suddenly."
"153-2"	"None"	"#153-2 I dreamed that I met up with one of my girlfriend's best friends. She was trying to seduce me to sleep with her. I kept saying no, that I cannot. If Kathy ever knew what was going on or, what she said she would kill me. To make a long story short I did sleep with her. When I woke up it was my girlfriend next to me not her best friend. I remember waking up and sweating. I could feel my heart pounding. I realized it was a dream and flung my head back with relief."
"153-3"	"None"	"#153-3 I remember coming out of a hair salon and everybody laughing at me. Extensions were put in my hair and it was down to my butt. I could not see it, only people looking at me could see it. The reason why I think I had this dream was because that day I got a haircut. The lady shaved it too short in the back and it looked stupid."
"153-4"	"None"	"#153-4 This dream was very recent. I dreamed I was doing finals and right after finals I flew down to Cancun, just by myself. It turned out I went swimming in a pool in Cancun. There was a bar in the water in a cave. When I swam up to get a drink I heard my name being called over the speaker. There was a guy speaking half Mexican-Spanish and half English. What I remember him saying was that I forgot to feed my dog and I had to go home. Next thing I knew I woke up and my dog was licking my face."
"154-1"	"None"	"#154-1 Last night's dream was a dream that I realized when I woke up and smelled the coffee that is what it was, only a dream. I had watched the hockey game on TV and saw one of the players score four goals and the crowd was going crazy. The dream that I had was that it was me who was on the TV set playing professional hockey and receiving all that attention. I have currently two close friends who play professional hockey and during the summer they are constantly being recognized in the public and it drives me crazy. So before going to bed I started to wonder how it would feel to be in the limelight. It was a great feeling: going out and everybody just would stop and ask me for my autograph. A good feeling."
"154-2"	"None"	"#154-2 The dream that I had was that I won the megabucks. I had won 30 million dollars. At the beginning it was great but I ended up being miserable. People that I was close to started to say that I was snobbish and was always bragging about myself. I always thought prior to this dream that having an overabundance of money would be the best thing in the world. I found out in my dream that it was nothing but problems. It seems that every time I have strange dreams, I would have a conversation with somebody about certain topics such as money and the topic develops into a dream that night. I discovered in my dream that I had so much money that by being [illegible] I was trying to get rid of it but that was just as hard."
"154-3"	"None"	"#154-3 I saw myself being the MVP in my softball league in my dream. Also I was given the Most Improved Player award and also being voted to the Allstar team. I was told that everybody who was on my team was so surprised that they never thought that I could turn my performance around so quickly. I was hitting homeruns like it was nothing and also making catches that I only could make and no one else. Every time I would show up at the ball park, people would start to talk and I could hear the positive remarks that were being said about me. I ended up making a diving catch in the championship game. When I woke up to go to the bathroom the next day, I looked in the mirror and wondered, some day I wish the dream never ended."
"154-4"	"None"	"#154-4 A few days ago, I watched a show called Rescue. There was a police officer who saved a grocery clerk from being killed in a hold-up. My goal in life is to be a successful police officer. During my dream, I was considered to be a brave cop and was always thought of as being gutsy. There was a situation where I was driving in my cruiser and was called to a scene where a man had a gun to a woman's head ready to kill her. I risked my life in trying to save her by going in the bar and trying to talk to him. I succeeded but sweated every moment. All that I remember was that the suspect threatened to kill me. When I woke up the next day, I started to question about becoming a police officer. A frightening dream."
