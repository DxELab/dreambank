    "description": "Nancy is a bright, attractive, white working-class woman in her late 20s who has two young daughters and wants to go to a professional school in a health-related field after she finishes her undergraduate work.  Her dreams seem to be a dramatization of all her interests and interpersonal relations, as she confirms in her own analysis of the dreams.  She has a fact-oriented, no-nonsense mind.  She prefers scientific courses to humanistic ones.  There is nothing subtle about her dreams, and they do not seem as metaphoric as some of the other college dream series.
