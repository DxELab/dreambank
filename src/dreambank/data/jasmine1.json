    "description": "Jasmine is a young woman who recorded hundreds of her dreams from age 14 to 27. In addition to the young age at which Jasmine started keeping a dream journal, there is another unique feature to this series: Jasmine was born with optic nerve hypoplasia, an atypical form of blindness. She can recognize people by means of their hairstyle, their hair color, and the way they walk (and of course she can recognize their voices because her hearing is normal). She can read 26-point type if it is very close to her face, so she did not rely on braille growing up. For reading regular-sized print, she has a video magnifier that takes a picture of the document and enlarges the image on the screen. For working with her computer, she uses text-to-speech and screen-magnifying programs.  Because Jasmine's dreams were tape recorded, usually in the morning, they are often longer and contain more detail than most dream reports.  (For more information about Jasmine and her dream series, including the \"cast of characters\" in her dreams, click here.)"
