"0001"	"(????-??-??)"	"After he left, another young man came out from behind the reception desk. I told him I was waiting for Debbie Phillips [unknown in waking life] . He said, oh yeah you have some forms to fill out. At that point I felt like I was a new employee. I don't know why I thought that. He walked away and I was just kind of wandering around the front office area there. There was an antique sewing machine there. Very similar to mine only I remember thinking how large it was and how I guess this interested in it. I remember thinking how much I like antiques. There was no name on it. It didn't have the make of the sewing machine like mine has on it. I don't remember seeing the pedal at the floor, but I walked around the front and pulled some of the drawers open. There were papers and stuff in there. At that point, the second young man came back out. I said, sorry, I'm just really interested in antiques. I have an antique sewing machine, but this one is larger and I was somewhat intrigued by it. He said, oh, that's okay."
"0002"	"(1991-01-31)"	"I was still living on Lakeland Dr. It was winter and snowing. There were a couple of inches on the ground. It was night and I had to distribute the mail to everyone on our street. As I was sorting out the mail for one home. A young man, about 25-30 years old, asked if he could help. I said no but he insisted. Shortly after Connie B and one of her kids joined us. We had some difficulty sorting the mail and had a discussion about one piece that belonged to me."
"0003"	"(1991-01-31)"	"It is summer. I'm still living as a single mom on Lakeland. My family lived on the same street. I saw Brian F go in their house dressed in his underwear and a man's pink negligee with a girl on each arm. He leaned out the window and invited me in but I said no. I was in my house looking out the window and could see one of the neighbor's home movies. It was a little boy by a fence learning to play baseball. He is batting but he keeps missing. The little boy was Connie's son. I then went to Connie B's house. Their whole family was there. One of the men said I was his. I was interested in his brother. We were all talking and laughing. I felt that they really liked me. I was the life of the party. We were discussing swimming pools and hot tubs. The man I was interested in was with two women. He said the image of me in a swimsuit was gross. I became very quiet and sad. I left and went to my family's house. I made a comment about them living on the same street and never coming to see me."
"0004"	"(1991-02-02)"	"I went to visit Tim W at WDF. When I arrived, they had made many changes including how to get in. I had to enter one side of the building, climb up and across a wall that had many tools hanging on it. It was a big empty room and there were two men receiving tennis lessons. As I finally made it halfway across the wall, one of the men showed me an easier way to get to the entrance. I went up two flights of stairs and entered the door. It brought me into the company breakroom. I noticed a group of people at one table that included Freda L, Jeff L, and Susan J. They didn't even say hello. I tried to sit down with them and someone made a comment about me taking up too much room. I got up to leave. Then Susan J asked what was wrong. I said no one even said hello. She got up to go with me. She took me on a tour of the new plant. Her area was a special project she was experimenting with. It involved raising African Violets and using the petals to create dyes for fabrics. I then went on without her as she started watering her plants. In the next part of the plant they were showing me how they were testing this dye to create prints on fabrics. One of the people painting was the attorney who shops at NTNS. Now they're using these dyes and this process on people's hair. I was very frustrated with how they were doing it. It was all I could do to keep from saying something. Then they convinced me to let them do my hair. I finally spotted Tim W but he was with his boss. I realized I wouldn't be able to talk with him. As I left, I went back thru the employee breakroom and was spotted by Marcia N. I didn't especially want to see her. She came up to me and spoke briefly. It was much easier getting out of the building than it was getting in."
"0005"	"(1992-??-??)"	"I was asking someone to do the remodel at the store. I was worried that if the committee followed my advice and went with the lowest quote that they wouldn't work out. It turned out to include Cliff S and Don St. I kept reassuring the committee that it was going to be great because I know these men. I told the men that my job and reputation were riding on this and the work had to be good. I kept remembering when Cliff S and I had a crush on each other in the eighth grade. The building they were remodeling was now a church. We started the work without approval. When the committee came by, they thought it looked great. The carpet went clear up the walls in some places. In one place, they had a huge multi-level flower cut into the carpet. It looked great."
"0006"	"(1992-02-13)"	"I was the owner of a new restaurant. I was going around to the tables asking the patrons if everything was okay. At one table were two men. I sat down with some friends at a nearby table and could overhear their conversation. One asked the other what he thought of me and his answer was, ""Magnificent."" When they got up to leave, he came by our table to say thank you and shake my hand. After shaking my hand, he held it for a few seconds. I was having trouble with some of the employees not getting along with each other. They wanted to quit because of that and/or because of changes at the restaurant. Through conversations, they all convinced themselves to stay. There was some problem with the customers. We were serving too slowly. We also rectified that situation."
"0007"	"(1992-02-15)"	"I was at a party at Adam's house. They had many of their friends there and I felt very uncomfortable and out of place there. There was one man there, younger than me, who seemed to be interested in me. I couldn't believe that he would be. However, he was persistent and we ended up getting close. Not sexual, but emotional. We held hands, talked a lot, and kissed. Later I was with him and my family."
"0008"	"(1993-??-??)"	"I saw myself with Gary S. It was the Victorian Era. We were in bed together. He was stabbing me. I believe he was stabbing me rather than I him"
"0009"	"(1993-02-16)"	"I was driving down the road passing all these very strange and odd-shaped vehicles. They were many different shapes and sizes. I was in a vehicle that you could drive on the road or in the air, similar to what the Jetsons cartoon characters would drive. I was trying to get home from Kentucky, I think, with some friends. We were all in our own vehicles. We were disagreeing on what highway to take. We were all in the air looking down at the different highways branching off from where we were. As I started on my way, the surroundings suddenly changed. I was no longer in a vehicle and no longer on a highway. The best way I can describe this is a car wash for people. I was lying down going thru their curves and down the hills through machines, sponges, etc."
"0010"	"(1993-02-27)"	"Dan M was wearing a pair of shorts. He had a small tattoo of two leaves and a vine on one leg. The other leg was almost covered with the same design but I couldn't tell if it was an actual tattoo."
"0011"	"(1993-02-27)"	"I was on a houseboat, fishing and doing laundry. I was joined by some friends and we decided to have a contest. I caught the first two fish. Someone else was doing the laundry. I kept urging them to work faster, as if it had something to do with the fishing contest."
"0012"	"(1993-02-28)"	"I was babysitting for Matthew and Michael A, but I had to prepare for a show. The show or meeting was to be held at my mother's hometown at a VFW hall. I was having trouble getting ready while babysitting. I asked Aunt P and Aunt H to babysit at their house. They agreed. A short time later, they showed up with Michael A. They were having a difficult time with him. He said he wanted to see me for a little while. A short time later, I went outside to take him back and they were sitting in the driveway waiting. Later, when I left to check on them, they were in the driveway again. This time Aunt J was with them and a fourth person I can't identify. They were having a lot of trouble with Michael A. The fourth person was finally able to pacify him. She gave me directions to the meeting. I went to my meeting. Theresa Ah had made some suggestions for my meeting and the signs. The meeting room was much smaller than I had expected. There were no signs, but the room was full of people. I was supposed to dress as a man. I was only half dressed. I took Michael A back to Theresa Ah and didn't tell her what a problem he was."
"0013"	"(1993-02-28)"	"I was working for NTNS but we were in a huge warehouse. I had been cleaning up and organizing. I found some racks with children's clothing so I rolled them over to the children's section intending to transfer them later. When I went back to do it, Darren was there doing it. I went on cleaning up. I was finding lots of racks with wheels that we didn't know we had. I ran into a stock boy also cleaning up, moving things, and throwing things away. We had a discussion about why they had saved all this stuff. I was then approached by one of the committee chairs about a problem. It seems someone had given two families a very large amount of clothing free and used my name. I tried to tell her I didn't do it. I finally found out that Darren and Angie Ho were responsible for one and a woman named Debbie [unknown in waking life] the other. Darren and Angie were operating as an independent agency helping the underprivileged. They helped themselves to our stock. They did have an office our building. Even after we told Angie Ho she couldn't do this, she continued under a disguise and alias. I finally caught her and turned her in. Also, she was posing as a government employee giving advice on raising and caring for children. I reported her as unqualified and mentioned that BJ would be great for this kind of work. The committee chair still did not believe me. We found Debbie, but it was her word against mine and the committee chair believed her. I found many different rooms on different levels, piled with boxes full of supplies, racks, etc. I also wound my way around an upstairs workroom and back out again."
"0014"	"(1993-03-02)"	"Bruce S was dressed as a woman. I can't remember why. Later, we were both dressed up in very elegant clothing and we went out to dinner and dancing. We became very close and intimate. Ray H and Kay H were furious that their son, but it was still Bruce S, would be dressed as a woman. He had each of us urinate in a bottle and then was squirting us in the face with it while yelling and screaming."
"0015"	"(1993-03-07)"	"I was married to the man who plays Jack in the TV program Love and War. Here his name is Ben. I had a baby. We named him Benjamin. The baby wasn't well and was going to have to spend the first two years of its life in the hospital. The problem is that he would occasionally just stop breathing. My family and friends were keeping me posted on how the baby was doing. I was sobbing often and a lot and having trouble coping."

"0019"	"(1995-11-03)"	"I was visiting Matthew's school and as I was walking around the premises there I ran into Bill F. I was very surprised. Quite shocked, honestly. He had never been there before. I didn't know that he was coming up here to visit. I didn't know that he even knew where the school was so I was very surprised to find him there. We were sitting at the school watching traffic go by. We could see a playground from where we were sitting. As we were sitting there, I realized that we were moving. We were both sitting but somehow we were moving. We finally got up and walked back to where we were and walked back then to my car. We were talking about he was there. He expressed a lot of frustration with Daddy. He made some comments about the possibility of moving out. With some hesitation, I suggested to him that Brian F leave Chantelle F and that he and Brian F move to Indy, buy a house, and live together. Then I suggested, hesitantly, that maybe he should spend two weeks with me as kind of a trial period. It would help me out. He could pay me some rent. He could be there for Matthew when I'm not. It would be a good situation for me too. We should do it on a trial basis. While we're talking, we're driving back to the apartment. When we get to the apartment, I go in and realize that I had been robbed. It's somewhat odd, the things that they took. The living room was completely cleaned out. There was nothing left in there. I went in the kitchen and the refrigerator was gone. I remember thinking that I would have to replace the refrigerator as well as all my food. The dryer was gone but not the washer. My apartment had a window air conditioner and they had taken that out of the window and set it on the floor. I went into my bedroom and the only thing that was gone out of my bedroom was my bed. When I came back into the living room, Bill F and Matthew were standing there waiting for me. Bill F commented that something just didn't feel right. At that point, I realized that I didn't check the bathroom. I went to check the bathroom and the door was closed. I opened it without thinking first. There was somebody in my shower. I quickly closed the door and we ran out of the apartment and ran next door to a neighbor called Pop. Pat C and some friends were in her apartment doing laundry and I asked if I could use her phone to call the police. She, of course, let me. I called the police. I don't remember the conversation. After I hung up I went back into the apartment because I thought he would be gone by now. Just as I opened the apartment door, Bill F and Matthew were behind me; this huge man was standing there. I yanked the apartment door closed and as I held it closed, I waved Bill F and Matthew back into the neighbor's apartment. I let go, ran into the neighbor's apartment, and locked the door. This burglar came out of my apartment. He was slamming against the neighbor's door trying to get it open. He finally did get it open. He said he was just looking for a place to take a shower. He didn't say anything about all the things that were gone or missing. He asked if I would rather if he came in there and finished his shower. I said no, no. I pushed him out. I watched and he had trouble getting out of the actual building. He went ahead and left. I started to think that insurance would take care of everything, but then I realized I had no property insurance. How could I get my property insurance reinstated if I file a report, or how could I get my insurance back and then make the claim and still have everything covered by insurance. I started thinking about the morality of that and thought that wasn't right for me to do that. I'll just have to suffer the lost. I also started wondering if friends or family would take up money to help me. How would I replace my lost things? I could get the new bedroom suite that I had been wanting for a long time. Just different odd things like that. The other thing that I remember about the dream that I find very odd, both that it was in the dream and that I remember it was that when I was in the neighbor's apartment there was a cat in there, standing on it's hind legs, urinating into a bowl. I remember the neighbor moving the bowl a little so the cat didn't urinate on the carpet."
"0020"	"(1997-05-12)"	"Doctor Pi and I were in a room talking about some of my course work. He started to leave. As he started to leave, I began to get undressed. He turned around and came back in. I had taken off my nightgown and was now holding it up against me to keep myself covered. He made some comment about my not having anything on. I told him I thought he was leaving, that was why I did it. He went on to make some comment about what people on campus would say or do if we were personally involved. He said something about getting fired and then something else I don't remember about it being risky. I said, maybe I don't mind the risk! He just looked at me kind of odd and half-smiled then left. The next thing I knew we were in a bedroom, still talking about my classes. I was lying in bed covered with a blanket but had no clothes on. Doctor Pi was sitting on the bed beside me with his back to me, though he was leaning against me, and he had one hand on me I must have said something to him about being worried because he said, yeah, I'm scared too. Then he smiled reassuringly. Students kept coming in to ask him questions. I was worried about this but it did not seem to bother him."
"0021"	"(1997-05-13)"	"I was with Bill F at SMW. We were trying to see where Doctor Pi lives. We went in this large building. It looked like a combined office and storage space. Everything was a mess. There were many different rooms. Each room had many different things in it. no boxes. but things sitting out piled on tables and such. I finally looked into one room and I saw Doctor Pi. He was sitting with his back to me, watching TV and combing his hair. Bill F and I walked away and looked into this big double-door closet. I don't remember what was in there. Suddenly Doctor Pi saw us. He seemed a bit embarrassed at his living arrangements. He said that most of his money goes to child support so he couldn't afford much in terms of a place to live. The next thing I remember is he saying that he loves me and wants to marry me. I replied that I love him to and that I accept. We talked a bit about Matthew and about Belle."
"0022"	"(1997-06-15)"	"I came to the store and Nicki T was working. She said nothing to me but was working on wearing a cordless phone, which was made to fit into a carry bag of sorts that was to be worn over the shoulder. The base with the numbers was carried in the back part and the speaker/receiver in the front. She was working closely with a sales associate named Nicki T. I reminded her that the phone is only for the store manager and store business. She just shrugged her shoulders. I took her into the back room of the store to talk with her about the apology and other related things. This wasn't our real backroom. It looked like the backroom of the drug stores where I used to work. We were sitting across from each other at a 6ft. table. As we were talking someone just appeared sitting in a chair next to me. I did not recognize her. She told me she was an angel. She was a large woman with very long, permed, light brown hair, which she wore parted in the middle and hanging straight down. I asked Nicki T if she saw her and Nicki T said yes. I asked why she was here and she said to help me. One of the first issues I began talking to Nicki T about was doing markdowns the correct way. I told her she had to do the items in the backroom as well. She wanted to know why and explained to her that was the only way for those things to be correctly priced when they went to the sales floor. As I was explaining this, I saw the section of the backroom where all baby products were stored. I remember seeing baby powder and Vaseline in particular but there was a long row of such products. We then went on to the way she is managing the sales associate Nicki T and the example she sets. She had been trying to keep Nicki T away from me. I reminded her that she is not the store manager, she cannot keep employees from me, and she must set a good example for the staff. She gave me the look she always does when she gets an attitude and said something but I don't know what. I asked the angel how I was doing and she said fine, patted me on the arm, and smiled reassuringly. Four new people appeared. A man, women, a girl, and a boy. I did not know them and asked them who they were. They, too, said they were angels there to offer me their support. They patted me on the shoulder and then said hello to the other angel touching her on the shoulder. They remained standing directly behind me and the other angel. I asked Nicki T if she saw them and she said yes. Someone else walked by and I asked them the same thing and they said yes. I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn't just seeing them because I wanted to. I ended my conversation with Nicki T by saying I wasn't going to put up with anymore. I told her that even though it might make my life much more difficult at least temporarily that the next time she screwed around with policy I would terminate her. She acted as though she didn't believe me and I told her she better, because I would. She left the room. I turned to the first angel, the others were now gone though I don't remember them leaving. I asked the angel how she thought I did and she said I did the right thing and I had done fine. I asked her how God thought I did. She said I didn't need him to tell me that. I said but I want to know that he thinks I did the right thing. She said she would ask him, she closed her eyes, within seconds she had a smile on her face. Then she chuckled a little. When she opened her eyes, she said he wants me to ask when I need help but other than that, I don't need his constant reassurance on matters like this. After this was over, I called my friend Jennifer K to tell her about my angel experience. I was so excited that I had an angel encounter. We talked about it a bit but I don't remember any of it. The next thing I knew I was in a large office, supposedly of the company where I work but the surroundings were not familiar to me. A lawyer approached me and said he was representing the sales associate Nicki T. I told him he would have to wait for a few minutes before I spoke to him. I knew I needed to try to get in touch with a company representative before talking to an attorney. I remember asking some of the office workers why Nicki T would need or want an attorney and what were going on because I didn't feel that I knew what was going on. None of them knew what had happened that she would have an attorney either. We were trying unsuccessfully to find a corporate person to give me approval to talk with the attorney or to provide our own attorney. Nicki T's attorney asked me why I felt I needed an attorney present to talk with him. I replied that it was not wise for me to speak with an attorney regarding company business without consulting our own company attorney first. As I was looking for our company attorney or human resource person or someone I said perhaps I should go to the sister company office next door and see if someone there could help. The office staff at my office did not know whom I would talk to there so they were trying to find out. While I was waiting, I went into one of the back offices. There were quite a few other people in this room. I was told that everyone in there was being punished by being put on a game show. One of the people in the room was actor/director Ron Howard. He had put on several different costumes and was required to do comedy routines in each one. He was with two other people in each of these routines. The final routine each of the two people he was with was required to light a huge firecracker of sorts. One person lit his on the top and it sparked a bit and then fizzled. The other lit his from the bottom and it shot off into the air. Someone said that is what you were supposed to do with them, so the first guy lit his at the bottom and it took off into the air. Both firecrackers were flying around the office in and out of hallways and doors. I crouched to the floor to avoid being hit. Someone said that was the whole purpose of lighting them, to avoid being hit by them."
"0023"	"(1999-01-17)"	"My mother and my son had both said some things about John Davidson, unpleasant and untrue, and they had started to spread as rumors. One of them, the one my son said, had actually been printed as a headline in a newspaper. John was in our town one day and so we told them they had to talk with him and tell him what they said, that they were responsible for it and to apologize to him. My mother did it. My son also did it. He said he wanted me to be with him when he did. Shortly after, I saw him sitting down at a table with John so I went over to join them. When I got there all of the seats were taken by many of Matthew's friends and John. I asked Matthew if he still wanted me there. He said, well, since I didn't ask you to be here in the first place. He started laughing and looking at his friends. I slapped his check, not too hard but hard enough to sting. I told him that's what he gets for lying and I walked away. I was walking through the town looking at the houses as I walked. I came upon several houses that had black wrought iron shelves on the back outside walls. They were on rollers, kind of like the roller ladders you see by high library shelves. I was commenting on how much I liked those. I was thinking about buying one of those houses. I heard that John was interested in this particular house. I remember thinking that perhaps John and I would get together then. Somebody standing near me asked me if I had seen the fifth floor of the house. I remember looking up at it for the first time and counting the floors. I only saw four so I thought it must have a basement. They took me inside to show me the fifth floor. When I went inside to see the fifth floor, I was suddenly a teenage girl accompanied by my mother and a girl friend. As we went through the house I noticed how old it was, and that it needed a lot of remodeling but I thought how fun that would be. I also noticed the floors were all hardwood and in very bad shape. I thought about the stripping and refinishing that would be needed. When we came to the fifth floor, there were two rooms. The first room was a nicely decorated dining room. It seemed as though there might be a kitchen off the dining room, but I did not see it. The table was set for a meal and in fact there were two people sitting getting ready to eat and they had food on their plates. A third person emerged through a door with more food, perhaps a turkey. It seemed as though they were preparing to celebrate a holiday meal and that they were expecting us for dinner. They asked us to join them. The person who emerged with the food was a blonde, pretty woman perhaps in her early 40's. The next thing I know, we are still in the house. I see the housekeeper, a black, heavyset woman, looking very sad as though she will not be needed here any longer. The next thing I see she is putting two children to bed. She is lying in bed with them to tell them a bedtime story. The one child is very small, perhaps one year old or less. The other appears to perhaps be near the age of three. At this moment, I get the sense that I am the older child, though I am watching this happen and I am still in the same house. We then go to see the other room of the fifth floor of this house. There is nothing in the room except a ladder that leads to a very dark area, maybe another room or attic? My girlfriend and I are alone so we decide to climb the ladder and see what is up there. I don't know how we manage but we seem to both be near the top of the ladder looking into this area. It is indeed an attic. It has a lot of stuff in there that we think looks so cool! There is something almost right in front of us that is covered by a cloth. We remove the cloth and are startled to find it is a very small gorilla, about the size of a monkey. The gorilla only moves slightly, looks directly at us, but makes no sound. We cover it again quickly. We debate whether we should go into the attic and look around. We think we shouldn't but we go anyway. We are too curious and really want to look at some of this cool stuff up here. We are now walking through several rooms of the house talking about what it would cost to redecorate and how we can come up with a budget. I am wondering how I would go about this. I want to have a decorator come in. I am still with my girlfriend. We are making a list of what we would need to do in each room. Wallpaper, curtains, wall plate covers, paint, throw pillows, and bedspreads. We go into another room and do the same thing. One room had a bed in it that had a bedspread on it. There may have actually been two beds. I also saw some baskets and throw pillows that I liked but I thought they were the wrong color. They are what prompted me to add throw pillows to the list for redecorating. The baskets were somewhat attached to the throw pillows and I saw some type of rings or large hoops, also attached. We are back in the attic now, looking at things from two perspectives. One was just the curiosity of seeing what was there and the other perspective was to see if there were things that we could use in the house when we redecorate. I found this straw purse. I'm not sure it was a purse. I commented that it would be really neat to have on a dresser and have scarves flowing out of it. My girlfriend told me to go for it. I can't remember much else of what we found. There were many cats around. I remember thinking of my allergy to cats but it did not bother me enough to make me leave. The last thing we found was a book about three people. I think they were trapeze artists or perhaps circus performers. They were two men and a woman. The woman was in the middle of the picture. We wondered if the woman in the picture was the owner of the house. Just at that time, my mother was at the bottom of the ladder telling us we shouldn't be up there and especially not going through those things. As she was reprimanding us, the owner of the house appeared. She didn't seem particularly upset that we were up there. She seemed somewhat sad, and that she wanted to explain some things to us. I get the feeling that she was going to tell us that she was in fact that woman, that the gorilla was a gift/reminder of that time, and that she just couldn't bear to part with it because of that. I also get some sense that the gorilla was in this attic and covered up because if anyone found out she had it, it would be taken away by the zoo or some such authority. I also some sense of something about her feeding it everyday."
"0024"	"(1999-06-12)"	"I was with someone in a store kind of like a Kmart. I don't know who I was with but they were shopping in a different part of the store. I was looking for plastic storage containers. I wanted to see how much they were or if they were on sale. When I got to the aisle where the storage containers were they were many sale signs hanging by them on the back wall of the shelving unit. I remember seeing one that made me think they were on sale for $5 and some cents. The signs were hanging next to the containers rather than in front of or over or under the containers, as would normally be the case in a store. There were actually no products for sale under or over the signs. I remember thinking this is a great price. The containers were clear, frosted kind of look, with blue lids. They were rather large, like 5 gallon size perhaps but rectangular. I decided to look more closely at the signs and realized that all of the sale signs were for personal care products that weren't even in that aisle. They were hanging in layers on top of each other but maybe four or five across also. I thought to myself, ah, the employee who was supposed to hang these probably didn't want to do it so hung them all here just to say the job was done. I went to find a manager to tell them about it. I found a young man, though I don't know if he was a manager or not, and told him about the signs. I walked back to the location with him. When we got there, an employee had just finished filling that spot with Tampons. I get a sense that he put the tampons there but I'm not sure. The tampons were piled so high that they hid the sale signs completely. The man I brought back to show them to somehow looked behind the tampons and saw the signs. As I walked away, he was using a hammer to loosen the shelf above the tampons/containers/signs. I thought that he was doing that so he could get to the signs to remove them. The next thing I remember is that I was still in the same store but I was looking at clothing. As I was looking, I encountered a woman acquaintance. I say acquaintance because I don't know who she was. I get the sense that she was someone that I was not particularly fond of. I chatted with her a bit; she was just standing around waiting for someone she was with who was shopping. I selected a few items and went to the dressing room to try them on. As I returned from the dressing room, I went by the men's dressing rooms. They were all full. While I could not see any of the men in the room, I got the sense that one man was completely naked and I could see pubic hair, nothing else. I felt embarrassed and tried to hurry by. Some men looked at me as though they thought I worked here. I remember thinking to myself that I have spent too much time working in retail, because my past work in retail affects my shopping experiences, related to things like the sale signs. Now these men think I work here. They were trying on sports coats. I commented to both of them that they looked great. They were both black men. The one seemed very happy that I told him he looked great. He said something to the other man as I walked away. I don't know what he said. I went back to where I got the clothes I had just tried on. The woman acquaintance was still there. She was kind of leaning on a circular rack full of clothing. I approached her again; I think to put the clothes back that I had just tried on. She was standing so close to the rack that she was somewhat in between the clothes on the rack. I started talking with her again. It seems that we were talking about a mutual acquaintance. I don't really remember, except that she made some comment about alcoholism and I asked her if she was an alcoholic. She said yes. I am now walking around the store pushing a shopping cart and at the same time trying to carry a large metal ladder. I can't remember why I had the ladder. It also seems to me that there was nothing in the shopping cart. I have been called to the manager's office. When I walk in there are two male management members and one female. I remember nothing about the female. The one male did all of the talking and the other male, who seemed to be his superior kept fidgeting in his chair and turning his back to me through the whole conversation. The male who did all of the talking was the actor who used to play Judge Harry Stone on night court. He began by saying they wanted to discuss a few things with me. They handed me a list and began to go over the list. The list was typed on rather dark, brown, very heavy stock paper. I wondered to myself why they had chosen this because you could hardly read what was typed on it. The first things they discussed were very general and did not appear odd to me. I was cordial and making light, comments to evoke smiles or chuckles as the conversation began. They said they had been watching me on camera that afternoon. I think that it was at this point that I determined that they were terminating my employment. I looked at Harry and said, you are accusing me of stealing aren't you. He said, you bet we are! I realized we all had the brown pages and they were in a binder with a rather large number of other pages though the others were all white. I told him I wanted him to put that in writing, on one of the white pages. He said gladly. He and I started flipping through the white pages. It was as though he wanted to pick a certain page to write it on. I didn't care; I just wanted it in writing. I was so very angry. I had stood up at this point and was talking very loudly and angrily at him while pointing to the book and asking him to put that in writing."
"0025"	"(1999-08-23)"	"I was Robin Williams. All three of the children from the movie were there and they were my children. We were riding in an airplane. I don't know why. We were in something like a cargo compartment where we couldn't see the pilot. The pilot may have been flying us down, but I'm not sure. We were all holding on trying to help. It was as if the plane wasn't going to make it all the way over. So we tilted to one side to help the plane go over. As it started to go over, we ran to the other side to help it balance. I don't know what happened. The older daughter and I were outside the airplane. There like bars on the outside that we were hanging onto. I remember having a real close look at the feet of the older daughter. She spent her time putting her feet in a place where she would be able to keep holding on. I realize I am somewhere else, and all three of the children have died in that flight. Somehow, I survived. It was just killing me. I was just dying inside. There was this conveyor belt. All of the children's clothes are coming down a conveyor belt all clean and pressed. clothes that they had on in their accident. It's just killing me that they all died. I just thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from the pain. It hurt so badly. The next thing I know I'm in my house and I'm myself again. A friend of mine from high school, Freda L, showed up. She came in my house. She was holding something like a postcard like the ones sent out for Tupperware parties and such. I guess I was having some kind of party like that or selling something like that. It wasn't Tupperware but I don't know exactly what it was. Freda L had come over to give me her order. There is a bunch of people around but I don't know why and I don't know any of them. I don't know if they were all women or if they were both men and women. We went outside and there were people outside too. Some of them were in water. It seemed to be more like a pond than a swimming pool. At that point, it seems that the people were both men and women. Freda L was in the pond now. I asked her if I told her about Darren. She said, no. I told her that he died last week. She went under water and didn't come back up. She was okay. She was under water because she was crying and didn't want anyone to see her. Then, another high school friend, Dorothea D, was there. She wanted to know what was wrong with Freda L. Someone said to her that Anna told her that Darren died last week. Dorothea D said, do you mean the Darren that used to be on Bewitched? I said no, my Darren. Many people were very sad, and so shocked by the news. All I could think about was how terrible I felt about my children dying. I was in so much pain over losing my children. I was having a conversation with God. He assured me that they spent a few seconds being very, very scared but that he went to them and he talked to them, answered their questions, and gave them comfort. They died on impact so they didn't feel any pain. Because he went to them and answered their questions, they weren't scared anymore. While we were having this conversation, I was starting to wash down the inside walls of this baggage compartment or whatever it was that we were in. I was trying to make it all smooth. It was black. There was all this water in it. I think the plane crashed into the water and they died. I don't know why I didn't or how I got out of it. I had like a rag or sponge and dipping into the water and then without wringing it out I would take it to the top of this wall and wash this wall down where it would be smooth and black with no marks on it. I wasn't successful. I just kept doing it. There kept being streaks."
"0026"	"(1999-08-23)"	"Matthew was spending the night with Michael A and Theresa Ah. I don't know why he was spending the night with them. She asked me to watch their baby. They had a baby about 4-5 years ago, shortly before we saw them the last time. I told them I would watch the baby for them. I put her in the front seat of the car with me. I didn't have a child car seat. I just sat her up in the seat. I think she was maybe less than but close to a year old. I buckled her in under the seat belt. Theresa Ah seemed to think that was fine. She didn't say anything about it anyway. Now I am walking somewhere, to my destination, but I don't know where that was. I still have the baby, but I have her in something like a lunch bag. I don't think I am carrying anything else. For some reason I am coming down a back road. As I am coming down this back road there is a car headed right straight at me. It's driving on the wrong side of the road. They don't have their headlights on. Eventually I can get over and it misses me. I see that it is a very beat up police car. I keep going and the same thing happens again. Only this time the lights are on, on the other car. It's another police car, but this time it isn't banged up. The next thing I know I'm still headed for my destination but now I'm walking. As I turn this bend, 5-6 men in black jump out. They are in kind of a six-sided formation; I don't know exactly how to explain it. They are all in black and they all have guns. They take a pose, kind of like something you would see in a movie. It scared me. I turned around and tried to walk as fast as I could the other way. I didn't want to run because I didn't want to scare the baby. I didn't want to hurt the baby. The men quickly overtake me. There are police officers who tell me that there are terrorists, out there that they are trying to capture. They escort me to a main section where I can walk. They tell me that I should be fine as long as I stay in this main area. It's a very public area, kind of like walking along an outdoor mall. As I'm walking I keep coming to these cement ponds. They have small cement strips that you can walk on very carefully to get around the water parts without going out to a main street or anything. I'm walking along these strips, I see some bushes or something like that, and I meet two young girls coming the other way. I very carefully manage to pass them. I keep going and then I meet these girls again. This is odd because I thought they were going the other way before. I manage to catch just a part of their conversation. One of them is trying to decide whether to go to college or whether to work. I see as I go by one of them that there is a very small evergreen tree in a big cement flowerpot. I see falling through that, by these girls, something that looks like a tampon. I keep walking and I come to a place where there are these rooms. There is this couch, some furniture sitting outside one of the rooms. This couch is turned with its back towards me. There is a man sitting in the couch. It is James C. I know Brandy C is inside. I don't know why I know it but I do. There is a chair facing the couch, on the outside also, and Matthew is sitting in there. I don't know why he is with them or how he got there. I said something to James C about gunmen. I said that no, they said we would be safe as long as we stayed on these main streets. Matthew didn't say anything. He was sitting there with one leg over the arm of the chair and reading a magazine. I don't know where I am or who I'm talking to. I'm telling some people about the gunmen. I was reassuring them. They were concerned about the safety of the baby. I opened the lunchbox to the show them and myself that she is okay. I told them what the police said and that they assured us that we should be fine as long as we stayed on these main streets. I continue trying to reassure them that we are safe where we are but they don't want to believe me. They want to take off running because this helicopter is hovering overhead. They are telling us that as long as we stay in the general area where we are we will be fine. These people were panicking. They were running all over the place trying to get out. Now, I'm in this room. It almost seems like an overhead, some kind of a room where you can look out and down out these glass windows. I'm feeling calm and safe because the police told me that if we stayed there we would be safe. However, there are all these other people inside and out, running all over in a panic. There are many people milling around. Everyone is calm down. The baby is fine. I'm not worried about her. All of a sudden, I see something like a baseball record, or being safe, like 5 out of 6 times. For some reason the ration seems like 60 out of 1. The father of this baby comes up to me. It looks like he is discussing with the same person that I am standing with about our safety. I try to reassure him that we are perfectly safe where we are. He doesn't seem to want to go for it. He wants some kind of lessons now on protecting himself. I don't know what kind of lessons. They are trying to reassure us. They have some kind of a metal that's digging into me because of being six and one. I tell him he could use the same thing, but he is too panicked and wants to run. All the while, I know that the baby is safe. We were in front of my apartment here. I don't know if I have the baby with me or not. I'm putting something in the back seat of the car. I'm still assuring whoever is with me that we are going to be safe. I notice a water bottle in the back seat of the car. I think I want to get it out. I don't want them to have that."
"0027"	"(1999-09-01)"	"I was driving somewhere. I don't remember where. I was driving around. I drove into a mall parking lot. I was blocked by a truck that was unloading for The Shoe Store. It had the parking lot and driving area all blocked with a huge thing that was attached to the store and to the truck. I don't know how to explain what it was. Some kind of a conveyor belt for them to unload the shoes from the truck into the store. I was debated how to get where I was going then. All of a sudden, they must have been done, because this huge thing started deflating. It started to collapse. It started to go in, like starting at one end and moving towards the store as it deflated. There was nothing under it as it deflated. It just deflated little by little until it was gone or was done deflating. All that was left was like these robot things that were running towards the store. It seems that maybe the robots had been controlling it or were doing something for the store but I don't know what it was. There is something, not sure they are robots, but something with headphones. There was something about Gale W. She died. It was as if I was there to work. I grabbed some headsets. I was playing around with it. Moving it around to adjust it to fit me."
"0028"	"(1999-09-12)"	"I was a manager at a type of retail store like a Wal-Mart. I opened up some new packages of different kinds of chewing gums. In one box that I opened, there were six or eight different kinds. After I opened them, I realized that we really didn't need them at the register. I put them there anyway. I remember thinking how good they smelled. I realized that they were different from the ones that were sitting there; the ones that I thought I was going to be refilling or replacing. That's why I decided to just put them there anyway. The cashiers needed some help with some money. I went down. I thought I'd do my part. I'll work my Saturday. I'll work my shift. No extra. As part of the management team, I'll do my part. I'll work my Saturday. The next thing I know I am at GC. I'm sitting in a room in a circle with some other students and people who work there. I was thinking that I've graduated but I'm waiting to hear the assignments of who our student advisor is. Our student advisor is another student who is further along in his or her studies than we are. I'm sitting thinking that I would be one of those advisors, yet I'm sitting there waiting to here who mine is going to be. There are a few that people are really hoping to be assigned to. I'm confused as to whether I am one of those or if I am eager to get one of those people. I go to Terry K and explain to him that I am not going to be there as a student. What I will actually being doing during that time is working on the preparation work or whatever I need to do to present my dissertation idea and asked him if I really need to be there for that. He said he found the campus to be a wonderful, meditative getaway spot for him when he was doing that. He came there simply for that reason because it was such a great place to be to do that type of work. He found it very productive and beneficial. He was able to get a lot done there. I thought that made sense. I remember thinking right away about the money, how much money it would be. I would be paying $1500 for residency."
"0029"	"(1999-10-10)"	"I'm not even sure I was asleep yet. I was walking outdoors. I had a trench coat on and I got down near the ground by a puddle to look into the water but I stuck my face in the water."
"0030"	"(1999-10-28)"	"I believe I was a teacher. I took a group of teenagers, along with another adult that I was working with, to some building. We went inside the building. It was a mess. It was dirty and rundown. There was little if anything inside the large room that we were in. I said this would be great. It seemed to be perfect for whatever we wanted it for. At that time, I don't know that I knew what we were looking for. The teens were complaining and such. We went to work cleaning it up and trying to make it usable. I came back into the room and the teens had done a great job fixing it up. There was furniture, pictures hanging on the walls, etc. I took a microphone and told them how very proud I was of them. I told them that I remembered what it was like to be their age, young, afraid, no one to talk to. I told them to feel free to call me at home anytime if they needed someone to talk to. I then handed the microphone to the other adult but don't remember anything that person said. Finally, I told the teens there would be one rule about this room. That rule is confidentiality. Anything that is said in that room stays in that room. That way they would feel safe discussing anything in there."
"0031"	"(1999-10-28)"	"I was with three of the women from the Golden Girls, Blanche, Rose and Dorothy. I was working as a character in a theme park. This was no character that I recognize or have heard of before. I'm not even sure that I can describe it except that I was in water. Maybe I was some kind of sea witch, but not really a witch though. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what I was doing as that character. People were coming through the park. I was doing different things. I don't think I was scaring them. I can't even remember interacting with them. Most of my interaction was with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy. They seemed to be doing the same thing I was. They were characters. We came into the park as visitors though. We also visited a kind of church. It is a very different kind of church. We went in the church and there were no benches. There were folding chairs. There was like this platform. It was not really like a stage, more like a loft. There were musicians on the loft. The music was not rock and roll but something that would really appeal to young people today. Everyone in there really seemed to be enjoying the music. They passed a plate around for the collection and there was a comment about this kind of music really helping them to draw more people in and to get better collections. There is a large hallway outside. At that time, I realized that the hallway was filled with young people who were drawn in because of this music. They were getting ready to pass the plate around out there for a collection. They said something about this helping them to build the new church and maybe a school. They wanted to increase their collections so that they could build a new church, or school and a home for their priest. I don't know if it was a home for homeless girls, runaway girls. It was some kind of home for young girls."
"0032"	"(1999-11-05)"	"I was at the sleep center and had on an orange-colored wool suit. I didn't have the jacket on. I had a blouse on and the skirt. The skirt was huge. The skirt was way, way too big for me. I was running around trying to find a very big safety pin to try to pin it. I was showing everyone how big it was on me and we were getting ready for a research meeting. Now, I was looking in the cabinets and different things and I saw these front office things like labels. They were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. I wondered why they were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. Finally, someone handed me a large paper clip to hold my skirt. I tried it but it didn't work so I kept looking. I finally found a safety pin and I pinned it. About that time, I noticed Doctor W standing, kind of off in the distance, talking to some woman that I didn't know. I get the impression that she works there but I don't know who she is. Julie Ca was there. Anyway, Doctor W called me over and started telling me about a research study that we were going to be involved in and this woman was going to be involved in it. He told me in front of her that I really am not very knowledgeable about research and so she is going to be very involved in this study. We were in a conference room sitting at this table. All of a sudden, there were many people there. They were all strangers. There was no one else I knew. There is one lady that he had just told me was going to be heavily involved in the research study. I was sitting next to Doctor W. I was having a lot of trouble hearing the conversation. The study was going to be a drug study. Doctor W said something about me not saying anything, but he didn't say it to me. He said it to everybody else. Everybody started making fun of me. Saying things like, Oh Anna can't speak, and things like that. This initial woman that he told me was going to be very involved asked me something about the study. I said, Well, I don't know. I've never been involved in a drug study. Then Doctor W made some other comment that I thought was inappropriate. It was kind of a put down. I started to stand up to ask him to step outside the room with me because I was going to ask him not to berate me in front of other people. I half stood up, then changed my mind and said, well, for the purpose of this study, I'm just part of the research team, okay? Then I sat back down. The meeting continued. Again, I was having a very hard time hearing people. I was really straining to turn my head, really straining to hear what was being said. A couple other people came in the room to join the meeting. Someone said something about talking about something in particular and they were all joking and laughing and one lady said Oh no, no, not me."
"0033"	"(1999-11-13)"	"I was at someone's home. I believe I was with Margaret L, doing a Circle. Towards the end of the evening, as I was collecting the money, I realized that I was at Mike M's home. I was excited to finally see what he looks like. I found him attractive and that was reassuring. I asked him if he knew who I was and he said he did not. I did not reveal myself to him."
"0034"	"(1999-11-13)"	"I was with Mike M. There was another woman with us as well. She was a much larger woman than I was. Mike M and I were kissing and cuddling and the other woman was not necessarily watching but it was as though she was waiting to be included. I did not want to include her because of her size. As Mike M and I became more intimate, I became very self-conscious of my own size. Mike M kissed my stomach a couple of times and then got up and walked away. We got into a discussion about my weight. He thought it should be very easy for me to lose weight. I tried to explain to him everything I have tried and just how difficult weight loss is for me. He didn't really seem to understand it. As I was having this discussion I seemed to be seeing these pictures of myself at the same time but I'm not sure exactly how. He didn't see them. In each of these pictures, however I was dressed very scantily and provocatively. In a final one, I am dressed in a different, yet similar outfit that really shows my excess tummy weight. I am thinking to myself that I can't believe I did that. I can't believe my sisters saw this and I realize how awful it looked. I also was very disappointed in Mike M because he has told me in waking life that he doesn't care how heavy a woman is as long as he can get his arms around her."
"0035"	"(2000-01-15)"	"I was being chased. There were three men working in a kitchen or hotel. It was a huge room and there were many people around. They had on chef's aprons and hats. One of them must have been the head chef. The other two did something wrong that somehow was involved in me being caught and getting away. I don't know. The head chef made one of them drink a ladle full of dishwater."

"0037"	"(2000-01-27)"	"I was dreaming about dreaming. The word salad seems important but I don't know why. I had this image of a suspended bridge between; it seems like maybe two buildings. I don't know if I was standing on it or not. I was thinking about telepathic dreams and getting the message."

"0039"	"(2000-02-04)"	"I was playing cards in a very large room. I had a 69 and the flip was 69. There was a large group of players, 50 or more. The card was a king so I threw my hand away. Chris A was playing in the same room. I left my seat and the room was so crowded I could not find a new seat."
"0040"	"(2000-02-05)"	"Someone was after me, trying to kill me. I believe I was maybe at a college and I was going into a building that was maybe a women's dorm. I went inside and see maybe three or four people that they were trying to kill. First, I was outside and there were many women who were heading into the dorm. We heard shooting. Many of the women ducked to the ground on their knees and were praying. I did that too. I don't know how I made the transition to the inside. The next thing I know, it's as though I've been hung, but not killed yet. I'm suspended from the ceiling. I'm waiting for these people. I think I'm suspended with two or three other women. I can't see them but I have a sense that I was. I'm waiting for the people who want to kill me to come in. When they do, I start swinging, trying to attack them from whatever it was that was suspending me there. The next thing I know I'm no longer suspended. I'm free to roam. I still have this sense that they're trying to kill me. I'm in some lingerie or something but no bottoms on. One of the women that wants to kill me comes in the room and I ask her if she wants to fondle me, thinking that she won't want to kill me then. She says no and leaves. Then I plan how I'm going to get out of there before they come back. I don't remember actually making the plan just that I was going to plan to get out of there before they come back. I was doing some reading for a store report. I make a phone call to ask what I'm supposed to read as a resource to do this paper. I realized as soon as I asked that it was a dumb question because I knew what I was supposed to read. It was a one-page thing that I was supposed to read and then write a paper about it. I felt stupid for having asked. They said, yes, that's what I'm supposed to read to do this paper. Something to do with writing this and then using this writing to present something or teach something. I'm in a line of cars. The car in front of me doesn't have any break lights. We're on a winding hill. It's dark. I almost run into this car in front of me because they don't have any taillights. However, it was almost as though, even those these are cars in front of me, I wasn't in a car. I'm sliding out of control. I don't have the sense that I'm in a car. This seems to replay itself. I see the same thing happen again. I'm back in the dorm. Someone comes in. I say that I'm looking for someone and I say something about this writing essay. One woman chuckled and said, yeah, someone even wondered if that one page was in fact the only reading assignment to write the paper. She asked the rest, if that wasn't ridiculous. I said, well, in their defense, I wondered the same thing myself because it was such a short piece. It seemed that there was more that we needed to read to write the paper about."
"0041"	"(2000-02-08)"	"I was in a church setting but there was not room in the main hall. I found a table for my family with three chairs. There was some group next to me talking about someone from Anderson. I was nosey, but I realized that I didn't know the person they were talking of. For some reason I wadded up paper and threw it towards a basket. It fell on the floor and the people nearly where it fell looked at me. The music became very strong from the inside. I stood up and looked in. There were four young people playing the piano very hard and loud. Not church music. Someone named Walter Reeder, father-in-law, walked out and handed me an item to take care of, about the size of a shoebox. I didn't know what to do so I left to find other people with the same box to help me. After a long search and some problem crossing the street, I found some men to help. They forced credit cards into sliding slots of the box and a date came up. They said the date was a joke on the owner of the box as to how much money they paid to stay at a hotel. The was with a woman. The other part of the box was a , which was a ticket to the dance. Then Walt showed up and I gave the box back to him. I then left with two suitcases pulling them. One was mine and the other belonged to someone else."
"0042"	"(2000-02-08)"	"I was with some of my family at a carnival. It was raining and messy. We were talking about how every time we do something like that it rains. Saying yeah even the zoo and everything else. It always rains on us. I was there with members of my family. I remember Daddy specifically. Maybe Bob F and his family. They were not sitting with us, but sitting higher away from us. I was taking pictures but the battery on my camera went dead so the flash wasn't working. Daddy handed me another one to replace it. When I took the battery case off, the whole back came off and suddenly the camera was huge. There was someone else there helping me get the battery in, putting the battery cover back on, and then putting the back of the camera on. After I did that, it was a regular small camera again. I wanted to take a picture of these four people. They weren't family. It was two couples. I told them that they each needed to lean towards the middle so I could get them in one picture. I was still in the same place but it was as if I had two rolls of paper towels. I was asking someone about them or joking about them. I got up to leave and took one with me. I asked Bob F. He had his own roll of paper towels where he was sitting. I left one sit there and I took one with me."
"0043"	"(2000-02-08)"	"Doctors were doing something to alter patients minds. Noah Wyle, an actor on ER, had found out about something that some of his coworkers were doing that was very wrong. They cornered him and took him to this upstairs location kind of like a loft. They significantly injured him physically, though I don't get the sense that they beat him. It was like they had put some kind of cuffs or something around his wrists and ankles and caused severe abrasions that were about 2 inches wide all the way around on each ankle and wrist. He was bleeding a lot. Down the middle of his chest were severe abrasions. He tried to sneak down to the locker room so he could clean himself up. He was trying to hide it so know one would find out what they had done. He was doing this to protect himself because they had done this to threaten him so he wouldn't report them for what they had done. He was putting on his scrubs and he had tied a whole lot of medications for his injuries tied to a belt. He was trying to hide them under his scrubs. A nurse coming in for her shift happened to look in and saw all the medications. He was talking to someone. That person didn't notice but this nurse did. Before that, I was talking to a supervisor. I guess I worked there. She had told me to check an ad and see if some things were still on sale. I had to stand on a wall heater or something to be able to look at an ad that was posted on the wall. I don't remember what it said but I decided from looking at it that the stuff was not on sale any longer. I never did go back and tell her that. She also wanted me to put out some new things on a shelf. She instructed me that even though the boxes were very attractive that I was to take the things out of the boxes to display them. There was a section of shelves where we displayed over-the-counter medication for employees. We kept them in the boxes. She wanted to make sure that I took these out of the boxes to display them. I went by one area that there were all kinds of hair care. It was large bottles. They were all green. Doctor B came by. I didn't say anything to him. I don't remember any conversation or anything. I just had the sense that he was there. I didn't do anything with the hair care products."
"0044"	"(2000-02-26)"	"I was driving in a car with a friend and stopped at a big house on a hill. I was not welcomed and the people there started throwing snowballs at us. I turned around and left. I left so fast I almost hit another car. A police officer stopped me. He yelled in my face and treated me like a serious criminal. This continued for some time. I felt like I needed an attorney, although I didn't feel like it was as serious as the police officer made it out to be."
"0045"	"(2000-03-01)"	"I was a medical student though not true resident. I get the sense that I was working with sleep and dreams but that I had to do some time visiting with patients. Going on rounds. I was in a patient's room. It was a double room. They were getting ready to move in a new patient. The new patient was Kay H. She walked in wearing street clothes. She seemed fine, like there was no reason for her to be there. I don't know why she was being admitted. She talked to me a bit and was cheerful. She didn't say that anything was wrong or why she was being admitted. I was on my way somewhere else, so I told her I didn't have time to chat right now. I left. The next thing I know I'm with my fellow students and we're taking a break or relaxing, walking the grounds. I realized that there was a place to play tennis. I went by myself and was looking for a tennis ball. I was going to go. I don't know how I was going to play by myself, because I didn't have a partner. I went to look for a tennis ball. I climbed over a fence or something because I saw these balls and I thought they might be tennis balls. When I got there, they were croquet balls. Then I found this other thing. It was kind of like a small wood cabinet. It had many balls in it and so I started going through there to see if there was a tennis ball in there. There were some in there, but some of them were out of air, flat, some were very small. This young man walked up to me, started talking to me, and started going through there with me. I realized that he was there with another woman. He seemed to be interested in me or maybe just wanted to play tennis with me. I guess I all of a sudden realized that I was late for my rounds or for where I was supposed to be at the hospital. I took off running. I was jumping over things. It was somewhat humorous the way I was jumping over things. I can't remember any details of what it was that I was jumping over. I just remember I was making these huge leaps over things to try to get to the hospital on time. I got to my room and I grabbed my white lab coat and put my shoes on. I had been barefoot. I put my shoes and socks on. I said oh my gosh, I still have to go find a stethoscope. I ran to the hospital and went to this one room. There were many different kinds of stethoscopes and other things hanging in rows from the ceiling. There were many different colors. I grabbed a stethoscope and something else and put the stethoscope around my neck. I had a clipboard or notebook and went to find someone. I said I know I'm very late and I'm sorry. I don't know where I'm supposed to be. I'm looking for someone who can tell me where I'm supposed to be."

It was outrageous to me. There were three items and two seemed reasonable but the third was excessive. I talked to the repair man about this. He showed me a part that seemed like a simple plug. I did not pay the bill but said I would contact the owners. I asked if labor was included and he said no. The repair man had been to the house before."

I thought I saw her several streets away but I had a sense that she either didn't see me or didn't know who I was. She was in a rust-colored SUV. The next thing I know Barry C was back from Henry's and we are in Patty U's house. not her waking life house. I told him she was trying to find me. She didn't want to physically hurt me but rather hurt me with verbal outrage, confrontation, and questions. I was trying to find ways to quickly escape if I needed to. There was a row of windows with miniblinds on them. They were all locked. I finally found one that wasn't locked. Barry C and I opened it partially so if I needed to I could quickly open it the rest of the way and escape. We went outdoors and discussed my staying out there. For some reason we talked about my answering the phone but decided that was too risky. I finally decided to drive into town, rent a room, and then try to find the University to use a phone and to walk."

When it was over, I apologized to him that he had to sit around and wait on me for so long. I was concerned about him being bored or getting upset. He said, I told you it would be fine and it was. Oddly, I was now in bed. He was standing next to the bed, leaned over, and kissed me. We had a brief discussion about what to do about us. My feelings were very ambivalent. I think even more so than my feelings about Barry C. I said something about telling different people, hinting, or insinuating something about their reactions. I then said, what about. He interrupted before I could finish my sentence, saying Mother and Daddy. I finished the sentence, saying, Darren and Kay H. We were talking about the same people. I don't know why he called them Mom and Daddy. The next scene we were in a kitchen. There was stuff all over the counters. There was an old box of Frosted Mini-Wheat's on the counter, the bite size kind that I eat. I got a new box out of the cabinet. They were the larger ones. As I was pouring them into a bowl, the milk was already in the bowl. He was eating the old ones from his hand. He asked about the difference and I told him the ones he was eating weren't good anymore. He asked me if you are supposed to put them in a bowl of milk. I then got ready to add raisins to it. I told him that I always like to put raisins in my cereal."

I don't remember if we/I was going to purchase or rent. We were driving by the condo and I wanted to stop and look at it again but we decided we could on the way back from wherever we were going because we had to come back for Matthew before we left to drive back to our home state. We were headed to a meeting. When I arrived at the meeting with a female business partner, Bill F was not around. We were the two principal executives of a multi-million dollar company. It had something to do with hair salons. The place where we were meeting was a very large hair salon. Someone was showing us around and introducing us to everyone. I think my partner and I were buying the salon or taking it over. I'm not sure which. One of the women that was working there was wearing an apron. It said something like I do shampooing or some such. I said I wanted one like it, even though I wouldn't wear it. David Letterman was at the meeting. He was telling me that he had invited someone to dinner and she was very reluctant to go with him. I told him he could invite me or me and my partner anytime and we would be there."

I went upstairs, but had to step around food sitting on the steps. I thought I should go offer to help with the party prep. That it would be the right thing to do. People were beginning to arrive. They were talking about Suzie G's meringue. It was in a huge, trash-bag-size pastry bag. Later I went into the kitchen and Suzie was there. Something had happened to her meringue. It was out of the bag, in the sink, and piled high above the top of the sink. I told her I had eggs for her to make more."

The man had a stocky build, was balding, grey curly hair, very nice, wore one of those felt, flat type of a hat, but not a beret. He was being very supportive and kind about this being Matthew's first time. When he was done, I gave him a thumb's up, though I didn't think Matthew had done a very good job. As the man was leaving, I tried to find Matthew to see if he would be hurt if I fixed it up a bit for the man but I couldn't find Matthew. I went ahead and ran out to the driveway to make the offer to the man anyway. I had still been in bed and had on a short, spaghetti-strap nightgown. I stood by the man's care with my arms folded across my breasts for this reason. He took me up on my offer and continued to be very kind about the whole situation. I asked the man if he ever thought about shaving the top where he had alot stray hair. I started fixing the rest."

I was kind of running around with this huge chef's knife covered with blood and trying to figure out what to do with it. I also have a sense that I wanted to stay away from the person now. People started showing up at my house for a party. When one man showed up, I realized he was the father of the killer. It made me very uncomfortable. I didn't want him there either. He was a very large man, maybe 6 feet tall and 300+ pounds. He was very rough looking, and had a salt and pepper beard. He brought a bunch of very large fish with him. They were on a string as though he had just recently caught them."

We were having a good time, though it was nothing sexual. Some of the men friends with us came to our room. I decided to go into another room and study for a little while. I had books and papers spread out all over a chair with ottoman, like my black leather on in the living room. I decided it was time to stop studying and get ready to go because we were all going out. I started my shower and got out to get something. When I did, I realized that a couple of the men were waiting to use our bathroom so they could also get ready. I took one of them to our other bathroom so he could use it. The next thing I know I am in the shower and Tom Cu and one of the other men come in the bathroom with me to start getting ready. Tom Cu is upset because Mary Cu said we're all going to be late now. It was my fault because I had waited too long to start getting ready and then tied up the bathroom. I apologized. I got the sense that he wasn't going to stay mad very long. Still, I said, I'm sorry Rick with kind of an attitude. I don't know why I called him Rick. Later, I thought I should have told him that everyone could go without me and I would stay, study, and watch TV."

Father Nick was the presiding priest but there was another priest there as well. It was the main actor from the recent movie about the tobacco industry. My view was obstructed and I looked around whatever the obstruction was to see that priest. I had a sense that the other priest wasn't there or was upset. When I did see him, there didn't seem to be anything wrong. I thought he might be slouching in his seat but he wasn't. After Mass, I was speaking with Rosalie C. I used the wrong cloth to wipe out a wine cup and left a wet spot on it. Rosalie C pointed out the right cloth to use. She picked up the one I had used and noticed the wet spot. I could tell by her facial expression that she was perturbed. I stayed for Noon Mass. Shortly after Mass began I wondered why I had stayed and made plans to leave the next time everyone was standing"

I think this town was one I passed thorough on my way home. I was trying to get to 91st and A1 Road to the west of my home. This town didn't have a 91st St. This doesn't make sense now, but as I was looking for 91st St I saw 92nd and then 101st St. That's when I realized that they didn't have a 91st St. I saw a man on a street. First, I had asked some kids for directions, but their directions didn't make sense to me. Then I asked the man. carrying a duffel bag. He started to tell me one way to get there, but stopped and gave me different directions. He said this was a strange route but the best one. I would go down these steps, the path would go to the left, then I would take the fourth right. That would take me to A1 Road I was looking for. I didn't ask him why it was odd, but repeated the directions back to him to be sure I had it correct. I started on the path, took the left bend, and was faced with a brick door. I pushed the brick door open only to be faced with a few stairs leading up to another door, but that one wouldn't open. I became a bit frightened that I would be trapped so I turned around to go back and get out. When trying to go back I was faced with several of these brick doors. Each time I became a little more panicky that it wouldn't open. I finally got to the steps. At the top of the steps, boards had been nailed sporadically across the opening. I don't remember them being there when I started. There was an opening large enough for me to get out. I ran into the kids again. They couldn't believe he told me to go through the , don't remember what they called it.] They said that if I waited they would just take me to 91st and A1. They checked with their parents and then we left. Before I met the boys or the man the first time, some of the paths I was walking were covered with snow and ice. I was moving my feet and legs as if I was ice-skating but I didn't have skates on. The path was just slick enough that I could skate with my shoes. While the boys were showing me the way, we came to an ice skating rink. The man and his wife were with us now. As we were going in we all got bagels to eat, with different things on them. They told me to just take some of it with me and leave the rest in this little cubbyhole. It was a shelf that reminds me of corporate mailboxes. They each put theirs in one of the cubbies. One boy said especially ones like his because he had icing on his. I didn't do it. I took all of mine with me. We weren't going to skate. just watch. There weren't many people in the stands. Everyone had his or her bagels and a drink sitting on the bleacher seat in front of them. I sat on a row where everyone else had their bagel and drink and I sat mine behind me on a row where others were sitting. I finally said it was time for me to start the rest of the way home. The man and woman were surprised that I would continue to walk. It was dark now and they insisted on driving me. They asked where I lived and assured me it was not an inconvenience. The boys wanted to ride along. The man and his wife said that they would need to get a paper and pen and write down their parent's phone numbers so they could call first and make sure it was okay."

I don't know if we were trying to get away from someone or trying to accomplish something. I don't recall any particularly bad feelings. We had docked and someone was handing me furniture and other things to put on the ship. Without their knowledge, I was just throwing the things off the other side.

"0087"	"(2000-06-02)"	"I went to what seemed to be the SVSC though it didn't look like it does in waking life. I'm fairly sure that's where I was. When I arrived, Doctor Bl was in the driveway. I said hello. He smiled and was very warm and friendly as always. He seemed to be doing something that prompted me to ask him if he needed help but he said no. I went inside. I came back outside. Doctor Bl was still there. I think that maybe he was changing a tire on his car. I didn't ask if he needed help, but I looked carefully to see what/how he was doing to try to reassure myself that he didn't need help or that I shouldn't ask before going on. I did say good-bye to him. The driveway was black gravel. As went out into the road, I was traveling by foot. I stood. on purpose. on a crucifix. I was barefoot. I was using the crucifix to slide along the road. almost like a skateboard but the crucifix was smaller than my foot. In fact, I wonder how it worked because it seems that my foot would have grazed the pavement. The pavement of the road was black. maybe asphalt. Anyway, the crucifix worked well for the reason that I was using it. As I was moving along, I came to a hill. I didn't stop. I gave myself a last, hard push and started sailing down the hill. As I started down, I realized the trees almost came together as they branched over the pavement and made it very dark.I couldn't see anything except the tree branches and pitch, black darkness. I was gaining speed as I sped down the hill. There was a part of me that thought I should stop or at the very least slow myself to a very, very slow pace since I couldn't see what I was sailing into or didn't know what as at the other end of the hill. I decided to just keep going. I think I sensed that it would be okay. The road ended abruptly into a grassy pasture. The grass was a beautiful green. The pasture was perhaps 4 acres or more. There were many animals. different kinds. Immediately after I found myself kind of dumped into this grassy area, two horses charged me. They were solid black and beautiful. I didn't run or try to get away from them. I felt slightly fearful at first but then decided to just stand there. I don't remember if I did that because I didn't think they would hurt me or if I thought it would be best or if I just decided to stand still and see what happened. As the horses neared me, they ran aside rather than into me. I turned around a bit, viewing the pasture. It was very beautiful. Soon other groups of animals started charging me, but they all did the same thing as the first two horses. There were pigs and rabbits. One of the groups of rabbits that charged me there were 4-5 rabbits. Soon a large group of horses charged me. This time I was frightened and ran away from them. There were a number of buildings on the far edge of the pasture. That's where I headed when I began to run. I can't recall exactly what all the buildings were. I don't remember specifically a house, a barn, etc. I may be missing some details here. When I was around these buildings, I was with some man that I don't know. I don't recall having any interaction with him, unless it was just a few words. I'm fairly sure I didn't know him. I met a woman. She said something to me as if she knew me. I don't remember what she said. Whatever she said made me realize she was Patty U. However, this woman was tall, and Patty U is only one inch taller than I am. Anyway, I also recognized her dislike of me. I wanted to defend myself but didn't. I wondered how she knew who I was but thought that Barry C must have shown her pictures of me. I thought that was odd but also didn't like it that he had. As I was walking. alone now.I came across Barry C. He was very unpleasant towards me. I don't remember much of what he said to me. I said to him just because I want to have sex, you think I want to have children? I think I assured him that I did not. After telling him that, his attitude seemed to change, but he didn't speak again. I sensed that he wanted us to try again to be together. I walked away. I think I was headed home. This is odd because Barry C lives in CHV. As I was walking along the road, I came across another man who gave me directions and suggested I attend a single's event in town. I realized that I was in CHV and wondered if I wanted to meet someone else so far away. I think I decided to go ahead and stop by and just see what it was like."

I felt bad that we were stealing but ate the sandwich anyway because I was very hungry. This time I was with a different man. The other 2 people I was with before shot and killed four people in this building because they had found us there when we weren't supposed to be there. This other man and I were trying to escape over some hills. I kept thinking that even though I didn't kill the people I was guilty by association."

I went in to various rooms looking for him. I found four radios and lights that he had left on but he wasn't around. I went out to the porch. There were five or six small children playing with the water hose on the driveway. They were sprinkling each other and had a makeshift water slide. I thought Matthew was with them but when I approached, they dropped the hose and ran away. Matthew wasn't there. There was a pipe protruding from the ground. It had a plastic piece on the end with a kind of screen/filter in it. The diameter was about the size of a quarter. I heard Matthew's voice coming from the pipe. I cupped my hands around the pipe and spoke into it saying, Matthew H, you need to come home right now. I knew he would be embarrassed in front of his friends. I didn't know how else to tell him to come home. I went back inside and lay down on the bed. The radio was on. I felt guilty because there was so much I needed to do. I thought about my prior conversation with Matthew, about how he spends so much time lying around watching TV or playing video games instead of doing other things that he would enjoy more."

"0091"	"(2000-06-19)"	"I dreamed that I was dreaming. Barry C was there via an OBE. He was lying in bed with me in the spoon position. I was talking to him, telling him how real it felt. He was holding me very tightly. I kept trying to snuggle even closer."
"0092"	"(2000-06-19)"	"Barry C called to tell me that they were going to get married. I said you and Patty U. He didn't answer me, but I knew from his response or lack of that I was right."
"0093"	"(2000-06-22)"	"I was at a sleep conference in Las Vegas."
"0094"	"(2000-06-23)"	"I was preparing to do a lecture. For some reason Ann B was involved. People were arriving at my house and I wasn't ready."
"0095"	"(2000-06-24)"	"I was at NTNS talking to Jane H and Janet S. I was speaking mostly with Jane H as usual. Jane H was pricing some things to put on the sales floor and Janet S was helping customers. I asked Jane H about her daughter's wedding. She said it is in one week. I asked how Angie Ha is doing and she said fine. I asked about her soon to be son-in-law. She told me that he is a very good guy, but some of his friends were questionable. One of them is an ex-convict. She was still sure that the son-in-law is a very good guy. She was pricing some bright yellow bath towels. I commented about them because they were so large and very thick. They were very nice. She asked if I was interested in them because she used to price things special if she knew I wanted them. I told her I needed to stick to my budget so I better not. She then asked Janet S if she was interested in them. When she held them up for Janet S to look at them they were draperies and not towels. She also told Janet S the size but I don't remember the number exactly. I think it was 13 inches or 18 inches. Janet S decided she wanted them. I decided I needed to leave. As I was on my way out the door. I told them I was on my way to a wedding. I came back in and said it was the wedding of my first of six Godchildren. They were amazed that I had six Godchildren. I noted also that it was the first of my parent's grandchildren to be married. Chuck C was standing at the register preparing to make a purchase. Just after I left the store, I realized that it wasn't the first Godchild but rather the second, thinking that Jody S was the first. I thought I should go back and correct my error but didn't. After leaving the store, I decided I wanted a straw hat for the wedding so I decided to go into this other store and look for one. I accidentally went back into NTNS but hurried back out hoping they didn't see me. When I went into the other store, she had a pile of three or four straw hats on her counter. The straw was beige and the ribbons were black. I decided to buy one even though the ribbon was the wrong color. I left the store. Outside the store, I pulled the black ribbon off and decided that I could buy some pink ribbon so it would coordinate more with my outfit. After leaving the store, I realized I didn't pay her. I ran back and apologized profusely for my oversight. She was very kind about it. I left the store again and headed for my car. The stores were downtown. I was parked under some steel bridges or some such. As I was trying to get to my car I realized a bunch of people, like a large family, were in the way. They were standing along the street and doing something to a baby. Perhaps they were just changing a diaper. The baby had no other clothes on and was very large; not just like a large baby but very large. I'm not sure how to describe it. The baby also looked like it had something all over it that gave its skin a glazed appearance. Just as I approached them, they finished what they were doing and left. I got into my car and left also. As I was driving, I was going very fast, because I realized I was running late. I ran over a curb on my left side. It was the kind that divides two-way traffic. I had to drive strangely to get back over the curb and onto the road properly. I worried that I would ruin a tire doing this but I didn't. Other cars were headed straight at me and had to drive to miss me. I think I was still on the right side of the road. I had the sense that it was the fact that I was in such a hurry that was causing the problem not that I was in a wrong lane. A van pulled cross ways in front of me and then drove up into a grassy hill to avoid being hit and then back onto the road behind me. I had the sense that they had been trying to merge with traffic and pulled out to far without there being adequate room for them to pull out properly so they had to make this maneuver to avoid being hit by me. It was their inappropriate driving that caused their situation not mine. As I continued to drive, I was thinking how much I hate driving downtown because I hate driving this route. I suddenly realized I had missed my exit. Shortly after that, the road became train tracks and I was the only one there. Instead of driving a car my vehicle was suddenly a semi-tractor with a chain of trailers. Instead of driving it, however, I was pushing it. It was full size and I was normal size yet I was pushing it as though I was a child playing with a toy truck. I was still hurrying because I knew I was especially late now that I had missed my turn and ran into this unexpected obstacle. As I continued to push the truck, it started to go underneath a train. I'm not sure how that would be possible. This lends itself to this on-going oddity of sizes. I pulled the truck back out from under the train and lifted it onto the next set of tracks. I eventually came to a tollbooth. There were several lanes and all were full so I got in line. Most of the other trucks had the drivers inside them but I was still outside and behind of mine. As it became my turn at the tollbooth, I pushed my truck through. It went rolling down the hill and into the highway. It was a regular highway again now. I was still waiting for the tollbooth agent so I could pay my toll. I was trying to keep an eye on my truck so I knew where it headed. I was wondering if I would be able to catch it. I saw it take an exit ramp. It was in the middle of quite a bit of traffic and seemed to be doing just fine without a driver. You would think a capable driver were at the wheel. While I was waiting to pay the toll, I saw another driver outside of his truck in the same situation. His truck had gone ahead without him. He was dancing around at the tollbooth trying to get the agent to hurry so he could catch his truck as well. I don't know why, but at this point I felt reassured that I would be able to catch my truck."

"0098"	"(2000-06-27)"	"I was looking at a picture of Matthew and myself standing in front of a tree. He was much younger than now and was standing in front of me. As I was looking at the photo another image of myself appeared in the picture, standing next to the tree, facing it, kind of hugging it. Then that image slowly faded until it was gone. Then the image of Matthew and me was replaced by an image of Jesus in long robes with his hands open/out-stretched but downward. Suddenly angels began appearing and disappearing. I was thinking how cool this was. I may have been lucid."
"0099"	"(2000-06-29)"	"I went to a party at Jane H house. I spent some time talking with her son, who is a little older than Matthew. I remember a swimming pool but I don't think I got in. I told some man about a very spiritual dream I had."
"0100"	"(2000-07-01)"	"I was at a sleep medicine conference. I saw Alan Alda there. He kissed a friend of mine. I told him he had to kiss me too. I put my hands on his cheeks and gave him a quick kiss. He didn't seem very pleased. There was some problem with taking the booth down. I was working at a boot but I don't know why. I went to the booth and it was gone, a box of my stuff was sitting on the floor. Two women that I worked for took another female coworker and me to another room to train us on closing out the paperwork and money. I did the paperwork while the other woman counted the money. I had completed some of the papers earlier but had done them partially wrong. I saw that they had used a black marker and crossed out the info that was wrong. It was personal information, like maiden name and such I think. I had to recount the money to verify from the first woman. I had trouble doing that because she had put loose change and bills in with other money so I couldn't count it, but I didn't say anything. She had rolled the other coins but put them in the wrong wrappers so I wasn't sure what I was counting there either. I still didn't say anything."
"0101"	"(2000-07-09)"	"There was something oddly familiar about this. I was at a meeting. I think at the hospital. I felt like I had been at this meeting before. There were several large round tables. Doctor Bl was sitting at one of those tables. I sat at another. Someone was sitting on both sides of him, though there was an empty chair at his table. We had been given manuals by the presenter to follow along. The pages were glossy and the colors were shades of beige/brown/gold. The man I was sitting next to had his book open to a different page than I did. Doctor Bl's was open to a still different page. I changed mine to the same page as Doctor Bl. The man next to me, whom I felt was superior in some way, told me that was wrong. That page said 1999-2000 goals and objectives. The man next to me finally convinced me it was the wrong page so I turned to the page he was on. I was walking outside, back to the meeting. Another woman walked up alongside me and took my hand. I asked her if we had met at this same meeting the last time. She said yes. She appeared older than me, with very full, shoulder length, straight, salt and pepper hair. I never did see her face. She was getting ready to take lunch to a group of people. It was part of, or an exercise of, this meeting. She stated that she had done it the last time and found it very rewarding. We had the option to take lunch to someone or to have a spiritual lunch by ourselves. She left and I prepared my car/mini-van to take lunch to some people. I had the car running and the AC running so it would cool off. It was a beautiful summer day. I remember how green the grass was. As I was doing this I felt excited like it was a very good think to do and that I would enjoy it. Then I saw other people sitting in the grass and eating lunch alone or in pairs. I thought maybe I should do the same. I remember thinking that I didn't know who I would take lunch to anyway."
"0102"	"(2000-07-09)"	"A man telling me there are clean sheets on the bed."
"0103"	"(2000-07-11)"	"Glad you're willing to try it in here. Small hand held computer and screens. I was driving over much stuff on the floor so it was very bumpy and rough. There was a man there who thought I did very well."
"0104"	"(2000-07-12)"	"Something about Barry C and my red satin nightgown but it wasn't sexual."
"0105"	"(2000-07-13)"	"Something about Raina D."
"0106"	"(2000-07-16)"	"I went to visit Chris C. He lived here in Indy. At first, it was just he and I. We didn't talk much. It was as if we didn't know what to talk about. There was food everywhere, almost as if it was on display just for people to take and eat. Lots of sweets especially. At some point Mother, Bev, and Rachel S were there too. We were mostly playing with Rachel S. Bev had a clip-on ponytail for her that Rachel S wouldn't let us put on her. However, it was very cute. She also had this little pair of eyeglasses, which she also wouldn't keep on. Chris C sold insurance. Once we got to his house, he sat in a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. Even though we didn't talk much, I suggested we get together more often. I was trying to be nice because I felt he was very lonely. He seemed to be appreciative of the offer to get together more often. I told him we had one staircase and then wondered what I was thinking and said we could get by without using it. Again, he seemed happy for the offer. I asked him what kind of insurance he sells so I could refer people to him. He said all kinds. At some point Brian F showed up. He couldn't believe all the food. He wanted some but didn't take any. I very much wanted a cream filled donut, but didn't take one. I did take a snickerdoodle. I didn't want Chris C to see that I had it even though he had told us to help ourselves. When we were getting ready to go, he loaded up this big basket/cart full of food for Bev. The items I remember were three boxes of tea, larger than VCR's. I also asked about his apartment Community to see if it was adults. I told him I was thinking about a new apartment where it would be adults only. As we were leaving in the car I realized I had looked at them once before and didn't care for them. They were brown and had brown wood front porches with railings. They were all attached to each other."
"0107"	"(2000-07-19)"	"DT online chat. I woke up to go to the bathroom thinking, I have to hurry so I don't miss much of the chat."
"0108"	"(2000-07-22)"	"Reading old email."
"0109"	"(2000-07-22)"	"I was in CHV planning a regional conference. I'm not sure who everyone was that I was working with. Barry C was there but I don't know how involved he was. I started driving home and saw the Catholic Church. It's quite possible in waking life, but I was in TH and CHV. Not sure how to explain except that I was in downtown TH and their church. I was driving through downtown CHV to go meet Barry C. When I saw the church, it had many beautiful stained glass windows. I decided that I had to stop for just a minute. I saw Reagan U and she told me where to park. I was concerned because it didn't seem like an appropriate place but she assured met hat it was and why. Something like, if anyone asks, she would make a certain gesture and they would then understand. She went into the church with me. It was as though five Masses were going on. It was not beautiful inside. I was wondering why I had gone on so to Reagan U about how beautiful it was. On the outside, I had seen these beautiful stained-glass windows. I was looking around inside trying to find them. I decided I needed to go bed because Barry C would be waiting. Reagan U left with me. We were sitting on an open-air vehicle of some kind. A man came running out shouting Good News! Good news! I was saying something like that referring to God. Several other men followed him. They were carrying Mass cups of wine. They approached our vehicle. The first man was short, blonde hair. Later, I realized that is the man Reagan U is secretly in love with. One of the men was Ernest Hartman. I drank from his cup. The next thing I knew I was back in my car trying to figure out how to get to where I was meeting Barry C. I guess I was on a cell phone because he said he was going to double back to Druiz St. to turn on the street that we both needed to be on. Right after that, I crossed over Druiz St. and realized I missed it and had to go back also. Maybe some of this was before the church. I think I got lost and this is when I saw the church. After the church, and back in my car, I saw Reagan U in her car and realized she was going to lead me to where I needed to be. I think I was driving to fast because I had to go over two lanes, into a left turn lane, to keep from rear-ending her. My first thought was how I was going to get back behind her. Then I thought I should just give her an okay sign with my fingers and find it on my own. I also realized Barry C would be wondering where I was since I was taking so long. I also realized that I didn't know where we were meeting, only the street. I wondered if I should just go home even though I couldn't let him know that I was doing that."
"0110"	"(2000-07-27)"	"I was looking at a picture of Matthew and me standing in front of a tree. He is much younger than in waking life. He is standing in front of me. As I was looking at the photo, another image of me appeared in the picture. I was standing next to the tree, facing it with my arms around it. The second image slowly faded until it was gone. The image of Matthew and me was replaced by an image of Jesus in long robes with his hands open, out-stretched but downward. Suddenly, angels began appearing and disappearing. I was thinking how cool this was."

"0112"	"(2000-08-16)"	"I was at CIIS. Michael T was looking for someone to marry. He wanted a marriage of convenience. I think he wanted an older woman that he could learn from. He asked me and I told him I would need to give it some thought. All of our classmates wanted me to say yes. Perhaps it was the next day that he and I were walking some of the trails discussing it. I had my arm linked through his. The feelings both ways were very warm. I told him that he is an amazing man, but asked him if he loved me and he said no. I told him that is why I can't marry him. Because when I do marry the next time, it will be for love."
"0113"	"(2000-08-16)"	"Someone was sprayed with pepper spray and was freaking out because they thought it was mace. Then someone sprayed three more people to show them that it was only pepper spray but they sprayed it on their shirts not on their faces."
"0114"	"(2000-08-18)"	"I think it was nighttime. I went into a hallway. The door at the end of the hall was closed. I thought I saw a shadow through the crack at the bottom of the door. I hesitated but decided to open it just a little and see if something or someone was causing the shadow. There was a man there. It was too late to get the door shut again. He pushed it the rest of the way open. He had a gun and pointed it right at my face. He was not much taller than I. Very short blonde hair, very thin, a start of a beard perhaps, maybe just had not shaved for a day or two. He grabbed me with his one free hand while keeping the gun pointed at my face with the other. I was walking backwards down the hallway. I tried to strike out but couldn't get much force behind my movements. He was going to rape me. I just kept thinking that I didn't want him to kill me. I also remember thinking that now I will know how it feels to be raped. Twice he took a deep breath and then moved as though he was going under my shirt."
"0115"	"(2000-08-18)"	"I was staying or living in a house with a large number of young people visiting. I think they may have just been visiting. The boys had made spaghetti to impress the girls. I told them I would show them how to make spaghetti that would really impress their girls, because theirs wouldn't. We started making the spaghetti. As we were breaking it up, we were putting it in sauce instead of water. Two of them were helping me break up the spaghetti. As soon as I realized we were putting it in the sauce we changed and started putting it in the water. The next thing I knew there was a man and an older Italian woman that wasn't there earlier. She was giving me a hard time, saying I don't know how to make good spaghetti either. I was trying to ignore her. I was thinking about the sauce. We needed to add garlic and (green spice?) to it. Earlier I used my arms and swept everything off the tables to start over."
"0116"	"(2000-08-18)"	"I was talking to two women and a man. One woman was Darren's new wife but it wasn't Angie Ho and I'm not even sure that Darren was my ex-husband. My ex-in-laws were there but it wasn't Ray H & Kay H [different people than in waking life] . I had begun to feel good about how I was doing on my own when the ex-wife shows up and tells me that he hasn't kept up with the car payments and now I have to catch them up. I got very upset."
"0117"	"(2000-08-18)"	"Twice I made sounds or cries aloud that woke me up. Several times, I wanted to make movements like slapping but could not do it with any force. I sensed that I was a black man."
"0118"	"(2000-08-19)"	"They were firing Jane H and I went and talked to the person who was firing her. I was very upset because I know she didn't deserve it. Somewhere along the line, someone suggested I interview to be the store manager again. I asked about the current JLI members to see if there was anyone around who would remember me. I was inside the shop but it was jut a very small room, like a small living room. There was very little merchandise. Jane H and Janet S said that's all there was. They gave the impression that there was concern that the store might have to close. There were several colors. The one that sticks in my head is red. There were two very cool pieces of furniture. I'm not sure if they were really pieces of furniture. One of them reminded me of a miniature of Grandma F's wardrobe. The other was similar, larger, and yet different. One was marked $300 and the other $130. Jane H was marking them down and making it sound as though they should already have been marked down but I wondered if she was just doing it for me, as she often does in waking life. I remember the prices $50 and $75 being mentioned or both for $125 or $150."
"0119"	"(2000-08-25)"	"I was in my home and heard much noise, as if someone was walking, stomping, or running on the roof. It was quite a commotion. I decided to go downstairs. To go downstairs I had to go through a square opening, the type you might find to enter an attic. The steps were more like a ladder. When I got down there it was almost like a cement maze. There were many people running around. There were plain-clothes police officers running frantically with guns. I crouched into a corner just as a police officer leaned against the wall over me and began shooting. A large group of men approached me, also trying to avoid being hurt, and crouched into the corner around me. We were being attacked by Russians. Some Russians found us and began shooting. It seemed that quite a few of the men around me were hit and some killed. At first, I thought they hit everyone but me and I thought about how there were enough men around me to keep me from being hit. At the same time, it almost seemed as though I had been hit also. I didn't feel any pain or anguish as I might have had I actually been hit. The next thing I know Matthew and I had been captured. We were assigned to sleeping quarters. Our sleeping quarters were oblong cement square holes in a wall. Each person had his or her own square. There was barely enough room to move. I was especially concerned about how tight it would be for me. They then gave us pajamas, or it may have been a uniform to change into. We were expected to change in our sleeping quarters. There was hardly room to move and there was no privacy. I tried putting mine on top of my other clothes and then removing my other clothes. Mine were too small so they gave me a larger set. I tried to do the same thing."
"0120"	"(2000-08-25)"	"I was at CIIS. Matthew Lauer and Ann Curry were there. There was some joke about a red bull. I was in a car with someone. They were driving. There was a life-size, cardboard, red bull in the driveway. I was telling Matthew and Ann C about it and said it sounds like something Julien would do. I went to sit down for breakfast. Julien D was there eating a bowl of cereal. They looked like colored cornball cereal. He looked at me and said, Vas is los? [German phrase I have no idea how to spell] . I said, wait a minute. Let me think. Then said, Noonagaboona. [Again, German, no idea how to spell.] I said wait a minute because I thought something else should be said first. I sat down next to Julien D and began eating cereal also."
"0121"	"(2000-08-25)"	"I was at a two-story house with many people around. There was a wood deck on the second floor with wood steps leading up to it. There was a child sitting on the edge of the deck making something creepy. Maybe something to look like mice? He was throwing them into the grass below. His mom said that what he was making and doing was very good. I had a very strange looking red tooth and there was a gap all around it. She asked me if it was real. I took it out and you could see it was plastic. It's as if I was looking at my own mouth but I didn't have a mirror. I also know the tooth wasn't real but when I pulled it out and saw it was plastic I guess it confirmed to me that it wasn't real. I put it back on. I noticed something about her dress and ran my finger along part of it. I realized that parts of her were not real either. Then there was a man sitting in a red convertible with a woman. He had apparently been practicing working on ears. He had a pair of very long surgical tweezers. He reached in her ear I think, and pulled something out. Then he said, see I can do it. They were sitting in a huge room that was very bright and sterile looking. There were other cars parked in there also. The woman was in the driver seat of this car. She was there to get her ear worked on. Someone came up, opened her car door, took her whole seat out with her still sitting in it and stuck it out the inside of her car door. The door had all kinds of wires and things showing. They put her there to work on her ear. I was in a room with wood floors and walls. The wood looked like what you see in a barn or a very rustic house. A little boy set rat free in the room. In waking life, I would have been very frightened and distraught about this. Here I stood in place and first moved slightly trying to avoid the rat. I hated it, but was trying to stay in control and not let it make me panic or scream. I thought I was doing pretty well but then it started to fly in circles around me. I started to panic a little and started swinging at it with something white. Maybe a pillow."

I told someone, more than one person, what we were doing though I didn't actually see other people. I started moving everything out of the garage into the driveway. There were many bikes, boxes, linens not in boxes or anything, gift tins and baskets with things in them. I don't remember throwing anything away or giving anything away. I was just organizing to make things fit better. One of the baskets had many little, jewelry-sized gift-wrapped boxes in it. I realized that I had saved those to use for future gifts."

I moved closer to him and put my hand on his thigh. We kissed again."
"0128"	"(2000-09-21)"	"I think I was at CIIS. I said something to a group about my trying to live by the Golden Rule. They just smiled and snickered. I went into another room to change to take a walk with two other women. I put on black socks and black tennis shoes. I had a dress on. I said, This looks goofy doesn't it? They agreed with me. I pulled the skirt off and was going to change into pants or shorts. I was trying to zip my suitcase closed, but it was full of potato chips or Tostitos, and they kept falling out. Someone told me a call had been made to let someone know that the group had voted me best because of my comment about the Golden Rule."
"0129"	"(2000-10-21)"	"I was going to Minnesota to give a dream lecture. The company I was working for was sending four other people with me. Two men and two women. They were going along to share driving duties. There was some discussion about how long the drive was and if it was worth it to make the drive to do the dream lecture. It was decided, though I don't think everyone agreed, that it was a 24-hour drive and so we would go. I don't remember actually giving the lecture. At the end of the lecture, all five of us sat around a table, yet all facing the audience, to answer audience questions. I ended up behind some of the others. One of the men in our group, Terry [unknown in waking life] , I had a real problem with his behavior, his dress and the way he talks. He ended up in front. My dreamwork manager rushed out to the stage and had Terry and I trade places. My dreamwork manager was Tom Selleck. At one point during the Q & A session, Terry was standing behind the rest of us rather than sitting at the table. I turned around to look at him and realized his pants were unzipped and his penis was half sticking out. One of the girls in the group saw it at the same time, jumped up, went over to him, and zipped his pants up. We needed to call someone, a woman. I said I didn't know her phone number. One of the girls in the group got smart with me and said, What? Are you incapable of remembering a phone number? I was hurt and mad. I said I have too many things to remember. That is why I didn't know her phone number. Tom came out and took care of things."

He is tall, thin, with blondish-brown hair. He is very kind and yet very strong personally. We have a bunch of children with us. I think we are just sightseeing and such. We see this man sitting in a chair. I think he was playing music. His pants are unzipped and his penis is showing. As I notice it, his erect penis comes completely out of his pants and is laying flat against the chair. Right after this happens something black, reminds me of a worm but it wasn't that, slides down the length of his penis and disappears. I thought it was nasty and wondered what it was. As Daniel, I, and the children are sightseeing, we are participating in lots of local activities. It is a very small town, smaller than St. Joe, where everyone knows each other, gets along well together, and does many fun things together. We join them in some kind of choral concert. We, or the children, are singing with them. I feel more as if I am observing than participating but I'm fairly sure the children were participating. It feels as though Daniel and I are taking an open carriage ride in the early evening, though it is dark. We are talking about how wonderful and beautiful it is there and how great it would be to live there. We talk especially about what it would be like in the winter, with the snow, and at Christmas. It wasn't snowing, the leaves had all turned colors, it was beautiful, and the air was crisp and cool. Yet, I had a very clear picture of the area after a large snow. I could literally see it. I saw a couple of men clearing snow from their cars. One has a shovel and seems to be trying to get snow out from under the front driver's side wheel well. Then I'm back to reality and noticing the beautiful fall colors again. I notice two little tiny people in a tree. One male and one female. They are maybe only two inches tall. I have a sense that I see them and yet at this time I also feel like I might be the female. It may be that the male lives in that tree but the female is just there, visiting. They are somewhat concerned, but not terribly, but something that is happening. The tree begins to shake. A little bit later, Daniel and I are back with the children doing something else. One of the children finds two little flat things lying on the ground. They appear to be the kind of plastic clear and color decals that I put on my windows at Christmas time. These look like the two tiny people. We realize that whatever happened to the tree did this to them, that the two little things, were actually these people and they were now gone for good. It was sad and yet okay both. There is another adult. We called him Cooter. He is in the car with Daniel and a little girl. He said something to the little girl about Uncle Cooter always being there for her. The next thing I know Daniel and I are back home, to my home, with the children. It is a very lovely middle-class home. We try to get all the children into bed. I don't know where Cooter is at this time. I am observing this and yet at the same time feel as though I am the woman. I go to the other end of the house. It seems to be a long house because there seems to be quite a distance between the children's room and my room. Daniel came into my room. I am already dressed for bed in a spaghetti strap satin full-length nightgown. I lay down on top of the blankets. Daniel lies down with me and is holding me. We are discussing him staying there with me. possibly marriage. living with us. I get the sense that the children are foster children. There are a number of boys and I think just one girl. This next part is weird but I will explain as best I can. I suddenly feel as though I am Daniel and that I am holding the woman. I am holding her in a way that my right arm is running parallel to and cupping her legs, buttocks, and back. It's kind of like I am a huge person and at the same time this entire part of her body is the same size as the length of my arm. There is also the sense that I am holding both the woman and Daniel. I think we finally decide that we will give it a go. sharing the home and love of and care for the children. I don't know if that means marriage or simply living together though. It almost seems this is another scene but there is discussion about Cooter and what will happen to him. He doesn't have a place to live. My first thought is to turn a shed in the back yard into a bedroom. I realize then that he would be coming in and out of the house using our kitchen, bathrooms, etc, and we Daniel and I wouldn't have any privacy that way. I suggest that we build him an apartment over the garage."
"0131"	"(2000-10-22)"	"It was the morning of October 21, 2000. I was at this large, old house. 2-3 people showed up for the first regional conference. They had not pre-registered but rather just showed up hoping to get in. I explained to them that the event had been cancelled and I think they left but I'm not sure. The next thing I know there are 50 or more people there for the same reason. Wanting to attend but not having pre-registered. I had them all take a seat at tables. The tables were all like dining tables and set up with dinnerware for a meal. I climbed halfway up this very wide staircase to speak to the people. I said, I am vertically challenged so I'm going to stand up here to help you hear me. They all chuckled. I announced that there had been a problem with the mailing and so we had cancelled the event. Since there were so many of them there, we were going to see what we could do to accommodate them. I explained that there was no way we could get Bart H there at this late notice, but I would see if we could get Barry C on an immediate flight. I also stated that my presentation would be different since I did not have the proper AV equipment. I was thinking that I would only tell them that much although I was worrying about it because I had not finished preparing that talk. I was also trying to figure out what we were going to do about food, etc. I didn't mention anything about vendors because I knew there was nothing that could be done about that. I noted that two of the people who had signed in were people who had worked with dreams and I think I knew them. I had asked one of them if he could make a presentation to fill in the space allotted for Bart H. Somehow the other one got the message that I had asked for him. I decided that was fine. Regarding the food, at first I thought I would have to just tell them they would be on their own for lunch. A little later, I thought I about doing something simple that could be done last minute like calling Subway to deliver. That way we could still do the lunchtime dream discussion groups. I told the people who were there that I would figure out an adjusted price due to the circumstances. I thought a little more about what would be involved to get Barry C here. I thought he would surely have some money in a savings account that he could pay his expenses just until he got there and then I could reimburse him. I would have to tell him not to call Continental just to use his $100 voucher but try to find the best airfare for the time he needed. I would also tell him to just take a cab when he gets here and I would reimburse him for that as well. He might have to take a cab from his home to the CHV airport as well. I think I woke up more than once in the middle of this dream [unless I was simply lucid] thinking I can't believe that this is a dream and the event was supposed to be yesterday. But I am working through this in such detail in a dream, knowing that it didn't or wouldn't happen."

"0136"	"(2000-10-28)"	"I went to a hotel somewhere to be with Daniel R. While I was there, I realized Aimee F was also there to be with Daniel R. Of course, I was upset. I was in a huge hotel room suite that had two bathrooms. I went into one bathroom and Daniel R was in there taking a bath. I went into the other bathroom and there was someone who looked exactly like him also taking a bath. I realized at that point that he had a twin. While they were in the bathtubs, they were both drinking and smoking cigars. Later I realized he was one of triplets, not twins. I knew now that Aimee F was there for Daniel R's twin. I think we were in Las Vegas. I believe we went to dinner with a group of people. Daniel R sat next to me though he hardly said anything to me the entire time. Even when he did, it was things that sounded like he was making fun of me, as he used to do in waking life. Something happened, maybe Daniel R's comment, that made me realize I did not want to be with him any more. I realized that I deserved better than this. However, I was afraid of what he might do if I tried to leave. So I was trying to figure out a way to sneak out. Aimee F had decided to stay. She thought she could get what she wanted out of the relationship with the twin without doing anything she didn't want to do. There were two other men who worked for Daniel R who were going to help me sneak out. I packed my suitcases. I went into this elevator. I don't remember exactly how this happened but the elevator turned sideways and I slid out rather than stepping out like you normally would. It wasn't dangerous or scary. I just remember thinking how odd it was. As I was leaving, there was a large crowd of people gathered for some event. I saw the top of Daniel R's head but was sure he didn't see me. I went to a car with the one man who was helping me to leave. We put all of my suitcases and things in the back seat. I remember throwing a coat back there too. That man walked away then to find the other man, who was going to drive me to the airport. When that man got there I remember checking the backseat to make sure all of my things were still back there. As we drove away, I felt confident that Daniel R would not know I was leaving and that I would get away without any problems."
"0137"	"(2000-11-09)"	"I was in a very large dining facility to give a dream lecture. I was trying to figure out the best place for me to stand to speak so that everyone in the facility would be able to hear me. I saw no place for me to stand so that everyone could see me. This was the shape of the room. I stood on a chair thinking that would help. It was a metal folding chair. I told the crowd that I was trying to find a way that they would all hear me. Everyone was sitting at dining tables eating. Right after I got up on the chair, people started moving around finding different places to sit. All of the people from one of the ells came and sat on the floor in the main area. I said, Good, I didn't feel very safe on this chair in these heels. I looked down, thinking I had on high heels. I had on red shoes with a little heel, but they were not high heels. I mumble something like well they wouldn't have been so bad. There was a fourth part of the room, where the double arrows are, that seemed like it might have been a bar. There were employees of the facility in that area but I don't recall seeing anyone else. Before I started giving my talk, I asked one of the men in the room to take some occasional pictures for me, as I needed them for PR purposes. I showed him how to work my camera. He seemed perfectly okay with doing that. not put out or hassled or anything. I didn't notice him taking any pictures after that. I asked the crowd, What are dreams? A man walked by me and gave me a scientific answer. I laughed and said, You're absolutely right! Still chuckling, I said I've never gotten that answer before, but you are absolutely right! The crowd laughed too. A few other people gave me answers. I was going through explanations of why I was not addressing the scientific explanation of dreams. My explanation included the fact that I am right-brained. though I went through a little mental conversation to get to this phrase. The explanation also included the fact that when I go into scientific explanations I prefer to have my notes in front of me. This likely relates to the scientific aspects of my work and how I feel about talking about scientific and physiological explanations of things there. I then asked, What is the purpose of dreams? I got several answers but none that I was looking for. Therefore, I gave them five purposes of dreams. They included wish fulfillment and playtime. I don't remember now what the other three reasons were that I gave them. I had a heavy stack of 8 x 14 paper in my arms that had things printed on them. notes and pictures for my talk. I was trying to use them as notes but they were too heavy and awkward to hold as I was walking around the room talking so I put them down. I kept the top sheet that I was talking about at that time. It had several pictures on it. Each picture had words on it. The one picture I was currently talking about had something to do with Freud and some of the words were in Spanish and/or French. I read the words, stumbling over them a bit. The man taking pictures for me also read it aloud, much more clearly than I did. I think he said it would be much easier if you knew a foreign language. [Somehow I got this message but I'm not sure how.] I have a sense that the talk went very well. I felt on. I felt the high that I do when I have given a talk that has gone very well and been received very well. The audience seemed to be enjoying themselves. I think this area might be part of a hotel but I'm not sure. Either earlier or in a prior dream last night I was at the hotel. I only remember that I had been at that place or hotel earlier. I don't even know if I left and came back or if I was staying at the hotel for the purpose of giving this talk. I have a sense that it was two separate events and/or times."
"0138"	"(2000-11-09)"	"I was five people at once, moving in a clockwise circle on top of the head of a pin. The direction changed to clockwise because someone said it needed to for safety reasons. I'm not sure why."
"0139"	"(2000-11-11)"	"I was in this very large house. It belonged to very wealthy people. Some young people were having a party here. I don't think their parents knew about it. Perhaps it was an after-prom party, but I'm not sure. Many of the kids were making-out in several of the rooms. Particularly, I found a couple in one of the bedrooms. I was wondering through the house, simply because it was such a large, expensive home and I was interested in seeing all the rooms. I would go up a flight of stairs and the only room would be another bedroom. Another flight of stairs, one bedroom. Etc. I did this several times. On one floor of the building, the bedroom was all white, the furnishings, and everything. It was more like a suite. The front room, I think, was the bathroom and then led into the area where the bed was. In the bed area, the walls seemed to be covered with white billowy curtains. For some reason, I think there were two beds, side by side, instead of one. This doesn't make sense to me because this is the room where the owners of the house would go to make love. Maybe I'm not remembering it right but it just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it was one large bed or two twin beds. Anyway, the bed(s) face an extremely large Jacuzzi. It is the walls around the Jacuzzi that have the white billowy curtains. I thought what a beautiful room this was. But there were no other furnishings or decorations in this room. Just the beds, the Jacuzzi, and the curtains. I think I may have been with someone as I was later checking all the rooms. I don't know if I was checking to make sure everyone was gone or if I was looking for someone. Actually, I think I was looking for someone, but found individual people in more than one bedroom."

"0143"	"(2000-11-26)"	"I was driving in a seemingly unfamiliar town. I decided to drive down C Street as I thought I would find something at the end of that street that I might be interested in. As I neared the end of C Street, I decided that I should probably cross over to D Street. As I was preparing to do that, I passed Cox's. I'm not sure what it was. maybe a factory. I said to myself, Oh yes! I remember them. I think that maybe I worked in the office there for a short time. As I was driving by, I saw a man come out the door with his adult son. The son was mentally handicapped. I said to myself, I remember them, too. He always used to take his son to work and pick him up again. The only difference is that people knew about his disability and they didn't know about mine. I kept driving. As I was driving through the city streets, I realized that I had to merge into the left lane because there was a police car up ahead of me and there was a man dressed in brown lying on the street behind the police car. I was watching the traffic trying to get over and I got very, very close to the police car. I was able to stop before hitting it. The police officer looked up and gave me a dirty look. I backed up and went around. As I went around, however, I noticed that the man was no longer there. I was now walking on the sidewalk instead of driving. I noticed that this town had a section of stores that was more or less New Age. I decided to go into one of them. It was a clothing store. The name was Wicca Fashions or something with the name Wicca in it. As I was in there browsing, I came across some exercise clothing. One of the sales clerks approached me and encouraged me to try it on. From looking at it, I couldn't believe that I would like the way it looked on me. It was two piece, knit, tight fitting, and grey. I went ahead and took one off the rack and started to the dressing room. As I did so, Ruth M came in to see me or to wait for me. To go into the dressing room was a very narrow hallway and one with several twists and turns. I had to back against the wall and squeeze through around each wall. As I got in, I realized that it was also a bathroom and the stalls were very small as well. The sales clerk had come in with me. As I was putting the outfit on she was using the bathroom, she called, by phone, to the front of the store, and told someone we needed more toilet paper. I was totally shocked when I put the outfit on. It was totally sheer, like stockings. I was surprised that as far as my figure was concerned it didn't look bad but I didn't like the sheer aspect at all. I pointed out to the sales clerk how clearly my varicose veins, which I don't have, could be seen. They were quite significant and primarily on one buttock and on an outer thigh. The sales clerk, of course, thought it looked great and tried to say that the sheerness didn't matter. I told her I needed to get back out to my friend that was waiting on me."
"0144"	"(2000-11-27)"	"I married Chip P in a very casual ceremony. We were dressed in black and white casual clothes. He sang to me during the ceremony. I stood with my hand in the crook of his arm. I was thinking about whether or not I was sexually attracted to him."
"0145"	"(2000-11-27)"	"I was somehow involved in the care of children. We all lived in this mansion. My bedroom had no window. Niles from the TV show The Nanny was there.

I let one of the little children have all of my turns."
"0146"	"(2000-11-28)"	"I had called Kate D because I thought she should have a list of the phone numbers. I worked with her. Her son answered the phone and said she had them. I asked him to read them to me. There were quite a few. When he read them, there were two digits, the seven-digit phone number, and then two more digits. The first two and last two were always the same and the sequence was in the tens and twenties. When Kate D found out Jonathan D had given me this information she became very upset with him because he gave this information out and he didn't know who he gave it to. She said he should never have done that. Later when I was with Kate D, we were sitting on the floor talking, with our backs leaned up against the wall. I said that it is very hard for me to remember that I am no longer in control there. My eyes started to tear a bit and I wiped them dry. I realized that I needed to tell her it was me that called Jonathan. I didn't want her to think less of me or be mad at me, so I was trying to figure out what to tell her about why I had called and why I had asked for that information. I decided to tell her that truth. that I called because I thought she should have the information and when Jonathan said she did I asked him to read it to me to verify it."

I specifically remember peeling off the stick-on's, but they were even on the refrigerator door. I kept finding more. When we started painting, we did just a little bit under the windowsill to see how it would look after it dried. The next morning we looked at it and it was a yellowish-beige instead of teal. I took a razor blade and started scraping off the top layer, which exposed the teal. But the teal part was somewhat wet and left it looking rough or textured rather than smooth. I said, well, we could make it work this way. Then Matthew, or perhaps someone else, found the problem and pointed it out. It says to use egg noodles and the ones we used weren't egg. I ate some of the non-egg noodles and then rinsed my mouth as though I had just brushed my teeth. I brushed them over and over again. My teeth and mouth seemed to be coated with teal paint and the water kept rinsing it out. Matthew came up and said, the water is clear now mom! I rinsed a couple more times anyway."
"0149"	"(2000-12-03)"	"I was walking around this one section of town. The town reminded me of my mother's hometown. I was trying to get some Avon orders to supplement my income since I don't have a regular job right now. I thought that perhaps I should get some books and start working the area for a while until I get another job. As I was walking, I was trying to identify the houses that I know had bought from me before. I walked across these two piles of firewood, stacked side-by-side, belonging to two different families. While I was doing that, some of the wood from a third pile rolled own a small embankment. I didn't go pick it up, convincing myself that it wasn't my fault. I walked by one house and there were many people inside. They might be having a party, so I started to walk on by. They had long rows of small cages with rabbits in them. I saw an opening where I thought I could walk between them but realized there was something overhead and I would have to get on my hands and knees to get through. About that time, the woman that lived there came out and wanted to know why I was there. I told her. She said the only Avon she buys is reorder stuff. I said, Okay. Thanks. Then I left. At this point, there are two other Avon reps walking with me. The woman who owns the woodpile walks up and talks about having to pick it all up. I didn't realize who she was or what she was talking about until she left and the other three of us walked past there again and I saw the little plastic fence messed up. I fixed the fence, put it back in place, but still didn't say it was my fault. On the other side of the fence was a long row of flowers. They looked like they were something special. They were tied up with string that was held up by poles to keep the string 8-12 inches above the ground. I was glad the wood hadn't hurt any of the flowers, but still didn't say anything. We continued walking. We came to a large rack with rows of pullout shelves. It had a few very small potted plants on them. The two women I was with turned some of them on their side so the Avon person responsible for them would know to throw them away. I realized that one of the two people with me was Laura Bl."
"0150"	"(2000-12-06)"	"There were mice in the apartment. They were mostly visible running between the wall and the layer of paint. I watched one run across the ceiling just under the paint, another down the wall, the same way. However when that one came to the floor it ran out and across the floor. Matthew sat something on it and smashed it. I was upset that it was there but also that Matthew had killed it. When he looked, though, it wasn't dead. He went ahead and killed it because it was so injured. I called the apartment office and told them about the problem. I asked if they would call an exterminator. I told them that I had already paid for an exterminator once. I also told them I went through two cans of bug spray trying to get rid of all the ants here. I don't remember if they answered me. I also called someone to get a quote on replacing my carpet and linoleum. I had gotten a quote from this man before, but I didn't tell him that until he got here. Then I tried to make some excuse for not telling him before. We talked about the kitchen first. The floor was divided into three sections. Each section was a different kind of flooring. He brought a woman with him. He said they couldn't do anything to the wood. I said that was fine. I wanted to keep it anyway. They asked about the parquet and I said I wanted it changed. They tore up one corner of the linoleum. They finished the quote. It was about $2300. I knew I couldn't afford that so I was wondering if I could afford part of it and if so which parts to do. I noticed the floor they had torn up in the kitchen. The gold sculpture carpet in the living room and the green carpet in the hallway. I then remembered that the apartment manager would be replacing it in less than a year. I wondered if I should just wait. But I wanted it to look good for the dream groups I will be starting in January. There was also something about me being at the office talking to Laura Bu. There was row/wall of windows that were different shapes and sizes. When I looked a second time, some of the windows were screens. I was talking to Laura Bu through one of the screens. I also remember that going into the house with the man for a carpet quote, we had to go up a set of steps. There were two separate sets. Both were very high and I directed him to enter through the ones that were less high. I couldn't just step into them. I had to climb onto them."

"0152"	"(2000-12-26)"	"I was preparing to get married. I don't think I was marrying him for love as part of an undercover plan. He was an extremely wealthy man with a very large estate. He seemed apprehensive about whether the plan would work or not. His estate consisted of a number of buildings. There were quite a number of people who were unhappy about the marriage, including all of my bridesmaids. All of the bridesmaids were not even my friends but acquaintances of his or of the people planning the wedding. The bridesmaids seemed to dislike me/or at least be very upset with me that I was marrying this man. I had gotten dressed for the wedding, traditional wedding gown, and stuck my make-up bag in a pocket of my gown and went to the building where the wedding was to be held. It was not a church. I saw several of the bridesmaids standing around. There were quite a few of them. Maybe even twelve. Their dresses were very simple and elegant, satin and a kind of purple/blue color. They were all very rude to me because they did not like it that I was marrying this man. I rushed into a small room to put my make-up on. Just as I was finishing someone came in to tell me it was time and ask if I was ready. I said I was ready when they were. I left that room and found that several of my bridesmaids were out of place. One was lying down on a bed complaining of cramps another was out of place but I don't remember what her problem was. I told them we would go on without them. As I got to the room where the wedding was being held the bridesmaids had all gone down the aisle already and it was my turn. As I entered the room, I nodded to someone and an usher seated one last couple. I am assuming now that it was the groom's parents. As I was walking down the aisle, I noticed that the room was full of celebrity's. I noticed Michael Jackson wearing a black jacket with circles on it made of gold threads and Elvis Presley. As I got to the end of the aisle there was another couple standing there, waiting to be married. I didn't know before then that it was going to be a double ceremony but I just stepped to the side to stand next to them. As I did someone told me I had to move all the way down to make room for the other couples. A rock band got up right in front of me and started playing. I started to get upset because I didn't like all of these surprises, especially things that I would not have at my wedding, like bridesmaids that were not my friends, other people marrying at the same time, the rock band. My fiance and I left the room without being married. We were standing out side talking. We suddenly kissed very long and hard and realized at that time that we truly did love each other. I felt that I was the male and had initiated the kiss and was a bit taller than the woman was. We are lying under this giant hamburger. It almost seems as though we were lying in a grill but it wasn't hot or anything. We were eating the hamburger, laughing and having a good time. The hamburger had cole slaw covering the top of it. There were a couple of bites out of it. Someone came along and my fiance stood up. When he did, all I could see where his head should have been was the hamburger. I realized that the hamburger was hiding his head and that this was probably a good thing. I realized that the hamburger was hiding his head from the person he was talking to as well."
"0153"	"(2000-12-27)"	"I was in a department store with Margie D. We were in the linen section. She was looking at slipcovers and commented to me that she was thinking of getting one. I told her that I had recently purchased them for both my sofa and my oversized chair. I also said that while they didn't fit exactly right because of the low arms on my sofa, I am pretty happy with them. I don't remember if I mentioned the color or not. I recall seeing the linens. They were all solid colors, deep colors like navy, forest green, burgundy, etc. While we were looking, I noticed two small girls came up to a screen door and said something to someone in the store. I noticed the man they were speaking with. After they left, I asked him if they were his daughters and he said yes. I commented that they were very cute. As he walked away, I thought he was an attractive man. Then I reminded myself that this was Ernie C I was talking about, and I did not want to get involved with him. The man didn't look like Ernie C until he began to walk away and it wasn't until then that I noted that it was he. Prior to that, I was not familiar with the man. Since Margie D was still looking, I told her I was going to another part of the store and would be back. I put a question mark after store because the environment seems to be confused between being a store and being an office. I'm not sure if it changes or if I just don't know for sure which it is. As I was walking around, I saw Tonya H but didn't get a chance to speak to her. I kept walking and saw my old office at the sleep center. I took a few steps back to look in because I noticed that they had taken a wall out and made one much larger office. When I looked into the office I noticed that they had made this space the office space and had five chairs lined up in a row along a table. This was their workspace. It was very close. They barely had room to move without touching each other. There were three of six people sitting there working. Two of them I did not know. One of them was Lilly H. I asked her how she liked her new space. I said it somewhat sarcastically because I guessed she probably didn't. I tried not to be too sarcastic though because I didn't know the other two people sitting there. She gave me a guarded answer for the same reason but I realized that my suspicion was right. she didn't like the new arrangements. I noticed a baby lying on a blanket on the floor on its back playing. Even though the baby was Caucasian I asked Lilly H if it was Tonya H's new baby. In waking life, Tonya H has only one child and he is perhaps 10-12 years old. I don't remember what Lilly H told me about the baby. I asked if Tonya H was around. She was but not somewhere that I could catch her or speak to her. As I turned around to leave I noticed Steve J. I hurried a bit to make sure I caught him. I said Hi, Steve J! With much enthusiasm. As I did this and got closer, I realized that it was not Steve J. The man asked me if he knew me. I said something trying to make it sound like he did but that I wasn't exactly sure how. I didn't want to admit that I had made a mistake. As I was talking, I leaned and looked at his nametag. It said Steve Galaad [unknown in waking life] . He was a construction worker or something because he had a hammer in his hand that he had raised in the air as we talked. I finally admitted that perhaps we didn't know each other and I must have mistaken him for someone else. I went back to find Margie D to see if she was ready to go. I found her and her two daughters sitting at a large round table eating. I asked what time I had left and they said 7:45 p.m. It was now 8:56 p.m. I said I've been gone an hour? I was surprised and very apologetic. As Margie D would have done in waking life she said it was no big deal and that, fortunately, she had remembered where to get food nearby. at a Chinese restaurant. They were all eating Chinese food. They offered me some but I declined. I apologized again. The table seemed to be in the linen department where the dream began."
"0154"	"(2001-01-06)"	"I was a student at a school and I had done something I shouldn't have. or was at least involved in it with someone else. At least part of it was graffiti. I don't remember what the graffiti was. We ran away but were caught. After being caught, someone else and I had the opportunity to run again. The person who did the graffiti told us to run without him. One part of this that is confusing is that the people I was running with changed several times. I don't know who it was initially. At one point, it was The Golden Girls and later it was girls I went to high school with, and another time it was only Brenda E. At the end, it was my family, Mother, Daddy, Brian F, Bev, and Bill F F. When I was running with Brenda E, I was getting very frustrated with her because she wasn't hiding or keeping up very well. There was a third person running with us. I don't know who. They were way behind. I thought they would catch up with us. We snuck around a red brick school. I was afraid someone would see as through the windows. I told Brenda E to keep down and come around the walls. There were several red brick walls. They were a wavy shape lengthwise. Then we snuck around another red brick building. We finally dodged inside a little dry cleaner/seamstress shop. There were three huge basket-like things hanging from the ceiling and moving back and forth on purpose and rhythmically. We each jumped up and clung to the end of one to keep from being seen by the employees. When we had a chance, we ducked into the next room. We were crouched on the floor behind a circular rack of clothes and fabric. Brenda E wasn't hiding well and I feared we would be seen. One thing in the rack was sheer brown piece of fabric. I could see the old woman through the fabric. I was afraid she would see us. I moved the rod in a circular motion very slightly trying to keep us hidden but she spotted us anyway. I lied and told her that we just needed to duck in from the cold. They took pity on us. Now I'm with my family but still in the same place. The young woman was doing makeovers on us to help keep us from being found. She made Kim H look like a movie star, as she requested. She asked me how I would like my hair done. I told her I like my style so she started spraying it seriously with hair spray. I felt like I was choking on the spray and told her to quit. I was thinking about what movie start I wanted to be made up as but didn't think of anyone so she didn't do anything else to me except to give me a bag of ice and told me to hold it on my face to reduce the puffiness. I held it on my eyes. My family and I are walking downtown Indy. I am watching the people very carefully to make sure none of them are the people who are after us. All I remember seeing is people in business suits carrying briefcases. It is now becoming nighttime and the streets are deserted. We see the horse-drawn carriage nearby sitting by Steak-N-Shake. It is empty but I tell the others that we must stay away from there or we are more likely to get caught. We are in a building looking at displays. They are Christmas displays mostly. One had many stuffed animals. I also saw a bed and pushed on the mattress and said how nice it would be to be in my own bed. Mari Kate S was with us now. We were purchasing things. I remember sweatshirts specifically. We were being careful to use cash so we wouldn't be leaving a trail. Brian F handed me some receipts and told me to make sure I used them. I started filling one out and realized I had written SVSDC, disclosing information on it. I tore it up, showed it to Brian F, threw it away and then paid cash for the sweatshirts. There were people there who were looking for us but they didn't give us away for some reason. The last room we went into had a lot of computers and electronics. I sat down at a desk to check my email. BJ said something about the amount of email. I then saw a Karaoke machine and asked Daddy to come record a song with me. He was a short, dark-haired, Italian man. Brian F joined us. I didn't want him there, but let him stay. We were going to sing We Wish You A Merry Christmas but we didn't know the version that was playing. Then a familiar version began playing so we started to sing. I was thinking that this was good, as I would be able to listen to and better decide if I am a good singer. The guy running the electronic place said he needed to close up. We said we would help because we are very familiar with the things there. We said Mother is very familiar with the type of typewriter so she could take care of it. I saw her sitting on the floor with the case, cleaning it, as part of closing up. I was looking under all the desks for money. Whenever I found change, I put it in my pocket. I found four quarters in a pile and under one desk."
"0155"	"(2001-01-06)"	"My husband is trying to find our kids and me after an accident. Maybe a car accident, maybe a fire, maybe both. Someone tells him that it is too late, that we have died. I'm saying, no, it isn't. You just have to look here. I think we are in a car but I think there are flames also."
"0156"	"(2001-01-06)"	"FD was short-handed. They called and asked me to come in and help for just one night. I agreed. I was surprised at what I found. The place was a mess. I went back to the grill. There was as bun and a hamburger on the grill. not cooking but maybe being kept warm. There were also a bunch of candy wrappers in a section attached to the grill. like the drip pan. The one I remember was an M&M wrapper. I told someone working there that you should always but two meat patties on a sandwich because it will taste much better and people will pay extra for it. I was making someone a fish sandwich so I put two pieces of fish on it. I went to look at the work schedule to see who was coming in that night. It said, Cutler. It was typed in bold black letters. He had been scheduled the previous night also. I thought it was good that he was scheduled because he's a good kid and good worker. For some reason I realized I would have to clean up the kitchen at close. That's a hard and messy job. When it was close to closing time, I took a metal piece off the ice cream syrup to wash it. I got extra syrup on it taking it out. It strung out like melted cheese. The syrup was chocolate and butterscotch. It was good."
"0157"	"(2001-01-17)"	"Matthew left for school in the morning and I began working on Christmas presents. I think I was going to wrap some. I had told him to separate the ones for us from the ones for others. The ones for us were to be around the base and front of the tree. I found some for BJ's family, I think, around the front. They had been wrapped by the store in solid color shiny paper. They had little stickers on them that said what is inside. At first, I didn't like the stickers then I decided they were okay. There was a little more room under the tree than in waking life. Several of the packages were very tall and I thought I would lay them on their sides and slide them under the tree. Matthew cam back home. He had car trouble. I went with him in my car to do something about it. While driving/riding I realized we were sitting still in the road. I brought it to Matthew's attention. He looked and realized the car was not in gear. He put it in drive and started going again. He was very distraught about having car problems again. He was thinking about that instead of his driving. We started discussing his finances to see if he had the money to pay for more repairs. I asked him if he had anything in the bank and he said no. Then I asked how much he had in the bank and he said only about $3500. I was very surprised and said, really? He said yes, shaking his head yes at the same time. I suggested that it would be okay for him to buy another used car. We went to look for one. We went to a dealership. The owner walked by us and I told him I was referred to him. I said Matthew's paternal grandmother and his mother were good friends. He looked at us as if he didn't want to be bothered because he didn't know us but I guess he decided to he should because of his mother. Don H was there also. I said, Don H, I was going to call you because I need your help. I wanted him to help Matthew find and purchase a car. We were sitting at a table with the owner and he was hassling us as if he couldn't help. Finally, Darren handed him a check for $35 and said to put him in a car. I told him to make it $75 because I don't want him paying on this forever. He said he didn't think he could do anything because he doesn't sell blue cars, meaning inexpensive or lower end. I said that I was guessing his mother is a friend of Matthew's grandmother they must be somewhat alike. She would probably expect him to help us. He was visibly upset but obviously agreed with me. He told an employee to get the cash box. I could tell he wasn't getting ready to go show us some cars. After he walked away, I realized there were two rows of tables where employees were sitting, maybe having lunch. A black man sitting at one end was sitting there laughing about our conversation. He said the owner couldn't find anything for $75 a month, but knew he would sell us something for that amount because of his mother. I gave the man a playful slap on the arm and said, don't mess with my game here. He laughed harder and nodded his head yes."
"0158"	"(2001-01-19)"	"I was in my bedroom and heard someone come in the front door. The alarm sounded but they silenced it. I knew it wasn't Matthew. I closed and locked my bedroom door. The burglar came to my bedroom door and was quietly trying to get in. He was trying to remove the hinge pins that were on my side of the door. I was pressing my body against the door and holding the lower hinge pin in with my fingers. The pin was missing from the top. He finally gave up and left. I went downstairs, locked the front door, and reset the alarm. The burglar tried to get back in through a dog door at the bottom of the front door. I held the point of iron in the hole to press against/into his head as he tried to enter. I told someone to call 911. The police arrived and arrested him. Two black women, my roommates, showed up. They didn't want him arrested. They had given him the alarm passcode so he could get in. So I told them they should not have done that and they needed to move out that day."
"0159"	"(2001-01-20)"	"I was at a department store with Theresa Ah. They had candy on sale so I bought several bags- each a different kind. I also bought two desserts. One was a cream pie."
"0160"	"(2001-01-21)"	"There were puppy dogs that looked like Goonies."
"0161"	"(2001-02-03)"	"Rick A and Bill Cra were there. I was working at an ice cream shop or a fair, not sure which. A child came up and asked for an adult sundae. It was supposed to have vanilla and chocolate ice cream. I put the vanilla in and then started to put strawberry in it. I realized my mistake and scraped the strawberry out. I was being interviewed I was at a ball game or racetrack. Ruth M was there. It was a bright, sunny day. I was sitting in the grass, wearing a dark-colored short skirt. I pulled the skirt down as far as I could while sitting. It came just above my knees."
"0162"	"(2001-02-04)"	"Myself, Dorothy S, and two of her girls were there. Ray K and Kay H were in it. I was in their car. When we arrived at our destination they opened the trunk and insisted on giving me cans of various kinds of fish. Some were salmon in sardine cans."
"0163"	"(2001-02-06)"	"I was riding this thing I called a bike but it was actually shaped more like a go-cart. It was a metal frame like a bike with just a seat and an awning over head. I was headed to this restaurant, maybe Denny's. As I neared the restaurant, it started to rain slightly. I thought how fortunate I was that I was almost there. When I got to the restaurant, I couldn't find a place to park. I thought it was just as well because I was afraid the bike might be stolen. I folded it up, much as you would fold a luggage carrier and took it inside. When I got inside, I was looking for a place to stand it and a place for me to sit. I struggled a bit, moving it around because it was so big. I finally leaned it against the wall near the coat rack. There were two overcoats hung on peg hooks on the wall so the bike was on top of them. Until this point, I was not thinking about why I was going there or that I was meeting someone else. I entered the restaurant looking for a place to sit alone. After I got in there I saw the women that I was meeting there and went to sit with them. While we were eating, several men came up to us. The other women knew them because they work with them. After a brief conversation, one of the men showed us a video. The video was of a large room with probably hundreds of men in it. I recall one young man in particular. It was his first time in that place and he seemed unsure about himself. The man who took him there was showing him around as if training him for a new job. I have some sense that the men in the video were mobsters. Suddenly, a group of men with machine guns came in and started killing everyone. I watched the video as it scanned the room. Men were falling everywhere as they were gunned down. I kept wondering why no one told this one young man to fall to the ground to try to protect himself. The video had a strong impact on me. I still have a very vivid image of one of the men. He was probably in his 50s, with silver gray hair and medium build. I'm not sure why, but I didn't think much of him that maybe he was somewhat sleazy. Just after the movie, ended one of the women sat down next to me and sat on this man's hand. It was as though she was straddling his arm. She had on a short skirt and white hose. He pulled it out from under here from the front. My first impression was that he did it on purpose and I didn't like that. Then I decided not to assume that. I should consider it an accident. However, after that, he was laying on his back on the floor laughing and she straddled him and was acting, playfully, as if she was going to hit him or something for doing it. Then they both got off the floor. Something started to happen at the restaurant. One of the women I was with also worked there. She came from behind the counter and physically stopped the disturbance. I recall seeing her do a karate kick. I realized now the men and women I met in this restaurant, and myself, were police officers. I had come to this place to take a new job. We all got up to head to the police station. They were laughing about my bike. They said something about the rain and I pointed out that the bike had an awning. They led the way to the town and police station with me following on my bike. As we entered the town, I was simply in awe. It almost looked like something out of a Disney village though not really that either. All of the buildings were very colorful and playful. For example, one was white with red storybook lettering. It is very hard to describe. Every building had many compartments on the outside with a separate item in each compartment things like stuffed animals. I loved it. I was trying to take it all in while following them. They stopped at the police station and I missed it. I got frustrated because I had gone down a hill and now I had to peddle back up the hill. The police station and fire station were attached. You didn't realize the police station was there until you went inside. I got off my bike and a man and a young boy came out to help me with my things. I had several duffel bags attached to my bike that I didn't have before. I took two of them off and handed them to the man. After I had folded the bike up again I gave it and one bag to the young boy. He was in awe of my bike. I kept one bag myself. When I went inside, I was in a very narrow, but short, hallway. Part of the way down the hallway I had to take a step down to continue. At the end of the hallway were several rooms. One was an open room. Several women were sitting around a table. I don't know what they were doing. Behind them was an office door. I went in there to meet the man in charge. He was looking for my first day paperwork and couldn't find it. His wife came in to help. He got on the phone and called someone about it. He was frustrated and telling his wife how it would delay my paychecks if it didn't get done on my first day. She was sympathetic but told him she really needed to get started on the next lunch though I knew she meant the dinner meal, or it would be late. I somehow knew she fixed the meals for the whole crew. I was worried about my pay being delayed."
"0164"	"(2001-02-09)"	"I was on a first date. We were at my house, though it wasn't my house in waking life. We were sitting on the sofa talking. I mentioned the movie Stigmata and he said he would like to see it so I put it in for us to watch together. We had kissed 2-3 times. They were very brief, gentle kisses. I thought how nice it was to be with such a gentleman, and someone that I had things in common with. He was laying on the sofa watching the movie and I was sitting behind the back of the sofa taking some bottles of drinks out of their original packages and putting them in a larger box with compartments. Some were beer and some were pink wine coolers. It was the kind of box that wine and liquor bottles come in but there were many more compartments. The bottles were different sizes. Some were very small like those you get on an airplane. One was larger than all the rest. I put more than one bottle in some of the compartments. I don't know why I was doing this. When I was almost done, I realized I was making a lot of noise. About that time, I heard something from my date. I leaned over the back of the sofa and asked what was wrong. He was about to turn the movie off because I was making so much noise with the bottles. I kissed him lightly and told him I was done. Then I lay down on the sofa next to him to watch the rest of the movie. It felt very good being with him."
"0165"	"(2001-02-13)"	"I was lying in bed, naked, but covered with a blanket and sheet. Marshall E came in. I was surprised but happy to see him. I made sure I was totally covered. He sat down on the floor with his back leaning against the bed. A woman named Kate, someone from TV, came in, sat on the floor, and interacted with him. I could tell there was a romantic connection. I thought Oh no, he's not with her. I think it was part jealousy and part thinking that he could do better. The next thing I know he is standing and telling me how much he has missed me, how he still cares for me, and that he has never found anyone to compare. I was acting very coy and thinking that I was flattered, but unsure if I wanted to encourage him to try again."
"0166"	"(2001-02-13)"	"I was talking with Jana S. I was asking about how things are at the sleep center now. I asked how things are between her and Doctor W and she said, no, different."
"0167"	"(2001-02-15)"	"I went to a high school to give a talk. There were TV media there. I was on the gym floor sitting on a bench in the middle of the floor. The students were all on one side in the bleachers. They were very poorly behaved. I said something to the media person with a microphone. It was not until this time that I realized they were students. When I arrived at the school, the driveway and parking were very odd. It was as if I was driving down steps and then had to park on one side angled toward the direction I had come in. When I got ready to leave, I was told I had to leave in the direction I was headed when I came in. This was very awkward because of the direction of the parking I also did not know my way going that way. They told me to go the end, take a left, and then right. That I couldn't get lost. When I turned right, I was in something resembling a very narrow alley, one car width wide. I don't recall seeing building but there was a chain link fence and a lot of gates. Every few hundred feet I had to stop and open a gate. It also kept making turns. I was getting frustrated, upset, and angry. I left my car, threw some kind of very large square board to the side, and continued on foot. I came to a bunch of houses and was walking through their yards trying to figure out where the road to the highway was. I finally asked for directions at one house. A man and woman gave me directions but then she suggested that he take me back to my car and then lead me where I needed to go. He did. As we approached my car, he sympathized with me and told me they shouldn't have done that. He especially pointed out that the place I got out of my car was an especially hard place."
"0168"	"(2001-02-17)"	"It was my wedding day. I did not see or talk to the groom during the entire day. Most of my family was there. They had me standing on one of the dining tables to take my picture. The tables formed a T and I was standing in the cross section facing the top of the T. At another point, Bruce W was kneeling on the longer table facing the same direction to have his picture taken. Somebody was joking around with him. Later I was looking at the pictures and saw that another of my cousin's, Linda W, was standing on the table behind me when they took my picture. She was a bridesmaid and she was dressed in green. Somebody said she was supposed to be there in that picture. The wedding was at Bev's house. It didn't look like her actual house. Nicholas F came running out with this little green umbrella. It was just big enough around to protect him and it was deep with a very short handle. I thought it was so cute and I played with him and the umbrella for a little bit. I was using the bathroom and Nicholas F was standing to my right. I didn't seem to mind that he was there. I realized that I had no pulled the door shut so I reached up and shut it. At that point, Brian F and Mari Kate S came in. I got upset and said can't a person use the bathroom without being disturbed. Mari Kate S let Brian F climb on her back and she carried him out. I got upset because when he climbed on her back he could see over the stall door. It is now near the end of the reception. I am very tired and want to go home. I put on a pair of white socks and my tennis shoes. Bev and I were sitting next to each other leaned against each other waiting to go. We had fallen asleep like that. John S came to awaken us. I asked if it was time to go and he said yes. This is odd because earlier the wedding was at Bev's house but now we are going home to Bev's house. When we get there, I see John set a brown coffee mug down and I asked him if he had trouble staying awake getting home. He said just a little. We went upstairs and I noticed Rachel S's bed. I didn't want to admit that I had not realized that she had not been at the wedding with us. I said that it's a shame Rachel S couldn't be at the wedding. Where has she been? She had been staying with John's parents. Matthew came up to me. He was only about 9 or 10 years old. I hugged him and rested my chin on his head. I asked him if he had a good time. He said not really, because he didn't even get to show me the menu he made for me. I didn't pay much attention to him. I felt really bad."
"0169"	"(2001-02-20)"	"I was at my birth home. We were playing in the woods near the trees with the swings. I don't remember everyone who was there. Bruce W was there. I was getting ready to swing and Bruce W warned me not to get on that one. The chain supporting it was about to break. I went to one of the other swings, a plastic one, and began to lie on my stomach on the swing."
"0170"	"(2001-02-20)"	"I was at a restaurant, like a Denny's. I was having dinner or lunch with someone but I don't know who it was. I went to get something and saw Tim W. I stopped to chat with him. He was there alone. I wanted to sit and talk with him but knew that would be very rude to the person I was with. I thought maybe the other person would leave and then I could join Tim W."
"0171"	"(2001-02-22)"	"I was in a crowded store, like a Target or Wal-Mart, in a checkout line. I was a police officer. There were other police officers there as well. Suzanne B was there also, as a police officer. We were all in checkout lines. There was a criminal of some sort loose in the store. I was the first to spot him coming towards us from the right rear. I yelled, there he is and pointed to him. I was talking mostly to Suzanne B because I thought she had a clear shot of him. He was wearing a tan suit, white shirt and a tie. He was a tall man with brown, balding hair and mustache. After I shouted to Suzanne B, everyone dropped to the floor and I tried to crawl under the register counter. I had just gotten under it when the gunman appeared on the floor right next to me. He handed me his gun and told me to keep it on the crowd. As soon as I had the chance, I began taking shots at the criminal. I took a couple of shots and didn't kill him. I then got very scared. As soon as he turned his back, I shot him a couple more times until I was sure he was dead. It felt awful. I was really shaken up by it. Suzanne B and I were at the police department I think yet it also seemed that we were still somehow at the store. We were at our lockers getting changed and talking about what happened. As we were walking out, I was trying to apply lipstick and tried three times before I actually got it to stay on. We ran into the police chief. He wanted to talk to me primarily about the shooting, at least partially to make sure I was okay. I was dressed in a nice dress and high heels and had fixed my hair. He said something about whenever I walk into a room I get men's attention. He said he observes and always sees at least ten heads turn. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything. The last thing I remember is Suzanne B and I walking out of the store."
"0172"	"(2001-02-26)"	"I was at a hotel for a conference. I met Wes S there. He invited me to come to his room with him and another woman. I was hesitant but, as in the past, had a hard time telling him no. When I got to the room another woman came in also and another man. I noticed a large round pendant around Wes S's neck. It was clear with something red inside of it. I left because I was uncomfortable with the sexual atmosphere in the room. After I left, the room transformed into two large meeting rooms. Many of the employees of the hotel were going in and joining in the activities. The activities remind me of the movie Eyes Wide Shut. As I was walking through the hotel, I overheard members of management getting upset because so many employees were missing. They were going to fire all of them. I decided to just leave. I went to the parking garage to find my car. All of the cars but mine were very expensive cars and limos. Mine looked like an oversized chair. I folded it down and it became a car. As I getting ready to get into my car, I saw Wes S's pendant lying on the ground. I knew it was important to him so I decided to go find him and return it to him. I was walking outside on a second or third floor with an atrium in the middle. I thought I heard Wes S down below. I looked over the rail and he was there. I told him I had his pendant. When I met him to give his pendant back, he apologized profusely for what happened in the room. He said the other women weren't important to him and he asked me to marry him."
"0173"	"(2001-02-26)"	"I was staying at a hotel with people I knew. We were there for some kind of professional conference. I went into an area that looked like a big warehouse. Vendors were sitting around with boxes of their things to set up in booths. One of the vendors was CFC. I was sitting at a table with Lilly H. She told one of the reps that they know if they want our business that they have to bring two of any gifts to her and her co-worker. I said no, they have to bring three, meaning they have to bring one for me also. I went down some steps to go outside. There was a busy street, several lanes wide. I crossed the street to go somewhere. I realized I only had socks on but decided to go ahead. When I came out to go back to the hotel it was raining really hard. I took my socks off and ran barefoot across the street. After I crossed the street, I noticed a place that I could walk under and not get wet as long as I stayed right in the middle. The further I went though the lower the top got. I finally got to a place where I either, had to get on my hands and knees and crawl through this drainage pipe or I had to squeeze through this other opening to my left side. This part is especially odd because the opening couldn't have been more than 12-inch square. I was somewhat concerned that I would get stuck going through there. I thought about my option of the drainage pipe and decided to take my chances with the other opening. It was tight and I got a little nervous after I was halfway through but I got through. The best way I can describe how I got through is what you might see if a cartoonist drew it. When I got back to the hotel, I was having a conversation with my boyfriend. We went and sat down by another woman that he was also dating. I got really upset with her, got in her face, pointed my finger, and told her this conversation does not concern her. I really thought some ugly things about her. I said that I needed to get out of here. I got up and walked away. I knew if I didn't I would say something mean to her and I didn't want to do that. I went outside. The rain had stopped. My boyfriend came after me. He wanted to fix things. I told him I wasn't going to do this anymore. I did not want to hurt his other girlfriend so I was not going to see him anymore. I told him I would fly home the next morning, as I couldn't afford my own hotel room. He did not want to lose me. He begged me to stay and said he would end it with her. I said that wasn't fair to her. I really didn't want to hurt her. I also wanted to respect myself so I would leave. I told him how very much I loved him and how incredibly difficult this would be for me but that in the long run I knew it would be better for all three of us. He said if he was going to lose one of us it would not be me. I finally agreed to stay and let him break it off with her. He got another hotel room. He told me to get just a few things out of our joint room for now. All three of us were in the same room. He said he would get the rest of our things out and bring them to our new room after he had talked with her. I expected it to take awhile but it didn't. He came to the room and said it was time to celebrate. Just at that moment, there was a knock on the door. It was room service with champagne, strawberries and whipped cream, candles, and bubble bath. He said we would take a bubble bath, make love, and then have a wonderful dinner brought to the room. Somehow, I knew that during dinner he was going to ask me to marry him."
"0174"	"(2001-02-27)"	"I was with Nick R. We were living together and sharing a bed but I don't know if we were married or not. I told him I would now need to know what his name really is. He said it is R Williams. We were living in a house in the country. It was very small with maybe 4-5 rooms but I only remember two of the rooms. There were curtains in the doorway between the two rooms. The one small room was divided by a partial wall. I used it for storage. I had to bend over to go through the doorway into that space. There was a window in that space. Before moving into the house, we talked about the fact that we would need to add plumbing. We were talking about the kitchen. There were several people. Kim H, Jody S, Matthew, some other young man, and a young woman who was kind of our housekeeper. Three groups of really rough looking men came into the house without knocking on several occasions. After the last group did this, Nick R left the house with a shovel and something else and I was afraid of what he might be planning to do. He was very angry. He killed and buried several of the men after swearing to me he was done with the Mafia and their ways. He came back dressed kind of like an Indian. He said he put them all in the ground. I was so disappointed in him. Something else happened and we were saying that we needed to go after someone. No one else would so I got on a horse bareback, even though I didn't know how to ride. I had a lot of trouble getting on the horse. I finally did and then chased after that person or those people. We rode to church for Ash Wednesday morning Mass in a wood carriage, like you would see in an old western movie, pulled by a horse. Myself, Matthew, Kim H, and Jody S all went. Nick R didn't go."

"0176"	"(2001-03-03)"	"I was in my apartment with my two sons. It wasn't the same apartment that I actually live in and I only have one son. We were sitting at a counter, on stools, and getting ready to eat some ice cream. Someone had given us a gift of gourmet ice creams. They were special shapes and flavors. My younger son, not Matthew, was using a spoon and digging into the middle of lots of them to try each one without choosing one and finishing it. I scolded him and told him not to do that. Three of the ice creams were flat and round, like tostados. One was pink. One was blue. There was third as well. They had sprinkles or something like that on them also. Some of them were bars that stood on their side and had two sticks in them. There was a man and a woman to the right behind Matthew. I don't remember what they were doing there. As we finished the ice cream, I started cleaning up and there was a large, African American woman sitting on a table to my left. She had her back to me and was on the phone. She was wearing cultural clothing. I realized that she was about to sit in some ice cream so I nudged her to sit up a bit so I could wipe it up before she sat in it. I was thinking about moving my computer downstairs. I thought it would be a nice change of scenery and I would get more sunlight."
"0177"	"(2001-03-04)"	"It was a wedding. The men in the wedding party had on blue plaid shirts and vests with no ties. I was checking their neckline as they proceeded in. I tried to straighten Bob F's out as he went in. The wedding took place in a room that was kind of like a small meeting room. I don't remember the wedding itself. I don't even know who was getting married. After the wedding was over, we opened the door to let the other guests in. there wasn't really room for them because there were dining tables set up that took up the whole room. We told them it was standing room only. We had to eat in shifts. There is dancing in the room. The tables were gone. We had some chairs set up around the perimeter of the room I was trying to make as much room as I could and have seats for people. There was bunch of junk in the room. Like tables along the wall with stuff piled on them. We were dancing and having a good time but not many people would come in. I don't know why but it seems that Alan K was there because I don't remember seeing him or anything. I just have this sense that he was in it. It also seems like there were two separate wedding dreams. At another one, the room setting was very similar but I went in and Uncle H and Aunt R were sitting there eating. There was a woman and an empty seat between them. I thought that maybe she could move over one so there would be two seats together but I don't think I actually said this. It might have been this one that I remember something about the women in the wedding party. The colors were pink, white, and black. Just one of the bridesmaids had a black bow in her hair. They all had pink or white dresses on with opposite color bows in their hair. One of the bridesmaids was Phoebe."
"0178"	"(2001-03-04)"	"I was with my CRHP sisters. Some details are very, very sketchy. I stepped into this area where I was going to be wrapped up like a postal package. We could decide what kind of wrapping we wanted. I decided plain brown wrapper with white string. When I stepped into the spot, Tom Hanks appeared and did the wrapping. He was having a lot of fun doing it. I was so excited. He was really, really nice to me. It was as if it was some kind of game. Later I was with just a few friends and there was one or two children. I thought it was odd that we were dressed in swimsuits and robes but they said that was the typical dress for where we were going, to just put a robe over your swimsuit. Then I saw we were going to a swimming pool. At the pool, there was a large group of men sitting all around in their street clothes. I realized this was another joke. They had arranged for all these men to be there. They said they wanted to see me in a swimsuit. I let my robe fall open a bit and pretended not to notice as I continued to talk to my friends. I finally took my robe off, got into the pool, and swam the width of the pool. After I got to the other side, I got out and saw all the men were gone. They said they were only there to see me in a swimsuit so as soon as they did they all got up and left. One of my women friends was surprised that I didn't look half-bad in a swimsuit. I felt pretty confident but also recognized the areas where it was obvious that I need to lose weight. I went to get back in the pool and there was this thing, reminds me of a mattress cover, covering the entire area of the pool. I lay down on top of it. It was very relaxing. I was back in my room. I'm confused as to whether it was a hotel. I think not. I was with my CRHP sisters again. We were putting some things away. There were Christmas decorations and Halloween costumes. I was dividing them into piles because they each needed to go to different rooms. I took the Christmas stuff to two different places. Then I took the Halloween stuff to another place. BJ was on a ladder and I handed her the costumes on hangers. She wasn't sure what to do with them and then turned around and saw others hanging above and behind her. She asked if I was sure that this is where they were supposed to go. I said yes. I was thinking that this is where they are kept for storage until it is time to get them out. I was at NTNS. Someone else and I are carrying these things into an attic, kind of like the one in my birth home. I think Bob F was one of the ones helping. I was separating things into piles by the boxes they would go in. Several of us were in the attic and I pointed out that we needed to start digging out the boxes. Nobody really wanted to because it was going to be a big hassle. I can still picture it in my mind but I don't know how to describe it. I leave and am back at my home/apartment/hotel. We are supposed to be getting ready to go to a play. I realize that I am the last one to get ready and the others are trying to be patient in waiting for me. I am rushing around trying to get ready as quickly as possible. I end up having to change a thing or two. Suzanne B is worried that we are going to be late but I can see she is trying very hard to be patient. I put on my black satin suit and decided to wear flats instead of heels since we were in a hurry. They were quicker to grab and I could walk faster. When we were headed out, we went through this area that looked like a building under construction again. Tom Hanks was there again and pretended that he was going to wrap me up again. This time he said he was just playing around and was just there to walk me to the car and say good-bye. I asked if I could give him a hug and kiss. I intended to just kiss him on the cheek. He leaned over and gave me a very light, quick kiss on the lips and a big hug. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. I was so excited. He walked me to the car. When we got to the play, I was suddenly with Mother and Daddy. I told Daddy to go and ahead and Mother and I would catch up. It seemed like we were someplace like Las Vegas. Once inside I was back with my CRHP sisters. We were standing around talking. I was telling them about Tom Hanks. Several of them told me that Sheila G had arranged all of that for me specifically. I walked through the crowd of them to Sheila G. Sheila G appeared to me as Tracy P, but I knew it was Sheila G. I thought, oh yeah, she has a job where she has contact with or access to these stars. I thanked her profusely for what she had arranged with Tom. I was very excited. There was another part, but I'm not sure where it fits in here. Someone had arranged for a seal, an actual animal, to come to my room as a date. I was very upset and was trying to hold the door so it couldn't get in. It was trying to squeeze in under the door. I was trying to hold the bottom of the door with one hand while grabbing things to block the door and the seal with another. I grabbed a few items and was finally able to block the door and get enough weight against it so the seal couldn't get in. The seal left but then came back later and tried again. I did the same thing but this time I eventually got enough things in front of the door that I could move away long enough to move furniture in front of the door as well. I needed that to keep the seal out that time, as he seemed more determined than ever to get. The furniture successfully kept him out."
"0179"	"(2001-03-05)"	"I was living in an apartment in the city. I was setting up my computer in a chair. I was trying to kind of stack it so it would stay in place against the back of the chair and I was going to use it that way. I was trying to figure out a way to set it so I could easily access the A drive. I was also changing my clothes at the same time. I went out to go to a nearby store to get something related to the computer but I don't remember what. It was raining. I think the place that I went into was kind of like a mall but it was fairly narrow and it was as if I was walking through one store and then another to get to each store. When I got to the store, I was looking for I went to the counter and was discussing my needs with a young man there. An older man came out. I realized it was Mike M. I didn't acknowledge that it was him, nor did he acknowledge that it was I. He came up to the counter and joined in the discussion. I realized that my clothes were lying around and I quickly grabbed them up, embarrassed for him to see that, especially since my bra was lying there to. I embarrassingly said, Sorry, I was changing my clothes while I was working. I'm sure he knew it was me because he has seen a picture of me. I haven't seen a picture of him so I don't know how I knew it was him. We finished our discussion and I rushed out of the store, back through the other stores, and out into the rain."
"0180"	"(2001-03-06)"	"I ate a mouse. I cooked it or something, put it with something else like a pasta sauce. I cut the head and tail off, cut the rest of it up and ate it. I hated doing it but knew I needed to. There were other parts that I picked out that were long, bony pieces. I picked out some bones that looked like hipbones still connected to each other. It was making me gag. I told some people later that I had done this. Julien D was one of those people. There was snow outside. Someone had made a magnificent snow sculpture. It was lit with strategically placed lights and it also was kind of like a waterfall. Two pieces of the sculpture were lion's heads. My waking somatic response was horrible. I felt nauseous, my blood was tingling, and I was shaking."

"0182"	"(2001-03-11)"	"Group of people, built a home, garage, shower, woods, one special man. I went to take a shower in my birth home. There was all kinds of stuff in there. Many other non-family members had used the shower but left things lying in the tub. I was thinking that they should pick up after themselves. That someone should say something to them. I went out to the far right corner of the woods and climbed over the fence. A whole group of people did this."

"0184"	"(2001-03-12)"	"I was at WDF. There was a section of the plant that was like a doctor's office or hospital. The nurses were taking my blood pressure but they didn't know which number was systolic and which was diastolic. I tried to tell them that the 118 was the upper number as that was pretty normal for me. They didn't believe me. They took it twice. They were worried that it was much too high so they were going to have someone else take it again. This person pumped the sleeve up and then walked away to do something else without reading it. She thought she would be back in time to read it. She did this twice. She apologized for getting distracted and told me to take a break and come back. I went to find a bathroom. They told me where I had to go out into the plant. I did. There were two Port-o-Lets out there. One for men and one for women. There were men working around there and I was afraid that the ones working up high would be able to see down in through the top. I realized that the top was covered with something dome shaped. I went in. One of the sidewalls had an opening down to my waist. I decided they couldn't see too much from that angle so I was going to go ahead and use it. Then I realized that there was no toilet in it so I went back out. I got some lunch but I don't remember how, where or what. I was sitting on the floor with some other people watching an interview. I realized that it was Kendall B that they were interviewing. I was so excited. I was eager to hear his voice again and to hear what he had to say. As I was sitting there, Vince P came up behind Kendall B and motioned to me. I was also excited to see him so I went out to talk to him. He said he decided to come there because I had tried to get in touch with him. I asked how he, Sue P and his family were. I actually asked twice but he didn't answer me. He looked great, as always, but was wearing his hair in a different style. We were suddenly outside in a neighborhood. 2-3 other cars were driving crazy and almost hit his car. We were walking and I was looking through the trees for his car. I wanted to see what he was driving. I don't think I ever saw it. He started telling me about this girl he had seen a few times but decided not to see her again. I was reading his description of his experience with her. He was describing their experience making love, though his description was cryptic rather than using the exact terms. He decided not to see her again because she enjoyed sex too much. This seemed odd to me since I was often put off by his sexual interests. In this thing I was reading, she said she would try to be more quiet. I don't know how to explain the paper I was reading. I was using my hands to pull it out a little at a time as I read it. Kind of like I was unrolling and rolling it as I read. The letters were very large and various bold colors. There were also flowers on it. I went back inside for them to take my blood pressure again. There was a head nurse who had just started working there. She had been taking inventory of supplies, cleaning up, and organizing. I looked out a window and saw her mowing the grass and some really tall weeds and such. My first thought was how much I enjoy mowing grass. Then I noticed that she had a really heavy-duty mower. It was mowing down tree trunks that were approximately 1 inch in diameter. I wished I had a mower like that. Then I thought it was sad that she was cutting down the tall stuff and destroying the natural environment like that. I climbed up and sat on a cabinet. It had a warped wood surface. I wondered if it would hold me or what they would say, so I only sat on it partially. I decided to ring the nurse call button. I was surprised at how loud it was. Someone came and looked at the call screen to see who rang them, then looked at me. It was Rosemary P. I told her what had been going on and that I was still waiting. I saw Gale W in the background. Rosemary P told me I wasn't supposed to skip a meal and I told her that I had just eaten."
"0185"	"(2001-03-12)"	"Matthew and I were at a Value City store. He was returning something and I was going to have my class ring sized. There was a long line moving very slowly. Some people cut us off. Mother was in the line standing next to me. She said, There's two lines. I said, no, there is only one line and that woman cut us off, and pointed to her. Mother let us get back in line ahead of her. The next thing I knew, Ola S was in line in front of me. She was very short. less than 4 feet. She was carrying on like she always does. When it was her turn she couldn't see over the counter. I took the paper that the clerk was trying to hand to her and gave it to her. When it was my turn, I asked how long it would take. She said she could resize the ring as soon as she took care of all the people in line. I was very reluctant to let her keep the ring. I told her that the ring is very valuable. The line was so long that I didn't think she would get to it before the store closed so I decided not to leave it with her. I thought I should probably take it to a jewelry store anyway. After I got out of line I decided to go look at rugs. They didn't have the right color for the upstairs bathroom. All they had was a rose color. I thought about how that would look. I decided that I needed one for the downstairs bathroom more. They had the right color but I was afraid it was too big."
"0186"	"(2001-03-12)"	"I pulled into a parking lot at night. It was raining. I parked pretty far away and ran in. As I was running in I realized that there several parking spaces closer but it didn't really bother me. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella. I was in an appliance store. I was looking for a small TV for my office that I could also move around easily and that would not be very expensive. The aisles were very narrow. I had to squeeze through some of them. The store was packed with products and people. I was looking around and finally spotted the TV section. There were microwaves mixed in with the TV's. I accidentally opened a microwave and shut it right away, hoping no one had noticed. I was afraid they would realize that I had mistaken the microwave for a TV. I was looking for a TV around $200. I kept seeing price tags of $400 and more though I think there was one around $200 but I didn't especially care for it."
"0187"	"(2001-03-13)"	"I had a meeting with Al H and quite a few other people at WDF. In front of this group of my peers he asked me to go make copies. I confronted him and got irate that he chose me, a doctoral student, to go make copies for him. It was a huge stack of papers and most of them were two sided. Al H came up to me and started yelling at me for confronting him but then stormed away back to the meeting. After the incident with Al H I thought about calling Deb U and asking her to say something to him about how inappropriate it was for him to ask me to run copies. When I ran out of paper I debated whether I should go to him and ask for money to go purchase paper to finish making the copies or if I could just order some and wait for it to get there to finish making the copies. It was a huge stack of papers that I was making copies of. Instead of asking Al H for money, I was going all over looking for more paper. When I was doing this I seemed to be at the DDSI office. I found some labels that were clear with red print on them. Some of them were labels of my name. I thought it was curious that they still had labels with my name on them in the office."
"0188"	"(2001-03-14)"	"I was in a store kind of like a Wal-Mart or Target. I was standing at a magazine rack going through loose pages of the yellow pages looking for information about exercise equipment. Twice clerks came up to me and pointed out there exercise equipment but I told them I was looking for something very specific. I think I was looking for something like the ab roller that I use at the Y. I started to walk away and I walked by this counter. There was a man and two women there. The two women were making a strawberry milkshake. I saw one put a scoop of vanilla ice cream into the blender. I said, Now that's what I'm looking for. They said, do you really want it? I said sure. But I had to find a glass to put it in. I told them to hold on a second, that I would go get my other one. I went to get it but it had chocolate all over the inside. I went to grab something else, it was a blender beaker as well, but it had chocolate in it too. I told them I would just go to the refreshment counter and get a cup from them. They said, You're going to buy one for that? I said I would if they wouldn't just give me one. The next thing I know, though, I am standing at the refreshment counter with the shake in an actual glass. I pick up a lid, though it doesn't snap onto the glass and I stick a straw through the lid and I leave. As I was leaving the store I noticed a penny on the cement. I was happy as I always am to find a penny and said the Our Father as I always do when I find a penny. But as I bent over to pick it up I saw another one. When I reached for it I realized there was a lot of change on the sidewalk right there. So I started picking it all up and putting in the pockets of my jacket. My jacket was white knit so the change in the pockets pulled it down a lot in front. Some of the change was in piles and had 50 cent pieces and silver dollars and quarters in it. I was so excited to find all this change. An elderly, gray-haired lady walked by and said something to me but I don't remember what she said. Right after she went in the store Karen M and Laura Bi came out. Then they said something to me but I also don't remember what they said."
"0189"	"(2001-03-15)"	"I was with a female roommate. It was Jacqueline Smith, the actress. Maybe I wasn't with her. She went into the apartment and this man was there. She had a condom and he had one too. One was lying on a bedside table. He said see, we're supposed to have sex, and we're supposed to do it twice. Something else happened and he said something to confirm that too. She did. After they both had their clothes off, he got under the blanket and then came out with a small axe and started slitting her throat. I was there at that point, because I ran out and I tried slamming doors shut behind me and locking them. I ran out into a neighbor's house and knocked on their front door and hid behind a bush so he wouldn't see me if he came after me. I think he did. I think he took me back to the apartment. When I got into the apartment I went into a room and pushed the door shut and tried pushing a bookshelf in front of it. That wasn't strong enough to keep him out. I realized I would have to push more bookshelves against it to keep him out."
"0190"	"(2001-03-16)"	"I was an officer in some kind of military unit. I had my unit out. All of them were standing together in one room. There were a lot of them. I was in another room. I went into my room and there were three light switches but none of them would work. There was just a hole there. It was pitch black dark in the room. So I went back to where my unit was and I had one of them come with me. Actually, several of them came with me. They went in and found a couple of lights and turned them on and got the lights working so I could turn them on from the switches. The one farthest from me was missing so they rigged it so it would always be on. It was a small light that would be on all the time. The other room was kind of like three sections and one section was all the men. The next section was two women; one might have been an officer whose rank was between mine and the rest of the unit. The last section was two more women in separate beds. When we got the lights working in my room I came back into their room and I grabbed two pillows from that last bed and took them into my room. The men that I took with me had been drinking. I decided to go for a drive and get something to eat. When I did I saw one of the members of my unit out there. I sat and watched and saw his pregnant wife there too. He was beating her and she lashed back, apparently had just taken self-defense lessons so he wouldn't be able to do this to her anymore. She fought back and trapped him on the ground between two trash dumpsters and then walked away and I did too. I just left him there and called the police and told them that there had been. I don't know. I told them they could find this man there. I was looking for a fast food restaurant. I pulled into one and realized it was a drive-in restaurant, like Dogs N' Suds, so I backed out and left. I was having trouble seeing because I was driving from the back seat, right side and something on the seat in front of me kept moving around blocking my vision. I was afraid I was going to have a wreck. I passed a Burger King but it was closed and dark. An image of a little Indian woman - just a bit shorter than me."
"0191"	"(2001-03-16)"	"I was with BJ and I think someone else. We were going to a strip mall or drove by one. It was the strip mall where SFI was but it was completely redone so that I hardly recognized it. All the stores were on the same level as the parking rather than having to go up steps to get to them. The outdoor mall in front of T.J. Maxx was now filled in. The outside was mostly white with bright pretty colors for accents and signs. I pointed out SFI and told BJ that is where I used to work but commented on how different it looked and also pointed out some of the differences. We went inside. I couldn't believe how different it looked. It was a long, narrow store. With new pretty fixtures. There was very little merchandise. I don't even remember seeing any clothing. There was a very long sales counter. All of the people working in the store were Caucasian. I asked if Lisa S was still the DM and they said no. I wondered if I would be able to get in touch with her. Somebody was after me and I was standing in front of a counter just like this. One of the employees pulled out a rifle and told whoever it was chasing me to get out before they called the police."
"0192"	"(2001-03-17)"	"This dream was about the research group, about the meeting coming up tomorrow night. Pam Ta arrived early and added her pieces to the group collage. Her and Sophia K put their things on the floor and started working on their individual collages. I wasn't really paying attention. I heard them talking, but I wasn't really paying attention. Pretty soon I noticed that Pam Ta had almost finished hers and at that point I said something. She said she needed to leave early so that's why she went ahead and did hers. I then looked at Sophia K and she had done her individual collage on the group collage. She went ahead and did hers also but she also did it on the group collage. I was frustrated with this because they started without the rest of the group and because once again Sophia K had not followed instructions. Of course, Sophia K reasoned that it wasn't going to matter, there was absolutely nothing wrong with what she had done. With Pam Ta I felt a little better about it because I knew she had to leave early. I started taking pictures and when the rest of the group got here they started discussing Pam Ta's. I said, Now, wait a minute. Can we discuss this without it affecting our own at all. Of course, they all thought that we could. I was out in the parking lot with everyone and saying something to Dan M while he was in his car."
"0193"	"(2001-03-17)"	"My extended family and I had gone to something like a carnival with a picnic lunch. Carnival is the closest I can come to describing it though it was indoors. All of my siblings and their children and my parents were there. When we got there, Jonathan F and I took off. We spent the day with some mobsters and some Indians. We had a really good time. The mobsters were all very nice. We sat and played checkers with them and talked with them. The Indians taught us things. They taught us to make some little tools. One was a tool to fish with. They showed us how to fish with it. When we got back to the rest of the family they had all eaten already and were almost ready to go home. Jonathan and I walked away again to get something to drink. We found some cups but we had to try several soft drink machines before we found one that worked. Then we went back to the family and started helping them load up the vehicles. Bob F had his van and the rest of us rode in the back of an open-bed truck. There was a tray that had deviled eggs and raspberry tarts on it. The tarts looked like round biscuits, cut open and stuffed with raspberry pie filling. Someone commented on how good the tarts were but that we forgot to eat them. When we were loading up they all got eaten but one. I took half of that one and someone else took the other. But when I took it, it was more like toast with raspberry pie filling on it and some little round or square things on top. It wasn't nearly as good as the others looked. I took the tray of deviled eggs out and when I got out there I realized that there was another tray of eggs too and that I should have combined them. I also realized I should have covered them with plastic wrap before I brought them out. I asked someone to hold them so I could go in and get some plastic wrap but they didn't. I thought about trying to balance them on the truck while I was wrapping them. Then I thought I should just take them back inside and wrap them but I don't remember doing that. There were also all of these trays of cookies. Everybody got everything loaded up and in the truck except me. I was going to sit in the same place that I sat going there. I had to pull out this thing and there was a plastic container for me to sit in. But someone had filled it with cookies for Bev to take to her in-laws. So, we had to take all of the cookies out. BJ said she needed to go buy tickets to a Reds game. Daddy backed the truck up to the lines where she was buying the tickets. But he almost hit some people. I was yelling at him to stop and he just barely stopped in time without hitting anyone. BJ came back out and said that there were no tickets left for the entire season. One of her kids, I think Todd A, was very upset at this. Todd A was a lot younger than in waking life. Somebody said one of the reasons they were all sold out was because of a Cobb wedding. The Cobb's had purchased every seat in the stadium. Bev said to us that it sounded like the Cobb's. Somebody else said they had some tickets to sell. They started out saying they had some $12 seats and asked if anyone was interested in those. Nobody was. Then they said they had some $15 dollar seats. Then, somebody said here's two seats for $250 each. Somebody bought those. It turned out they were Kim H's tickets that she sold. She was really excited about this. We went ahead and started leaving. Daddy was backing up the truck, but it seemed more like he was just letting it roll and not paying attention to where it was rolling or not aware that it was rolling. I yelled at him again to stop because he was about to back into things. He was about to back into a soda machine. Then he almost hit some gas tanks, and then a couple of other things. He finally stopped the truck and said, I don't know what you were yelling about. I said, because you just missed hitting all of this stuff. Daddy started driving and I was actually walking along the truck. When he came to a stoplight I leaned my back and hands against a wall to try to get into the box. Bob F and Bill F helped get my legs in. Then I pulled on Bill F to get myself in the rest of the way. Once I was in we had to put all of these cookies back in around me. Bev was telling me which ones to put where and how to put them in because there were several different kinds.  "
"0194"	"(2001-03-18)"	"The SVSDC was being expanded. They had remodeled all of the storage cabinets in the sleep area. They looked like kitchen cabinets. All of the doors were etched glass with white knobs. The cabinets were white. It was cool the way they were expanding the building. They had a forklift and they just lifted one of the walls and moved it out further. When I was walking around, there were quite a few patients standing around and two of them were in bed. One was Brandy C. I asked someone if she was having another sleep study. I was standing at this sink cleaning out something that was shaped like a lint roller but it was metal and had holes and things sticking out of it. It had some really goopy stuff in it and I was standing there gagging as I was cleaning it. Anne Marie [unknown in waking life] was standing on the other side of the sink facing me and told me that it's just mucus. There was also this other woman standing to my right. It was a woman from ER. The one that sponsors Carter but I can't remember her name. She was more sympathetic. I wouldn't even say what it was that I was cleaning out. Then I had this piece of meat, maybe a steak, while I was standing there at the sink. I wanted to lay it down and wanted someone to grab a plate for me. Instead this other woman laid a huge piece of raw salmon on the counter and I laid the steak on top of it. I had put a bunch of Rolodex cards into a Rolodex and it was overflowing. They didn't want to buy another one so I went to the sleep area to see if I could find another one in storage. While I was back there, I started talking to Susan J. We were both complaining about things they had done back there. They didn't want us to spend money on office supplies but yet they had all the cabinet doors replaced with this expensive engraved glass. I also noted that all of the cabinets had kitchenware like glasses and plates instead of the normal sleep center supplies. I had an idea about what I could do for the Rolodex. I saw this three-sectioned container on the desk that could be readjusted and made into a Rolodex so I went back to the office to try that. I was talking to one of the construction workers about the expansion. I said, pretty soon, we're going to be all the way out to the road. He said that the plan was to eventually take over the whole lot. I said, 'yes, I realize that."
"0195"	"(2001-03-18)"	"I was at my birth home with Bev, Bill F, and Brian F. The house had been sold and the people who had bought it came to work in the yard. I heard a lot of noise outside so I went to look out the window. I tried to do it so they wouldn't see me. I saw them using the rotary tiller in the flowerbeds by the backside of the porch. I knew daddy had told them they could use the lawn mower but I didn't know if this was okay. I wanted to call and let them know. None of us could remember the new phone number. We called BJ because we knew she would know it. When I got her on the phone, she gave me the number. One of the others handed me two pieces of paper but they were full of writing and I wasn't sure where to write the number down so I gave the pen to Bill F and told him to write it down. I talked to BJ about something else too. Mother and daddy showed up before I could call them. They were fine with what the new owners were doing. We went out to the garage. There were a lot of people sitting out there. Daddy pulled some grape branches down from the ceiling of the garage for Brian F to help him pick. I was so excited because I love grapes. There were green and purple ones both. I reached up and daddy pulled some branches down for me some to pick also but the ones he gave me just had single grapes on them instead of bunches so I had to pick them one at a time. After I finished I accidentally grabbed someone's foot. I looked at daddy and said I guess I can't pick the big toe can I? Or the others either? I felt embarrassed that I thought for a second that I could pick them. Daddy was sitting with some other men now and he told me there were more grapes up in the rafters but I would just have to climb up there to get them. I stepped on the bench between him and some other man to get myself up to the rafters. When I got up there, I turned around, looked down, and saw Aunt H and Aunt P were there with Aunt R. Aunt R looked really healthy, like she did years ago. She was standing and talking. At first, I didn't see any grapes in the rafters. Then I noticed some on the other side but didn't know how to get over there. There was a small beam that I could scoot across to get over there but it seemed scary to me, even though I knew I had done it before. The beam had stuffed store all along it and I didn't know if there was room for me. I also realized I could get down and climb back up the other side but that seemed like a pain. I did end up on the other side but I don't know how. When I got over there I saw bunches of grapes in bags like the kind you find in at a grocery store. These were all green. I thought this is great. I can freeze a bunch of these. Then I realized that some of them were already frozen. I then noticed that there were also packages of frozen meat up there. I didn't think about it then but I don't know how this stuff could have been frozen because it was just a storage space for all kinds of stuff/junk. The next scene I was talking to this black woman who couldn't walk on her own but I'm not sure how or why. She had pulled herself up by this cart, kind of like a hot dog vendor cart. She was going to try to walk around using that as a support. This man came in and she said something to him about being able to get around now and wanting to go on a date. We agreed to baby-sit the kids but I have no idea whose kids we were talking about except that it wasn't theirs. He finally agreed. Then I'm back up in the rafters and I see two stuffed dummies. The kind you might find sitting on a porch at Halloween where someone had stuffed clothes to make it look like a person. They were hanging from the rafters. They looked just like the two people that were going out on a date. The female dummy had her back to the male dummy and he had his arms around the female dummy as though he was supporting her. I saw other dummies hanging up there as well."
"0196"	"(2001-03-19)"	"I was at a business conference in a hotel. Carmen A was there. Terri O was there. Angie Ho and Darren H and Annie H. I was in my room trying to change clothes. Angie Ho, Darren, and Annie H were there. I didn't have any clothes on and neither did Angie Ho. They all just stayed in the room, sat down, and started talking. I finally went in my closet and closed the door thinking they would get the hint and leave, but they didn't. I finally stuck my head out and said I really don't mean to be rude, but can I have some privacy? Angie Ho gave me this dirty look. I closed the door back up and they finally left. I got dressed and went out. Myself, Terri O, other CIIS group members were cleaning. We were getting ready for some execs. One of the men in charge came up to us and told us not to forget to clean this part of the banister at the bottom of the steps so I grabbed a rag and went down and cleaned it right away so we wouldn't forget. A few minutes later we were doing something else and he came by and looked at it then looked at it and then looked at us and smiled that we had remembered. It was really dusty and dirty. We went back upstairs and there was this little dog up there. It was a longhaired small dog. I asked what breed it was. The fur was really soft but it looked kind of like a beagle. Terri O said, no, it was a boxer. I was really surprised. When I looked at the face again I could kind of see the resemblance. There was this little puppy there too. The puppy was playing with the boxer. I thought, oh that boxer is so sweet I think I would like to have one like that. It kind of snipped at the puppy's mouth. I told it not to do that. Well, so much for that! I thought I wanted that dog! I know I don't now. The same man came back and was pointing out this painting, and said that the name was wrong on it. He said it was his son and that we needed to correct the signature on it. We did. He came by later and said tell them the story to point out that it was still wrong. I said, I'm sorry, I don't understand. Someone said the initials are supposed to be A.C. not S.A. Then after the man walked away I asked, why didn't he say that instead of telling us this whole story? Why didn't he just say, It's supposed to be A.C.? Then I walked into this conference room with this one man. I'm not sure who it was. I feel that I knew him but I can't identify him. We went in and sat down at a table to listen to a speaker. We were at a table with Carmen A and two of her friends. Her hair was really big and I touched it. It was hard with hair spray. She turned around and said, It looks really nice, doesn't it? I said, yes, it does. I didn't really think so. Then I went to another table to get a coffee cup. I came back, poured myself some coffee, and put an extraordinary amount of sweetener in it. I was looking for cream. I realized that I had to go to the back of the room to another table to get some cream. I didn't really want to but I realized that it was coffee with caffeine and I knew the effect it would have on me and I thought the creamer but lessen the effect somewhat. They didn't have any decaf so I went ahead and drank it because I really wanted coffee."
"0197"	"(2001-03-20)"	"I was with some of my family and I went to visit my house on Lakeland Dr. There were priests living in it now. As I walked around, the floor plan wasn't the same as it was in waking life. But I recognized things and was enjoying going through it. I looked out the window and pointed out that they had replaced our deck with something else. The fence that they had put up was kind of gaudy. It had big, thick, black posts with horse heads on the top. It was shiny. I don't know what the material was. if it was painted wood or some kind of metal. I was looking for my refrigerator. I finally walked into one room and there were two of them and one was mine. I said to Mother there it is and we went and looked specifically at the ice and water dispenser. After we left the house I realized that I had not looked at the kitchen or family room. I am planning to open my own store. I don't know what kind of store. I asked BJ and someone else to help me make a sign. I was going to put an advertisement in the church bulletin and someplace else and I thought we could make a poster board sign that would look like a real sign and then take a picture of it for in the ad. I was thinking of the kind of wood sign that you would find hanging out from the building outside of a store. like in the movie chocolate. BJ complained at first but then agreed to help. It was going to be pink lettering on a white background. I'm not sure where we are working on this. At first I thought we had room to work on them in my parents bedroom. But we were in this very large room with several large tables. all of my CRHP sisters are there to help but we aren't at my parents house. I have a sense that we are back at the rectory but it doesn't seem at all like my house on Lakeland so I'm not sure where we were. I had started making the sign. My CRHP sisters decided what kind of signs to make without asking me and had them done really quickly. They had made one for each holiday. They used lots of different colors. They just used large white paper instead of poster board. And they got rid of my initial sign of white poster board with pink lettering. They didn't say much about why they did that. They knew that I noticed but they kind of ignored it. I know they were all there but the ones I specifically remember were Theresa Ay, Theresa S, Judy D, Linda B, and Sheila G. We talked about how to transport these to my home or store. They said we could crease them but it was better not to. If we were going to fold them over without creasing, we should fold them over with the print on the inside. They had lots of glitter on them also. They were pretty but reminded me of things children would have made. which was not what I had wanted at all. I had wanted something simulating a real sign. Some of us folded the signs over and carried them outside to put in a car to take to my home. Others just let them hang freely and carried them out. Some of them had tape on the ends as though to hang them. They had also brought with them these huge containers of cookies and sweet rolls and such. We talked a little about what kind of store I was going to open. I joked that I was going to be a chocolatier. But the more I said it the more I liked the idea. I still don't know what I was going to do. When we got done with the signs we had to do something with all of these cookies. We started dividing them up among us so we each had a selection of everything. Most of us were putting ours in these huge roasting pans the size that would be used to serve a very large party. Some of them didn't want to take very many and were putting theirs in small plastic containers. Every time I thought we were done I would fine 2-3 more pans or trays. People started leaving and there were still pans of cookies left. I think we finally ended up getting them all divided except one final pan of chocolate cookies with chocolate chips. I asked whom all the empty pans belonged to. Some of them were the tin foil pans but there were also plastic containers. Some of the plastic ones I recognized as my own. There were two plastic ones that had pull out drawers. In each drawer were two recipe boxes. I looked inside the recipe boxes and they were empty. As we were loading up our cars I mentioned that I was looking for a new place to live. Someone said this would be a good time for me to move closer to the northeast side of town since Matthew will be leaving for college. I said I agreed but then stated that I already live on the NE. I don't know why I was moving or if I was trying to buy a condo or house again or just moving into another apartment. Some of my CRHP sisters wanted to go look at it with me before I decided for sure. I said that was fine and that we would see when they were available and go then. I was asking Theresa Ay for sure. At first I thought they could meet me at work and we would go from there then I realized that was a lot of extra driving for them so I would just give them the address and directions and meet them there."
"0198"	"(2001-03-22)"	"We had these typed job descriptions. I found one that matched me very well. I was very excited about it. I was putting it in a glass frame."
"0199"	"(2001-03-23)"	"Matthew came in a room and asked me for a phone number for himself not for MC. One night he didn't have to use his phone card number."
"0200"	"(2001-03-24)"	"There were four deaths. Two female children, one male child, and one female adult. There was some kind of military accident. It was civilians that got killed. I see these planes crash and I could see them underwater. It was as though I was looking through a glass tank. I could see all the planes nosedive down and hit the bottom of the ocean. The men got out and were all dressed in white uniforms, that looked like astronaut uniforms. They grabbed a pull-cord and something inflated and pulled them to the surface of the water. Shortly after that, I was at the funeral for these four people. It was as if I was having the dream of the mother of these four children. I was dreaming inside a dream that I was cleaning up the faces of these children. I had to sew up the boy's face, right down the middle of his chin and down around his chin. Then he was good as new and came back to life. I did the same thing with one of the girls."
"0201"	"(2001-03-24)"	"I was driving through my mother's hometown. I had a young girl with me. I think she was African American. We came home and we were getting ready for bed. She ran into this bedroom a couple of times to this old woman to say goodnight. Where we were sleeping was surrounded by bookshelves. Some of the bookshelves formed like a square with just a little entryway. I was sleeping inside there and she was sleeping on the other side of one of the bookshelves. I gave her my blue sleeping bag and told her she could use it either as a sleeping bag or a comforter. She had hoped she would get to sleep on a bed and I told her no. I told her to go into the other bedroom and get a pillow off the bed to use. She brought those out and then she went into the older woman's bedroom again to say goodnight one more time. I kept telling her she had to be very quiet."
"0202"	"(2001-03-24)"	"I was at Mother and Daddy's house and I was over in the side yard where we used to play ball. I was flying. There were these big square beams every few feet. I was flying under them I think and kind of hitting them as I flew under them. At the last one, there were two of them close together and they had a platform between them. I was crawling on that platform eating salad like a dog as I went along. Then I came to this baby. I realized it was a homeless baby. I saw this woman sitting down below so I took the baby to her. I asked her if she wanted a baby. She was so happy. She kept asking me if I was sure. Are you sure this is okay? She didn't want to take it if it was someone else's baby. I said, no, someone else deserted it, so you may have it. Then the baby started crying and I went to get it some milk. There was a handicapped young man sitting there and he was putting something in the baby bottle that he shouldn't. I told him, don't ever, ever put that in the bottle again because that will really, really hurt the baby. I took a bottle and cleaned it out really good. Then I made some formula, put it in, and took it to Ross [unknown] ."
"0203"	"(2001-03-24)"	"I was inside this house. It was a big fancy house. There was a party there. The owner of the house was Dabney Coleman. I think he's kind of gross. We were in this house and he made a pass at me. Then he took me into his bedroom, but there were all these other people in there. Actually, the bedroom was kind of like a very large suite of rooms with no doors, just large openings between areas. It was almost as though it was partitioned off rather than having walls. It was very contemporary. Everything had very contemporary curvy lines to them. I really don't know how to explain this at all. Anyway, he chased all the people out. I whispered something to him. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get all of them out. When he finally got them all out, we realized his wife was there. She was talking to him and flirting with him physically as though nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door and instead of running down two flights of steps, I jumped over the rail and landed two floors down. I thought I was safe there but she threw something and it hit me. I just kept running."
"0204"	"(2001-03-24)"	"Matthew was cleaning the woodwork in the apartment but he didn't think what he was doing was working. I told him that I thought it was and pointed out on the one he was working on that I could see where he had cleaned and where he hadn't. He was working on the upstairs bathroom. I told him he needed to step out for a minute because I needed to use it. After I closed the door I realized the toilet was about to overflow. I flushed it several times and was playing with the mechanisms in the tank trying to get it fixed. I didn't want to use the plunger but was about to tell Matthew that he needed to get the plunger and fix it. Just at that time, some people came in and I realized they had been working in that bathroom. It was apartment maintenance men. I didn't even know they had been in there and done anything. I hadn't called them to do anything. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an older toilet that was all cracked around the rim and nasty looking. Where it was cracked, there were several colors light blue and yellow and I don't remember what other colors. They had also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans built in, the kind you might see in some public bathrooms and it was a maroon color. It was also a double sink but the one sink was fairly small and rectangular in shape and the other one was round and regular size. I didn't like it at all. I questioned them as to why they were doing this when there was nothing wrong with the old fixtures. They didn't give me good answers. I didn't like the work at all. They basically just ignored me. Then a woman came in while they were here. She was from the apartment office and she said her name was Lao. I told her that as soon as these men left I would be calling her to talk to her about this. They gave me a form to sign and fill out. On several places on the form, I made it very clear that I did not like the work that they had done. That I had not requested it. That it was poor quality. One of them at one point said this isn't going to be good while he was watching me fill out the form. I just ignored him and kept writing. It wasn't the normal form that I fill out and sign when I have work done here. Then they pointed out a place for me to write some extensive comments. I wanted to get one of my own pens because the pen they gave me wasn't working well at all. I guess I thought. I don't know if I was actually talking to someone on the phone or if I was just thinking. When I called the apartment complex, I told them that I don't have a problem with John D or any of the men that normally work for him at all. They almost always do an excellent job. However, I was not pleased with this at all. As someone who has lived here almost four years, I think this is inappropriate to come in and have something like this done without my knowledge or consent. I had no problem with the previous fixtures."
"0205"	"(2001-03-25)"	"I was in a shopping mall and there was a robbery going on. Everyone in the store ducked to the floor for safety. Some of us made a run for it. We felt that the robbers were following us. We came to a place outside where we had to jump off the roof. We did. Then we found a building to duck into. It turned out to be the mall again. I was walking around an area like BR. I saw this woman go into a Bridal Store. I was afraid she saw me. She was one of the robbers. I ducked into a _____. She had seen me and came after me. All of the employees were scared and in the ground. Some of them managed to escape while I distracted her. Finally, I told her to come in the back with me because this was just between her and me. When we got to the back I started being sexual with her, hoping I could keep her distracted long enough to let the others escape and hoping I would please her enough that she would let me go."
"0206"	"(2001-04-05)"	"_________ was there. I was so excited to see her. It was something about a job, doing it well, being successful with it. I was with her at somebody's house with a bunch of other relatives."
"0207"	"(2001-04-07)"	"I was driving a car and Matthew was a little boy. He was in the front seat with me. We were driving around my mother's hometown. The weather was really bad. I was on my way to take him to school. I stopped by a little mini-mart place. I was going to buy a book of matches. There were two cigarette machines there that you could also get matches from. I was afraid to try them because I didn't want the cigarettes, only the matches. I leaned my hand against one of the machines to balance myself while I stepped over this guardrail so I could go into the store. When I did that, I found a dollar and some change, two quarters, a penny, and others. I went in the store and got in line. Just before it was my turn at the register, I saw another man come in and pick up a book of matches. He showed it to the clerk and walked out. I went ahead and grabbed a book but then it was my turn. I laid it on the counter and paid 26 cents for it. The clerk didn't get me any change. I walked out of the store and then realized I walked out with the matches. I decided that maybe I should buy a pack of cigarettes. I got out of line and then I had to get back at the end of the line because I thought I would have to get them from the cashier. Then it was my turn again. I just bought he matches, no cigarettes. I left the store and realized that I had forgotten the matches. I went back in to get them from the cashier and I saw a book lying there. I started to pick them up. He stopped me, grabbed another pack of matches, he did something to them, put them in an 8.5 x 11 sheet protector, and handed them to a cashier. She headed back to the back of the store. I followed her and asked for my matches. She said, Well we have to give you a test before you are allowed to have them. I said excuse me? I am a doctoral student. I am late for work. I have really got to go. Can I PLEASE have my matches? She just gave them to me and let me go. I got in the car and the windows were steamed up because it was cold and snowy out. Matthew had fallen asleep holding a stuffed animal. We talked a little, but I don't remember what we talked about. I was driving and the roads were really bad. It's as though I was driving on top of these big mounds of snow on the road. I thought, well, now I understand why they asked people to stay at home and they asked people to drive their own kids to school. I don't think I took him to school. I ended up at a friend's house. It was a black family. I think I dropped Matthew off there. I told them about the incident with the matches and needing to be tested to get a pack of matches. They all laughed and thought it was ridiculous too. I got ready to leave without Matthew and they asked me if there were any more Anastasia books in the series. I stepped back in the house, closed the door again, and told them I honestly didn't remember but I thought there were a bunch in the series. I suggested they check the library. I was buying the matches to light and burn my old palms. I thought about getting the cigarettes because I thought it might be easier to light the palms from a lit cigarette. I thought if I bought the cigarettes, Matthew would see me light it and I would have to say, Yes, I did try smoking once."
"0208"	"(2001-04-09)"	"Very bloody and gory. It started out that I was watching the whole event. Like a bunch of people and dignitaries going to their very formal ball, a royal ball maybe. The only person I recognize is the woman who plays CJ on West Wing. Some of the people were dressed to sneak in and kill a lot of the people in attendance. They were particularly interested in killing anyone associated with this one vicar of the Catholic Church. They specifically killed one priest that was in their way. He was killed by the _____ the priest _____ an acquaintance so it took the priest completely by surprise. There was as green tablecloth with two spots on it. One of the killers poured some wine on both spots. Then someone said, that means that you're going to kill me too. The killer said, yes, you are wise. There was a chase with that person who was to be killed as they tried to get away, but they didn't. When the killers first entered, this one woman that I recognized, her date was one of the killer but she didn't realize it until he made the signal. Then all of the killers that were with him started attacking. She was trained in self-defense because she successfully killed or surprised several of the killers and remained safe. There were two girls, late teenagers, sisters, that were running away. They were with the killers and had been asked to kill these two little girls. That was over the line for them so they were trying to run away. Their mother was not one of the killers. She kept calling to them, Come back, Come back and we'll forgive you. The one girl gave up trying to run away and stayed with the killers. The other one came back to be with her Mom and her family. Where the one woman and the one killer were getting dressed to go to the event there was something about jewelry. It was as though I had displayed this jewelry but I don't know how to explain this. The images are really disturbing to me but I can't readily describe them."
"0209"	"(2001-04-16)"	"I was in the yard of a house we were living in. I had bought a huge piece of something like Astroturf. I took it out of the plastic wrapper and unfolded it. I laid it out and on top of some trees and bushes. I wondered about cutting holes in it to get it around the trees. It didn't cover the whole front yard. The very front had a small embankment. I went and looked at the backyard to see about putting it there. I decided it would fit well there either. A friend of Matthew's said they were looking at that for their yard. I said I wasn't sure I like it anymore. I told him I was going to need three of them for the front yard alone. Darren said he wanted some time alone so he was going out for breakfast and a hike. He had a backpack on. As he walked away, I was thinking that he doesn't know how far it is to the restaurant. There were lots of Matthew's friends around. I was in the bathroom and some of them opened the door, came in, washed their hands, and then left again. They didn't knock and didn't say a word about me being in there. I realized that I should lock the door."
"0210"	"(2001-04-17)"	"I was working somewhere but I don't know where. I think it was a medical office. They put me in the back office and made me a filing clerk. The manager always made sure everyone else was placed above me. They brought a new man into work next to me but doing slightly different abilities. He kind of reminds me of Cal U. Someone came back, was talking to him and asked him what he does there. He said he is a filing clerk. My first thought was what is he doing in a job like this? Then I thought that's good that he's not letting his ego keep him from being responsible. Some vendors brought in a bunch of merchandise to sell to employees. They set up booths to display it all. They had jewelry and furniture. I went to look at the rings but by the time I got there, all of the medium size ones were gone. All that was left were very dainty ones and huge ones. One was like a neon light. It kept changing colors. Betty N was there. I started walking around to look at other things. There were very large wooden pieces of furniture. I opened this one unusual chest. I liked it but decided it wasn't quite what I was looking for. I was walking around Susan J. We looked at some kitchen furniture. I asked her if she saw anything she couldn't live without. She said no. We kept walking and saw various knick-knacks behind colored glassware. I went back to my desk and tried to call Tim W again. He worked for the same company. I had left a message a day on sales floor. I had also gone to his office to try to find him and talk to him. When I tried to call this time, I got a wrong number first. I looked in a book for a number to get the corporate directory on voice mail. When I got his number, I got through but I heard him talking to someone else. I hung up but then called back. This time I spoke with him. He said, you want out of there don't you? I said, Yes, I do. Then I said, let's see. A masters degree working as a file clerk. What's wrong with this picture? It wasn't until the other man said he was a file clerk that I would admit that's all I was too. Tim W didn't seem as pleasant to talk to as he normally might be with me."

"0212"	"(2001-04-18)"	"I was sleeping in someone's house. The man of the house kept telling me to let him know if I get cold. I finally told him that my nose and toes were cold. He felt my toes and then turned up the heat."
"0213"	"(2001-04-21)"	"I went to the YMCA with a bunch of women from church. I don't think they were my CRHP sisters. In fact, I didn't know anyone. One person was there as our trainer to get us started on a program. Some of the women were having more difficulty than I was. I was trying to be encouraging and supportive to them. I told one in particular that I wasn't trying to be pushy, that I was only trying to be her cheerleader. She and one or two of the others were wearing dresses to work out. They were kind of out-of-style. Straight, cotton, pastels with collars, belted waist and button down the front. As one of them was working out, I saw the trainer behind her kind of spotting the weights. Although there was no need to because it was a weight machine. One of the weights did kind of stick or something at first as they sometimes do. I was waiting my turn sitting on another machine. While I was waiting, I could see into another part of the gym. Through glass windows, I noticed my name on one of the machines. At first, I thought it said, or meant, that I passed on it the last time, meaning I didn't use it. I then realized that it said something was completed. I realized that it had been a long time since I had been there so I figured not many people use that machine if my name was still on it. When we were done, I went to get my puppy out of this one room before going home. Someone there had been watching him for me. He was actually there for another reason but had agreed to watch him for me while I worked out. There were puppies running around all over the place. There was a woman sitting on the ground with her kids. I think they were having a picnic. Their puppy was running around also. The name of their puppy was Monica. They said they chose that name because it's an unusual name for a puppy. I said I had named my puppy that for the same reason but it was also the name of its mother. I was kneeling on the floor and these puppies were running all around me. There were two bulldogs that were really bothering me. I thought they were going to bite me. One was brown with green spots. I kept pushing them away and I wanted to get up but it was as though I was paralyzed there. I did finally get up but I don't know how. I still couldn't seem to get away from the puppies. I was talking to Matthew about paying him $5 and how to get it to him .I told him I would mail it to him but he said his wife could come pick it up. I asked him how much longer he would be there and he said at least another hour. My puppy was playing behind the closed door so I told Matthew I would leave the puppy with him while I went to my locker to get my things and then I could pay him. When I went to the locker room, I accidentally went into the men's locker room. I saw the men in the hot tub and realized what I had done. I left and again, mistakenly, went into the other men's locker room. When I finally went into the women's, there were three different sections. I realized that I didn't remember which locker I had used or the number on it. I started trying my key in all the locks. I was afraid someone would see me. My key opened some of the locks but they weren't mine. Sometimes I had trouble getting the things back inside to close it. Many of the lockers were very small, maybe 18 inches by 6 inches. Some of them I left unlocked because I could get the things back in. There were some very unusual locks too that I had to do certain things in order to relock them. I was getting very upset that I didn't remember and that I couldn't find it. I was worried what people would think. I also worried that may be I had mistakenly used one of the men's lockers. One aisle of the women's lockers was very narrow. I started checking these but then realized I would not have used them because of the narrow aisle. I finally gave up, went, and told Matthew what happened. I was very upset because I said my keys were in there too. I then realized I had the car key hidden on the car. Then I could get home and the apartment office could let me in the house. I also then realized that I usually have my purse under the front seat of the car when I go into the YMCA so maybe I had done that this time."
"0214"	"(2001-04-22)"	"I got in a small canoe and rode down a canal in a city. This time, just before I got to the waterfall-like place I stopped myself. I went to the canal three times. The second time I got in the canoe. The first time I saw a canoe with a cake in it that was shaped like a large cruise ship but it was the size of a normal cake. The second time I saw the owner of the cake and spoke with her. She began to destroy the cake so I began taking parts and eating. The second time I was passing boats of other people. The last two I passed the people were all asleep. Just as I stepped myself, I realized I should have wakened them to warn them they were approaching the fall. They woke up and started screaming. I had gone under several overpasses before I reached this point. The third time I was sitting in snow along the canal. I called BJ on the phone. They were excited thinking I had called to tell them I had a job. I can't remember now why I called but it wasn't that."
"0215"	"(2001-04-23)"	"It was like watching a beautiful movie unfold and yet I was the main character. The somatic feelings were such that I didn't want to awaken. I didn't want to ever leave my bed. I felt warm and tingly all over. I felt so much love that I thought my heart would burst. I felt peace and safety like none I have ever felt before. I was living in another time and another culture. Yet I cannot identify either. It was a time of honor and simplicity, yet the home I lived in was very comfortable by today's standards. It almost had a feeling and look of what I imagine to be old Mexico or Spain, yet my family and I were Caucasian. I wish more than ever that I were an artist so I could sit immediately at my easel and paint the images in my mind so as to never lose them. It was nearly a year before I was to be married. The parents of both my betrothed and myself were very involved in the commitment. [Through most of the dream] I did not spend time with my betrothed. I saw him only on occasion with his father, as they came to check on me. They wanted to be sure that nothing would interfere with the marriage. My father had hired a bodyguard for me. His name was Victor. One day Victor and I were sitting at the kitchen table, each at a different side of the table, yet sitting next to each other. We were discussing life and some of the disparities in our two lives. I felt his pain as he shared with me how unaccepted he is in so many areas because of his heritage. I believe he was of Spanish decent. Victor was a tall man with bronze-colored skin. His hair was jet black and smooth as silk. His chiseled features and dark eyes were always noticed when he entered a room. I don't know if it was his appearance that got him noticed or the feel of his presence. He told me that he must be careful guarding me, as he must guard himself too. People living in my area would be happy to kill him rather than watch him roam our streets, even acting as my bodyguard. I felt so much pain and sorrow at this. Yet, he would not give up his position as my bodyguard. I rose from my chair and hugged him, cradling his head to my chest and caressing his hair. I kissed him lightly on the head. He looked up at me and I kissed him lightly on the lips. I quickly apologized. From the look in his eyes, I could not tell what he was thinking. He told me not to apologize. A few months later, I was at my bridal shower. All of my girlfriends and women relatives were there. My father was also there. I had such a warm and loving relationship with my father. I was sitting on an ottoman in front of him, with my arms stretched behind me embracing his gray and balding head as he leaned forward to cradle me in his arms and rest his chin on my shoulder. The women were playing a game. Each had a card made of colored construction paper and folded in half. The inside of each card was white with colored markings on it. Each one represented a man I had dated. One woman would read characteristics and then each of the other would mark their card if that man had those characteristics. The characteristics they read were both good and bad. I quickly made an additional card representing my father. I said I wanted to see how many of them compared to my father. Victor came and sat at the edge of the room in a rocking chair. His quiet, calm, strong presence permeated the air in the room. As always, this left me feeling unsettled, as I felt it deep in my soul. I secretly wanted to make a card for Victor. Later that evening there was a party for all of our family and friends, male and female. We were laughing and dancing. I asked Victor to dance with me. Just as I asked, the music changed to a ballad. Victor quickly agreed to dance with me. I felt the butterflies in my stomach as Victor took my hand and wrapped his arm gently around my waist, pulling me close, but not too. Our dancing in rhythm was effortless, as though we had been life-long dance partners. I could feel that we both wanted nothing more than to be closer and to gaze into each other's eyes. We dared not say anything for fear the other would say they did not feel the same thing. We dared not, for fear others would notice. I finally gave in ever so slightly, when I rested my head on his chest as we continued to dance. Weeks later, my family and friends were outdoors playing in the swimming pool. They had placed a cover over the pool so you could walk and run on it with only a few inches of water on top. They also had something spraying water into the air and people were running about in the spraying water and atop the pool. Even my father was joining in the fun. I was standing near the back by a stone wall, under a tree, with Victor. He was so enjoying watching the fun, envious because he had never experienced a family such as this. I was trying to encourage him to join us. For the first time, in the shadows of the tree, he made his feelings for me known. He ever so gently touched my breast, as if by accident, but I knew it was not an accident. I asked him if he did not want to be with me as much as I wanted to be with him. I could see the affirmation in his eyes. Yet, I was betrothed to another and Victor was employed by my father to be my bodyguard. He dared not say the words. A short time later, my betrothed and his father and two other men drove into the courtyard. They were in a car that reminded me of something a mobster would drive. They exchanged words with my father, warning that nothing should interfere with the wedding, which was scheduled for the next day. I was standing at a laptop computer, sitting on a pedestal. I was playing some kind of games that tested your mind. A woman, related to my betrothed came up and started poking fun and trying to make me miss the answers. I realized at that point that I could not go through with this marriage. I walked up an iron, circular staircase with another woman. I don't know if it was a sister or a friend. The staircase led to a veranda. My mother was already there, laying on an upholstered chaise lounge. She immediately called for my father to join us. When my father arrived, he said he was going to call off the wedding because he had just learned that my betrothed had been unfaithful to me. I was overjoyed. I sat by my mother on the chaise lounge. She had covered herself with a beautiful red silk shawl. As I gently leaned on my mother's side, I cautiously told them of my feelings for Victor and that I believed he felt the same, but was unwilling to say so because of his position. My father was overjoyed at the prospect of a union between Victor and myself. I say my mother's support and approval in her eyes. He called for Victor. After a brief conversation, he asked Victor if he would like to take my hand in marriage. Before Victor had a chance to respond, he said that it would bring him great joy to witness such a union. Victor said, he too, would be honored and overjoyed. My father said the wedding would go ahead as planned, with one exception. The groom would be Victor. Once alone with Victor we were able to finally express our feelings for each other, and our joy at our upcoming marriage. We recognized the beauty of our first night together being on our wedding night."
"0216"	"(2001-04-24)"	"I was in an office building at KATC, in a classroom. I was sitting in one of the seats listening to someone talk. I was making notes about dreams. This man and I were the only people in the room. I thought this was going to be a good room for me to use to teach. The man closed a window and I thought, that it will be nice that I can open the windows for the students for whatever reason. I was outside the building now with several people. Three of them were the final two survivors and the man who comes on for challenges and tribal meetings. One of the final survivors was Andy Williams. The other one was Colby. Someone said something about what if something happened to the host. Then one of the final two would have to fill that role as well. We were talking to Andy because Colby was asleep. We were simultaneously on the island and in the parking lot at the same time. Andy decided he would win by cutting Colby's hand off while he was sleeping. I didn't think he was serious until I saw him put this huge knife to Colby's wrist. I started screaming and saying, oh my God. He did it. Oh my God. He did it. I started to run but didn't know where to run. I saw alligator's in the water. I was covering my ears and partially covering my eyes. I just wanted to get away from this."
"0217"	"(2001-04-27)"	"I was with family and I realized I had missed all of my 4.28.01 appointments. I looked in my appointment book to see who I would have to call and how many would need to be rescheduled. I was at a meeting. It was a large room, like a conference room, with many tables. I gathered my things along with a cup of water and tried to find a seat near the middle of the room. The speaker kept moving around and I thought I would be able to hear better there. The people didn't want me there and made that very clear. I picked up my cup of ice water and papers and moved again."
"0218"	"(2001-04-29)"	"I was sitting in the back of church during Mass. I was falling asleep. There was a man standing in the aisle next to me. I think to keep me awake. There was a woman saying Mass. She had shoulder-length, black hair, parted down the middle. I get up to go to Communion. The people in the rows in front of me weren't getting up. Just as I got in line they got in front of me. The lines were all messed up like people not knowing where the lines were so I kept finding myself out of line. When I finally made it to the front, I was now a male priest rather than a female."
"0219"	"(2001-05-01)"	"I called Mother a day late to wish her a happy birthday. Then I forgot to say anything when I called. I realized I would have to call her back."
"0220"	"(2001-05-03)"	"I was at home in bed. I heard someone come in the house and come upstairs. He got into my bed with me. I was frozen. I couldn't move. He spoke to me but I don't remember what he said. I had my back to him and I tried to roll over but couldn't move. Somehow, I finally was face to face with him. He was leaning over me. I reached up and poked his throat really hard with my finger. I kept applying the pressure trying to render him helpless. I knew I might kill him but it would be in self-defense. I had no other way to fight him off. I was outside getting into a car with him and two other men."
"0221"	"(2001-05-03)"	"I was at this beautiful very large house. We were outside. The dad was there and I think five children. One child was going up the sidewalk to go in the house. Daddy told him to pick something up and take it with him. He ignored him at first then went back and got it. There was another child playing with some balls in the yard. He threw two of them and they rolled down the hill and pretty far away so he had to go after them. The others were laughing about and I told them they could go help him but hey didn't. One of the balls was a basketball. When I was inside the house, I was badly sunburned. I especially remember how badly my feet were burnt. But also my chest. Bob F said something to me about it. I was going to take a shower and Matthew said he had to be ready to go in a little more than an hour. I let him shower first but I said something to him about how he always does that, tries to squeeze in the shower right when I am ready to do so. I was little miffed at him over it. There were these people there talking about how I dressed and how I should dress more attractively. This one couple came up and were dressed in these very elaborate colorful clothing. They were obviously in love, playing and having fun with each other. I went to my room and pulled out a short satin robe to put on. I wondered if I should put something on under it while waiting for the shower. Or if I should just wear it as is."
"0222"	"(2001-05-03)"	"I was at a fair with Lilly H and Tonya H. We stopped at this food vendor to get something to eat. I was third inline behind them. It was all desserts and fruit. I had decided I was going to have some of the peach cobbler and a few prunes. I wasn't sure if it was peach cobbler but I knew that was what I wanted. When it was my turn, they took that away and left only vegetables and prunes. I said I wanted some of that meaning the cobbler but she ended up giving me a plate of something that looked like huge green beans. At first she started putting them on a very small plate but then she put them on a larger plate. She put the prunes on their plates too. When I went to sit down with Lilly H and Tonya H, I saw they were with a bunch of family members. I thought they should have told me if they were coming with family and I wouldn't have come along. I went back and tried to find my purse and couldn't. I finally found someone who was working there and asked her. She told me she had hidden it to keep it safe for me. I was so grateful. I pulled out my wallet and was going to give her $5 for doing that."
"0223"	"(2001-05-03)"	"I was at Bev's house and she wasn't there at first. I was there playing with Rachel S and Bob F was there and Mari Kate S. I got into the dishwasher for some reason. There were old cans and the cut off lids and stuff like that in the dishwasher. I almost cut myself on a lid. I thought that was very dangerous and they shouldn't be in there. But I didn't know why they were so I left them. I jar was in there with the lid on and was full of water like they were soaking it to clean it out. I asked Bob F if he had gotten the grad announcement, he said he had. I asked if he liked the invitation and he said he did but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I thought people would. He said the invitation said the party was at my house. I worried about this to because I thought I had everything right before I sent them out. I asked Mari Kate S if they had theirs yet. She went and got it out of the mailbox and I was getting ready to look at it and double check. Bev was sitting there and had not seen it."
"0224"	"(2001-05-04)"	"We were at a Harris Family reunion. Bruce W was there. I think with his wife. He had a lot of small animals in cages, about the size of Sir Gallahad. They were very unusual. There was a cow and a pig. There were quite a few puppies. One was a bear. They were miniatures. They were all very tame, gentle, and easy to play with. One of the puppies was fighting me a bit so I sat him down or he wiggled out of my hands. Bruce W corralled him back into his care right away."
"0225"	"(2001-05-04)"	"Grandma F had just died. We were in the house taking down pictures and things off the wall because some people wanted to take things of hers home with them right away. We knew that we needed to put most of the things together and save it until we came back to formally divide up all of there things. I was walking around looking for a picture. Then we decided we would go in a room where we took everything down and put it in one room, that we would just go in there and took turns selecting one thing. I was upset because the two pictures I wanted most, BJ had taken already. I ended up taking a picture of a farm with a barn and cow on it. I thought it was kind of cool and reminded me of her. It was one of the ones I remember most looking at when I was back there. While we were dividing these things up, some other people kept brining some other stuff in this room. We had to keep asking them to carry it back because it was stuff we were saving until we had our formal division of property."
"0226"	"(2001-05-04)"	"It seems we started out someplace where there was a lot of snow. There was a big crevice in the snow like a crack from an earthquake. I wanted to get down in the crevice and have someone take a picture for my audition video, but I couldn't fit in. Someone thinner than me did fit in. I noticed that the crevice started closing up. Someone and I kept pushing against one side of it to try to move it and keep it open. We were trying to rock it, the way you would a car stuck in mud. There was water on the other side of the crevice. As we rocked it the water started splashing over and all of a sudden we wanted to turn and run away before the water got us. When we turned around, we realized we had to swim to get back to land. We did. I was in someone's home and had emptied a 2-liter soda bottle. I took it to the woman of the house and asked her where the trashcan is so I could throw it away. She didn't understand me because she did not speak English. Someone else came up, interpreted for me, and told me where to take the bottle, which I did. One member of the tem came out with a squirt gun filled with hot sauce. She was squirting everyone. None of us liked that because we wearing the only clothing we were able to take with us and now it had hot sauce on it. We went and washed it off as best we could. I went to use the bathroom twice. The bathrooms were very unusual. I thought I better get used to it because soon I would only have the great outdoors to use. Oddly, I thought that would be better than this. We were in a restaurant. I was sitting a table with four other women. I was sitting in the middle of two of them. Two sitting across from e. The waiter came and took orders from three of them but didn't ask the other two of us if we wanted anything. The woman sitting next to me asked if they had anything decaf. He said, No! So she said she didn't want anything. At that point, I said I didn't either if they didn't have anything decaf. Later there were several of us standing around talking. One of the women looked like she was six or seven months pregnant. She was saying when her delivery could happen, that it might happen while we are out. I said, we might be delivering a baby there. She started saying something and pushing on her stomach and pulled out a huge sweater. She had just been playing around, teasing us. Myself and one other woman were walking around a wooded area. There was no snow on the ground. We were looking at pieces of bark lying on the ground. We were talking about how that would work really well to build a shelter. I was walking along what seemed to be a beach. I reached down and ran my hand through the sand because it was so pretty. I realized that it was more like gravel. It was very smooth and felt good to the touch. I was running along and running my fingers through this gravel. As I progressed, the gravel got larger and larger to where it was just these very smooth stones. All of us got into three cars. Two cars had four people each and one car had five people."

"0228"	"(2001-05-09)"	"I had a dream about doing the Maori exercise with my CRHP sisters. I don't know where we were. We were in a large room and we were sitting at a table formed in a circle. Rosalie C was there and so was Scott S from church. He was baking things like popcorn and muffins for us. I have no idea why he was there. He and Rosalie C said we were all getting these coupons for a store at the mall. We could use them to get things free- over and over. Popcorn and muffins. So we. I explained about the Maori drawing. Then started drawing with the lights very dim. I let them go too long. When we got done, I suggested we take a ten-minute break because the next part would take ten to fifteen minutes per person. When we got back together from the break, I noticed how elaborate some of the drawings were. I had forgotten to tell them to draw a circle first, yet many of them had done that and drawn the symbols in the circle. I started to give them the rest of the instructions, but they wanted us all to hold hands and walk in a circle while I was doing this. I stayed outside the circle while they did it. I told them I needed to stand still while I was reading it. When I got ready to pull my own drawing out, I told them they could share as much or as little as they like. I said I would show them mine from a distance and point out some things. God, toys, children, family. When I spoke of specific things in mine, there was a basketball game on it. I said it was there because of the large audience that I felt represented ministering to the public. Karen E made a joke about the game, I think asking me who was playing, and I said I didn't know. Then I realized it was Naphoo vs. Yahoo playing at the Plantation Bowl. Cliff S was also in the room but was sitting on the floor along a sidewall."

"0230"	"(2001-05-18)"	"I went to work for a woman business owner. The job was something about presenting programs to groups. I was talking to one of her employees about ADHD and how it affects your life. We thought it would be a great idea to market a program about ADD, educating people about signs and symptoms, treatment, living with ADD, how people with ADD are treated by others. The owner of the business liked the idea. She said the other employee could do all the clerical work and I could just do the presenting. I told her I thought it would be a full-time job so why not build enough into the cost of the program to pay me as a full-time employee and let me handle most of that: registration calls, set arrangements, etc. I think she agreed. I told her I had a voice mail only number that we could use and that I would put together a business plan. She didn't seem to see a need for a business plan. Her other employee wanted to try my meds for ADD. They both wanted to get something to drink first. Then I gave her one _ pill, telling her that's all she should take. I broke one in half with my fingernail. They said something about me using my fingernail. I commented how tough my nails are. The employee said something about using Sally Hansen products on her nails. I turned around and said I do too. Then I saw she had Sally Hansen products lined along her desk. I said, I use, then went to the desk to try to find the one I use and picking it up as I finished the sentence, saying NuNail. I then realized how short my nails were at that time so I explained that I often have to cut them down because they get too long or if I break two or more off below the quick I cut them all down so they look even."
"0231"	"(2001-05-19)"	"I was downloading software and trying to send an IM to Daddy. Maybe I sent it to Mother and he answered. He was going to tell me how to finish downloading my software. It turned out not to be a problem but I realized I didn't get back to him after that, so I sent another IM. This one I sent to Mother. I'm at Mother and Daddy's at the old house. She is sitting in the kitchen at her computer and I walked by and the computer screen is facing me and I comment about how dirty her computer screen is and that it needs to be cleaned. I wiped it with my fingers but then I went and got some paper towels and Windex and cleaned it for her. I don't know if I said this or if I just thought it. I think I said it. This is one thing I will definitely clean when I see it needs to be cleaned. Then I'm back at my computer at home and realized I hadn't continued my IM conversation with Mother. I type in something about being sorry because I had to leave to go get some milk. I'm back now. I'm in my car, again, and headed home. There's a computer keyboard and monitor in front of me where the steering wheel is. I'm driving and having a really hard time seeing the road. I thought to myself, how do I normally see around or over this thing? I can't see the road so I'm trying to look around it. I'm raising myself off the seat so I can look around the monitor and see the road. I think, maybe if I raise the seat higher. I don't usually. So what's different? There's a car pulling a huge trailer across a one-lane wood bridge. I don't see it in time. I drive off the road and around the bridge and back onto the road. The road then turns into an unusual looking railroad track. Then I think, oh, great now I'm driving on a railroad track. I'm driving on a railroad track and up a mountain. I'm thinking, this is so weird and the worst part is that it is not a dream because I know I'm not dreaming. I keep going and then I can see the vehicle that I'm driving going up the mountain but it has like four other vehicles or trailers attached to it that it is pulling. It runs into the train and starts pushing the train up the mountain. I'm talking to this man, I'm complaining about the whole incident with the train and the bridge. I have this toy-size car and trailers that I was driving. I show him what happened driving up the mountain. I tell him it was entirely his fault because I had called his company to come to the house/farm and do something and he didn't do it. I'm demonstrating backing all this down the mountain and back to my property. Football players and one of the players crossed the end zone. As he got there, he jumped in the air, turned around, and caught the football. I think it was me. As I was having it, I was thinking, oh, I'm not awake yet, I need to make sure I record it. But I'm so sleepy I don't want to reach for the recorder to record it."
"0232"	"(2001-05-19)"	"Someone holding a baby in front of a person wearing glasses and the baby reaches kind of pokes at the glasses. I was Aunt P and Aunt H's house and I was watering their garden and flowerbeds. I had told them each that I was going to do that and to do it I was just going to let the hose run at a trickle and just let it soak them because they needed it so badly. I also had a fan out in the yard blowing on the yard or the garden where I was watering also. I was training to become some kind of a pilot. Anthony Edwards was my instructor and I only had about five lessons. The last one is the one I remember most. In that one, we were going to learn how to get height and how to go back down by pulling the handle bar or steering wheels toward you to go up and away from you to go down. Before my lesson, I got in a simulator and practiced. At first, I was terrible. I would go up really fast and down really fast. It was really awful. I practiced enough to get the nuance that by the time it was time for my lesson I did really well. After that, I found out that I passed, that I was now a certified pilot, and that I was one of the best in my class. I was talking to some of my classmates and their families about this because the husbands and children were there too."
"0233"	"(2001-05-21)"	"I was at a conference similar to the old DDSI Conventions. I was a supplier. Marcia N was there and she told me that Carol [unknown in waking life] from CFC was there and had been given a new job as a Sales Executive. Shortly after that, Marcia N asked me about ordering flower arrangements. We had ordered two the year before so I ordered two again. Craig B came to say good-bye and I made some light jokes about him leaving today and it being our first day there, and some different little things."
"0234"	"(2001-05-21)"	"I was leaving this shopping center to go home and noticed that someone had built this very tall and very, very long blue fence. There was a subdivision on the other side but I didn't know how to get around the fence to get home as the fence seemed to be a mile or more long. I didn't see the end of the fence. Maybe that's why I though I couldn't get around it. I decided to just fly over the fence to get home. Even after I flew over the fence, I couldn't find my house. I was in this neighborhood and I was driving along these sidewalks between the houses-kind of like the sidewalks behind the apartments here. People and children were running to get out of my way. I didn't seem to think I was going to hit anyone."
"0235"	"(2001-05-23)"	"I was at a kind of indoor flea market. It reminded me of the antique mall across the street but it didn't seem to be antiques, or at least not all antiques. When I first walked in there were these children dressed up in toy-like costumes. They were standing perfectly still until I entered the room and then they started running around. One of them came up and hugged me. One of them, a girl, had her head bent down and was brushing her head up away from her neck. She had said she wasn't hot but I noticed a red rash on her neck and asked again as it reminded me of heat rash. Then she said yes, she was hot. One of the things that I saw in the market was a jewelry armoire filled with LRJ and books. At first, I didn't know what it was until I saw the books. As I picked up a book, a man working there said he was just now reading the book but if I had questions, he would help me. I looked to see if they had any of the items that I now own that are damaged or pieces missing, like one earring missing. They didn't. I didn't recognize any of the pieces they had. I closed the armoire and moved on. I went into a room and saw all of the chains of big colored, plastic beads lying all over the floor. Someone told us what they were, but I don't remember now what they called them. Another woman shopping there thought they were great. She started looking at them to purchase some of them. Someone took some of them apart and there were beads rolling around all over the floor. Someone picked up something else to show us how easy these beads were to pick up. She stuck this thing in the beads, it picked up several at once, and then she put them in a bucket of sorts. I tried it, as did a few other people. It was interesting how it worked. I decided to leave. I finally found an exit but it led into a maze. I hesitated momentarily because I really don't like mazes. They make me claustrophobic and I'm afraid I can't get out. I went ahead. It was all wood, top, bottom, and sides. There was a tape playing while you went through it. It was a male voice of an advertisement for the flea market/store. At one point in the maze, you had to lie down to continue going through and something kind of sucked/pushed you through. I really didn't want to do that but didn't think I had a choice and it was very short so I went ahead. At the end of the maze, there was another place like this. I went ahead since the first one was no big deal. However, this one turned out to be very long. I started getting panicky and trying to figure out a way out. It finally let me out on the outside of the market. It was the end of the maze."
"0236"	"(2001-05-23)"	"I was in this house that wasn't mine. A man was there talking to his wife. His wife was in the shower. The man was tall, medium build, dark hair and tanned skin. As he and I were talking, I began to kiss him on the neck. He kept talking but I could tell he was enjoying it and perhaps flustered by what I was doing not knowing what to do or say. I stopped for a moment and he turned to look at me. He still didn't say anything about what I was doing. He turned away again and began talking about something else. Then I began kissing his chin. He turned and kissed me on the lips briefly."
"0237"	"(2001-05-23)"	"I went to ELC and told them if they were really in a crunch about that training coordinator job that I could still take it. I tried to assure them that I could do a good job. They misunderstood and they thought I was coming to them because I wanted to work directly for them as opposed to working for Kathy U. They were going to pay Kathy U $65 an hour for this job and Kathy U was only going to pay me $20 an hour. She wanted to talk to me, but asked me to wait. While I was waiting, I took an elevator downstairs. Lilly H and Tony U were there from SVH. There was also this map on this ceiling. The woman I would be working for and some other people needed to take all the pins out and stuff. I got up on this chair and was helping them dismantle this map. Some had flag heads, some blue balls, and some regular straight pins. I had a clear plastic box that I was putting them in but I kept dropping and losing some of them. I would put them in my hand until I could put them in the box and then I would drop them. I finally took the box from someone else so I could just drop them directly into the box."
"0238"	"(2001-05-25)"	"I just had an incredible dream and I'm not even sure I can begin to describe it except that I was part of a team working on a special project for the government. We enter our vehicle and our learning facility for several months. The place I selected for us to go was very well ___ to us. We were able to go under the water without worrying about our breathing. We came back I was going to church. TH with family. I was sitting outside and there were a lot of table and chairs sitting outside in the grass. People were sitting there eating. I had a McDonald's meal and was going to sit down and eat it before going in to Mass. I was having trouble finding a place to sit. I finally ended up sitting on a cement wall. While I was eating, the church choir came out and started practicing. They were in three sections, but they played instruments also. One section was playing violin and singing and I thought that was unusual. Everybody went in for Mass. I went in, went to one section, and saw that there were a lot of seats. It was a side section of the church. It was kind of behind a wall so you couldn't see very well. I went to check another section first. Then I saw my whole family sitting there and they waved for me to come up and sit with them. I did, but it was really, really tight. There were some people in the bench that weren't part of our family and they were kind of upset and were squeezing us tighter. I finally got up and went back to that other section."
"0239"	"(2001-05-26)"	"Survivor dream. We were wading through water. It came up to my armpits. It had like a white foamy something on the surface. You could also see animals walking through the animals. You could just see their horns and ears sticking out of the water. We were holding hands and wading through the water. I wasn't afraid at all. I think we were in Africa. We were outdoors. Suddenly there were snakes everywhere. At first, I wasn't afraid, but I was avoiding them. Someone was shooting at them and killing them. I suddenly realized that I had this huge snake on my back but it looked more like an octopus. Then I got scared and started jerking. I think I was trying to either shake it off or just got scared and had an involuntary muscle reaction. The person that was shooting kept telling me to turn a little bit so he could get a clear shot at the snake. I was too scared to move yet I kept jerking. We were still outdoors and close to my home. Everyone on my tribe was supposed to be displaying all of our accomplishments in our life so far, certifications, awards, and things like that. Somebody had displayed their professional accomplishments where the others were related to survivor. I asked someone about it and they said it wasn't necessary. I said, well, maybe not. However, if they are going to display theirs then I want to display mine as well or else it looks like I don't have any. They agreed that was fine. I went home, took all my plaques off the wall, and was putting them in canvass bags to carry them. There were two huge binders full of something that I moved. I was going through the binders looking for a group photo of SAID members with Barry C. He had signed an 8 x 10. I was looking for it, because Patricia S had displayed hers. I thought if she has hers out there then I went mine out there. I really didn't see this as an accomplishment though. I brought them back and was getting ready to display them on the tables where my other tribe members had displayed theirs. They had everything scattered. I was trying to make room for mine, while keeping their things all together. This one man's accomplishments were all of these creatures, like insects and reptiles that he had in plastic cases. I started to move them and I realized they were alive. One of them was a snake all coiled up. It made me jump. Another member, all she had were pieces of paper with things written on them. I don't know what language, maybe Chinese. She had three groups of them. They were little scraps of paper that she had written on. She put them in three groups and made labels for each group. She had laid these in the shape of a rainbow. I went to move them and I got them all pushed together. I was trying to separate them and make sure they were still in the right groups, where they were supposed to be."
"0240"	"(2001-05-28)"	"I was doing a dream group for family. Aunt H, Aunt P, Aunt J, cousins, women from St. Joe, Aunt A, and some of my own family. I was at Mother and Daddy's house. I went up to school to get a few things and finish putting my materials together and stuff. I then went to the church and realized that I must be late because there were so many cars in the parking lot. I looked at my watch and it said 3:77. I knew I must be 20 minutes late maybe. Someone met me outside and took me into a side door of the church but it ended up being this big meeting room. Paulette W and her son were there also. He was playing video games and stuff right behind me. She said she hoped it wouldn't be a problem. Of course, I couldn't say anything. I handed out the folders. There was a TV playing and I realized I kept getting distracted by the TV. I was supposed to be conducting this group and I kept finding myself doing nothing more than standing there watching this TV. I suggested we turn the TV off and yet later I realized the same thing was happening again. I don't know how the TV got turned back on. I was feeling disorganized and my thoughts were very fragmented. It wasn't going well at all. I was back outside and going back inside. This time the church looked different. Big white church with very steep or deep white cement steps. I started to walk in but my eye was really bothering me. I couldn't see out of it. I was becoming less stable on my feet. Alan K walked up and opened the door for me. I walked in and had my hand over my bad eye. I was walking slowly and stepping carefully. I couldn't use one of the steps because it was too wobbly and I couldn't see well enough. He took my arm and helped me find my way to the bottom of these steps and to a step. Then I told everyone what was going on with my eye and I felt like I was getting a cold and I was just feeling that it wasn't going well at all and I really didn't like that. Having said all that, I hope you don't mind but I'm going to go ahead and put this on. It was a beige and navy blue baseball cap. It had something written on it but I don't know what. At first, it fell down over my eyes. I pushed it up some and tucked it behind my ears so it would stay. I couldn't tighten it. I resumed talking. I was talking about different kinds of window shades not about dreams. We were in Aunt P and Aunt H's house. Not their waking life house. It was very large and beautiful. They had in one area where I was standing to give the talk I could see five different windows. I was talking about how they had used different treatments and different fabrics on each window, I commented on how well coordinated it was and how good that combination went together. Then I reached in my box of stuff and pulled out some very small, maybe one inch in diameter fabric samples for vertical blinds. I asked if they had vertical blinds but just as I asked I saw that they did. They were kind of like a lacy flower pattern. Very pretty and I commented on the same. I asked them if she had help with the decorating or if she had done it all themselves. They said they had some help. Then we continued talking. Kendall B walked up to join the group and he took a seat. I introduced him, looked at him, said should I tell them now or later who you are. He just grinned and didn't say anything so I decided to wait until later. I was still feeling really uncomfortable, as though it wasn't going well. The TV was back on again and I was trying to get them to turn it off and leave it off. I whispered to Kendall B that I had some great things to show him about my research. He just grinned again and walked away to find a place to sit and observe my group. I was still feeling that it wasn't going well at all. I wasn't prepared. I was very ill at ease. I said I like to leave lots of time for questions because people have lots of questions. I started taking questions at that point. We were having some great discussion. We got off track from time to time talking about dreams. I realized from some of the questions that I was pretty well prepared so I felt less nervous about Kendall B hearing my answers to these questions."
"0241"	"(2001-05-30)"	"I was at a hotel with family and friends but I'm not sure why. It might have had something to do with graduation. We were chatting with some people about Matthew graduating. He walked up and we were chatting a little bit. He knocked on somebody's room door and one of his friend's came out and his friend was trying to teach me to do this thing with my hands. Then they took off and Matthew came back and had picked up some mail for us at the front desk. It was a bunch of letters, a fed ex package, and a big box. None of them were for us. It wasn't the address of the hotel and it wasn't our name. I took them back down to the front desk to let them know that they were in our mailbox. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I told them the other box was still upstairs because it was sports equipment and it was too heavy for me to bring down. When I went back upstairs, it was sitting with some other things for them to take downstairs. As I was walking through the hotel, someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind. I turned around. It was two women and a man. The woman in the middle was tall, with glasses, blonde hair, and older. She reached down, hugged me, and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I didn't know who she was but I acted as though I did. I said, hi how are you? We chatted a little bit. Then the three of them went into the restrooms. I realized that they were from DDSI. I walked a little ways trying to find the DDSI meeting. I figured there must be a meeting there. I found it and I went in. There was a table at the front that Vince P, Joanne N, and probably the area coordinators were sitting there. I went up and just crouched down on the floor at the end of the table. Diane S was sitting at the end of the table. She said, since she had the baby she was just doing DDSI full time. She wasn't giving the small jobs to a decorator anymore. We talked about her husband a little bit. She had been sitting next to Vince P. I put my hand on his shoulder and pulled him towards me. I said you haven't been returning my phone calls. He said, yes, I know. I said what's going on with that. He said things are different now. I said what does that mean. He said the last message you left you were kind of coming on to me. I said, no I wasn't. He said, well things are different now. He wouldn't even talk to me any more than that. I finally decided that I was going to leave. I leaned over to Joanne N and asked her if there was anything she needed from WDF right now. She said not that she was aware of. I said, Okay. I can't stay because I'm not feeling well. However, I wanted to check in. Then one of the other coordinators stopped me before I left and opened a sample book to a fabric and asked me to find out if we have it in orchid and then she closed the book right away. I reached for a pad of paper and a pen. I had this little bitty pen, the size of my fingertip. I needed her to open the book back up so I could write down the fabric. I wrote down the page. As I was doing this, I realized that this was silly. Of course, it doesn't come in orchid. If it did, it would be in the sample book. I didn't say anything because I had already made her think I didn't know that already and that I was going to check on it. I wrote down the name of the sample book. I said that is just really beautiful fabric. It was shiny, satiny soft. Really nice fabric. She said, yes it is. Then two other people had some things for me so I wrote them down. Then I left and I realized I was barefoot. I don't know why. When I left, I was in a hall surrounded by doors. There was no way out except to go through one of these doors. I couldn't find the door that I just came through. I was looking in some of the doors and there were other meetings. I was trying to find my way out. I finally did, but I don't know how. As I was walking away, I ran into Tim W. He was saying something to me about still representing WDF. He said we have their business now, so we don't really need you. If I were you, I wouldn't do it. You aren't getting paid for it, and we have their business. He called me boy, or son, or something equally ridiculous. He shrugged his shoulders and walked away. At that point, I thought about not even turning in the notes I had. That wouldn't look good for me or for them. I also thought about what would happen down the road if I didn't do that. As I was walking through the hotel, there were many young women in beautiful white dresses. They were all alone. I wondered if there was a debutante ball going on. Then I saw a stage area where a lot of them were gathered. There were five of them performing but they were in pink dresses. I thought that's not a debutante ball, because they don't wear pink dresses."
"0242"	"(2001-05-31)"	"Jennifer K came over. We were at mother and daddy's house. She came over to visit. She was telling me that her mother wanted to buy Matthew this huge toy for out in the yard. Toy for lack of a better thing to call it. I don't remember what she called it. It was going to be 24 x 12 feet, all plastic, enclosed, netting for safety. The kids could go in and jump in it and stuff. When mother was thinking about it, Jennifer K was in this tent thing that was zipped up and hanging from something in the house. I could tell mother wasn't pleased. I unzipped the thing that Jennifer K was in and she poked her head out. We talked about it a little bit more. I don't think Mother ever answered us. I don't remember Jennifer K leaving or anything. After she was gone, I was helping mother do some dishes. There was syrup all over the kitchen counter. Mother had walked away. I saw the syrup and I was starting to clean it up. She walked back so I stopped and went back to drying dishes. I told her that the syrup was there. She started rubbing a little bit. She got upset and stopped. I started again. I had put warm water on it and it had gotten hard like wax when it is cooling. I could peel it up very easily. I took those pieces and started peeling them up. She asked me how I knew to do that. I said that I just tried it. Something else about Jennifer K. We had placed something in the refrigerator, then we pulled it out laid it on the counter. I think that's where the syrup came from. After we finished the dishes, Bob F and I were standing in the kitchen. Mother came in and leaned her back against the counter. BJ came in. We knew that she was pregnant and she said she just wanted to ask us a question. She was thinking about getting an abortion. I said, how about if I invite this one priest, a family friend but not from the parish and not Father M, Father So and so to Matthew's party. Then you would have a chance to talk to him about it there. She said, oh, that would really be wonderful. I had a stuffed animal. One of the kids came out. I don't know if it was Rachel S or Bev as a little girl. I said Father so-and-so is coming to Matthew's party. She was excited. I said, so make sure you remember to bring him. Only I was talking about the stuffed animal, too. I was putting up Christmas lights on the outside of the house. It wasn't my birth home or my parent's house now. Then after I did that we all got bundled up, I don't remember everyone that was with us. I thought it was my Mother. It was Kay H and she was my Mother. We were going to a family Christmas party or something and we walked. Not all of the Christmas lights were working and I was kind of upset about that. I realized it was my fault because I didn't check all the bulbs before I put them up. I didn't even test them after I got done. I realized I had to go back out and work on them, fix them, the next day. As we were walking, we were crossing the street and there was something like a Christmas parade going on. It was dark outside. We went ahead and crossed the street just walking around some of the people marching in the parades and floats. They were almost like Disney characters or things that you would see in a cartoon. I can't make a good description at all. While I was walking around this, I was thinking, this is so cool. It's just like a dream. Then I said, it reminds me of that one other dream I had, with the Disney-like village. As we were walking there were also these kind of like booths, they were like little play houses. I walked up to the first one and they said, you can try to win a prize. They hand me this little cube, and they asked me a question. I had to show what kind of cube was the right answer to the question. I had to get all three questions right to win a prize. I got the first one wrong but they kind of cheated and gave me a clue and let me try again. Then I got it right and the next two right. For the prize they handed me a little film container with something in it. I didn't look to see what was in it. I was going to look at it later. I just stuck it in my purse. As I was walking, I saw that someone else had been playing something like a card game at one of the little houses. When I got to the house that person was done so I walked up and asked what she was doing. She had an option of a couple of different games. One game was like pictionary. One you could throw rings on a bottle. She said it was one dollar. I pulled out a five-dollar bill and then she said it's only 15 cents. I said, but you said it was a dollar. She said I'm trying to give you a deal. Just give me 15 cents. I didn't have 15 cents so I just gave her a dime. The game she brought me was like a puzzle where I looked at this vertical row of five things. Then she took it away and I had to pick up these pieces of the puzzle and put them in the same order. I didn't get it quite right. The second from the bottom thing was a cow but the cow on hers didn't look like any of the cows on mine. I told her that and so I said that wasn't fair. She said, just a minute let me give you your five dollars back. I don't remember her giving it back to me. They were closing for the night so we were rushing to get out of the way. They were rushing trying to lock up their little houses. I had someone else with me but I don't remember who it was. We ran because everyone else had gone ahead and I was kind of afraid we would get lost. Whoever was with me, I think it was an older Matthew, I asked him if he remembered how to get to grandma's house and he said he thought he did. We got there fine without any trouble. I don't remember being at grandma's house. When we were coming back, we were all driving separately. I got to this one place on the way back, there was kind of like a metal fence in a kind of fence. There was just a couple of inches of the fence sticking out of the ground and you had to drive over it into the maze, through this fence to the other side to get home. When I got in, I lost control of the car and I kept stomping on the brakes. It wouldn't stop. There were a bunch of other cars parked in there and I couldn't believe I didn't crash into any of them. I couldn't get control of the car and I couldn't get it to stop. Then it started turning back and sliding the other way, the way that I came from, and finally as I got to where I entered this place I was able to get control again and drive on out. I was the owner of the property. I could hear him yelling that someone was ruining his fence and he was going to get them. He was going to come out and I heard him yelling. Even as I was getting away, I heard him yelling that they got away but he was going to come after them. I got away. Then we were walking up the yard. Apparently, this was a very new house because there were huge piles of dirt and stuff out front. The outside of the house looked like plywood but there were full-grown evergreens too. We talked a little bit about that, something about the house and things that still needed to be done to finish the house."
"0243"	"(2001-05-31)"	"Typical Hollywood aliens, no clothes, big smooth head, dark eyes and features. I think they had something to do with Darren making himself more at home here lately and I don't like that at all. I'm trying to be nice and keep the peace during Graduation activities for Matthew's sake, but I really don't like Darren getting so comfortable here. I think I was saying to Matthew how much I enjoy it when he brings his friends over, how much I enjoy having them here. Even the aliens were okay. But I didn't want his Daddy getting so comfortable here."
"0244"	"(2001-06-01)"	"I was bike riding in this park with two other people but I don't know who they were. We decided to take this path. It was stone covered with these big, softball size, smooth stones. We took this path and it went down this hill, it was winding, curvy, and kind of. in waking life I would have taken it very slowly or even been leery of taking it at all. But I just; we just soared down this winding path of stones. We ended up at this place where they were taping a soap opera. I think it was, the one with Rick and Phillip in it -Guiding Light I think. We got down there and I said, look they're taping this show. But it was like there was this clear, barrier there but you couldn't see it, between where we were and where they were taping. There were different areas where they were taping different parts of the show. I asked someone if we could ask for autographs and they said no, not while they were working. So we walked through the different areas and saw the show. As we came back through we saw they were done and several of them were walking away. I was excited and I said, They aren't working now. Can we ask for autographs? They said yes. I ran up and asked for an autograph from the man who plays Rick. He was really nice. He gave me his autograph then put his arm around me and hugged me. Then he gave me a kiss on the check. He was joking around and then he kissed me lightly on the lips. He kept hugging me and so I hugged him back. Then he kissed me again on the lips. Then I also got an autograph from the man who plays Phillip. There was another one that I asked for an autograph but I don't remember who it was. , Rick and I fell in love. We decided we wanted to be together but there was some kind of, some people there that seemed to be from another country, maybe India. They had something like magical powers or potions. This one woman had this bowl of this stuff; it was pretty blue and enticing looking. She wanted Rick to taste it and she told him it was going to do something really good for him. I kept saying, No, Rick. Don't. Don't. I just had a sense that it was going to either change his feelings for me or change him in some bad way. He ended up not doing it. There was another bowl. This one was a different color. She was trying to entice him with this and trying to convince him that this one was different because it was a different color. I don't think he did. We were trying to get away. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We still had our bikes, but now there was also this flat bed truck and we were trying to load some things on this flatbed truck to take with us. It was mattresses and some luggage. Some of us were still on our bikes. three of us. It seems that there was another woman with us too. We were riding trying to get away. The scenery kept changing like magically and becoming dangerous. We just kept riding through it and as it we did the scenery kept changing and because we kept going and didn't let it stop us it finally went back to normal. The next thing I know we were at an airport. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We put all of our luggage on these conveyor belts. This one man was checking our luggage and he asked for our certificate. He found one in a piece of luggage. He checked it and it was okay. I realized there were several copies and only one copy was right. I told Rick There. That one in that luggage is the right one. We need to make sure we have our hands on it so nothing happens to it. So he grabbed that piece of luggage and tried to find it but he couldn't. We were running out of time and he finally grabbed it off the conveyor belt and tried to find it. While he was doing that I went ahead with Philip and Phillip was way ahead of me. And I said Oh yeah, I remember we talked about this in counseling. That he is like this and doesn't mean to be rude and it doesn't mean that he doesn't care or anything just because he is way ahead. not considering me being way behind. So I went ahead. The only other thing I remember is that it all worked out okay. Rick and I stayed together but I don't remember if we got married or not."
"0245"	"(2001-06-02)"	"I worked in this office. Bob F worked there too. I was reorganizing my desktop and my cubicle. I had all these extra desktop organizers and I was rearranging them to get the best lighting and for things to be the most convenient. I put some things away in cabinets and drawers. I pulled some other things out. I remember that I had some dolls and some things of flowers. I think Michelle Stewart [unknown in waking life] was working there also. They were thinking about moving us to a different area where there were all these desks in one big open area. She had kind of staked out the area, the desk that she wanted already. She had suggested a place for me and I said that I wasn't really interested in that one. I pointed out a different area that I was interested in. She said that was fine and she would let them know that. Bob F was waiting on me. We were going home together. I kept saying just a minute just a minute. He wasn't getting really frustrated but was saying, yeah, yeah, you said that already. But then in another scene I was leaving alone. We were meeting some other people from work for dinner. We were trying to leave without getting caught by the boss I guess. Before I left I was also trying to find a place to go to the bathroom first. I was having trouble finding a place. After that the boss almost caught me before I got out of there."
"0246"	"(2001-06-07)"	"I was at Margie D and Dennis D's house. It was a house in the country with a lot of land. I was walking up to the house with Margie D up this winding driveway. We had to duck under some of the trees occasionally. There were some flowering trees. It was hilly land. I remember that there was a lot of stuff out there but I don't remember what it was. We went in the house and I saw Dennis D. I commented that he was looking good. While I was standing there I was thinking about the fact that I had just heard that he had quit his job once to stay home with the kids. I remember when he kind of made a pass at me while they were dating and I was thinking about that too. I acknowledged the fact that it had been awhile since we had seen each other. Then two young children came out, Erin D and Dennis D Jr. Dennis D Jr. was being potty trained and was running around with no clothes on. I said something about Rachel S and her doing the same thing. Just joking around. There furniture was a eclectic, but from garage sales and stuff. The sofas and chairs were not all together. pieces on the floor. Samantha was laying in the back of a pick up truck and she was sucking on her finger. I was teasing her and I said, Yes, Miss College Graduate. She kind of grinned at me and said, Yes I need to work on breaking that habit don't I. Then I think Margie D came up. I spent the night there. I shared a bed with Margie D. The alarm was going off. I got up and was packing and getting ready to go. The alarm kept playing. I checked the alarm on my side of the bed and realized it wasn't mine. Finally, Margie D rolled over. I could tell she was getting ready to say something to me about the alarm, ask me to turn it off. I told her it wasn't mine. I didn't realize that it was actually something that I was hearing in the dream was my alarm in waking life was playing and playing and it didn't wake me. As soon as I hit the snooze button in my waking life, the music stopped in the dream. My suitcase was sitting on the bed while she was sleeping. I took my toothbrush and toothpaste and stuff that I wanted to take to the bathroom and some little stuff in one bag. I kind of moved the suitcase so it wouldn't be in her way while she was trying to sleep."
"0247"	"(2001-06-07)"	"Talking to Pam Ta about Sophia K not being at group lately and not hearing from her. I was telling Pam Ta how unusual that was. She had told me she wasn't going to be at one meeting but I haven't heard from her since. I was thinking about telling Pam Ta about this in an email. I was thinking that maybe Sophia K was doing this because the last time she missed I didn't write her to tell her we missed or anything. It's just very odd that she would not show up and not contact me."
"0248"	"(2001-06-11)"	"I was having my period. Twice I took a tampon out and put a new one in. I took one and wrapped it in a piece of paper no bigger than the tampon and pushed it together. I was in a car with Matthew and two other girls. Matthew was supposed to be taking one of them to the prom. He was in a black tux with a white shirt and white tie. I thought I really like that he decided to go with a white tie this year. Then I found out that the girls were sisters and they were both going with him to the prom. I was driving with the two girls and someone else in the car. I was driving from the back right passenger seat and was having trouble seeing. I was looking for a place to pull off so I could change places with the person in the front left so I could see better to drive. When I tried to pull off the road I was knocking over trashcans and stuff. Even after we made the change I was still. The place that I had to go forward and try to get out of there, there were all these trash cans and I kept running over them and knocking them down trying to get out of there. I also remember something about the road. It seemed to me that it was steep and very windy. the one girl, the one that Matthew was supposed to be taking to the prom, had some kind of psychological problems. I was supposed to be her psychologist and working with her and I said I couldn't work with her because she was gay and attracted to me. Of course, the feelings weren't mutual and she got really upset. I can't remember if she threatened to hurt herself or me. I held strong and continued to."
"0249"	"(2001-06-16)"	"I was at a CRHP meeting with CRHP XIII. While at the meeting they asked me to give my witness. I was unprepared, did not have it with me, as they did not give me advance notice. Before I got up to do it one of the CRHP XIII women got up and started talking about her wedding coming up the next weekend. There was a child, hers maybe, running around the room. The woman had very dark, short hair and was dressed in a purple suit. I decided it was going to be awhile. I realized that I had forgotten to bring any of my things to do the Maori drawing. So I told Judy that I was going to run home and pick something up and that I would be back. Judy had something on her face. It looked like a knit fabric that fit very snug and covered all of her skin. I noticed two other women wearing similar things but different colors. I asked her what happened and she said she had her face exfoliated but had not yet completed the process. I left to go home. While trying to go home I took a wrong turn and got lost. I drove quite awhile, and was out in the country, before realizing what I had done. I thought I had just turned right instead of left or vice versa. So I pulled into a driveway to turn around. For some reason my car was stopped and I just sat there. There were two gentlemen standing by a barn talking. The older gentleman finally came up to the car. As he was approaching I started the engine again and rolled down the window. I told him I made a wrong turn and wanted to go to Indy. I pointed the direction that I thought I wanted to go and he nodded that he thought that was correct. I turned around and left. I hadn't driven very far until I ran into places along the road where there were huge stacks of packages of frozen fruits and vegetables in the road making it very difficult to get through. This concerned me because I didn't recall seeing them there the first time. I kept driving and came to a dead end. I didn't see how this was possible because I hadn't made any turns along the way either time. A couple of gentleman came out and were arguing about which way I should be going. A lady came out who recognized me. She was very friendly, like we were old friends. She was a black woman. I barely remembered her. I kept trying to remember where I had met her. I walked with her a little way and through her house and I was just blocks from where I wanted to be. She was telling me about this store that I had introduced her to for great deals on bed linens. I finally decided that I knew her from SVH. She worked at the front desk. Her name was Sue Ann Williams. She was a black woman, very friendly and kind. We went into the store and she was showing me different things. I realized how much I wanted to have an income again. As we were walking outside again, I told her I wanted her opinion on something I had just done. I told her that I had just moved out of an apartment that I love because of money. I went from a 3 BR with an upper deck and a large LR to a 2 bedroom with a small LR. The cost saving was $400. However, as I was talking to her I realized that I had not given my current owners one month notice so it was going to cost me an extra month rent there. I also realized that we had not moved anything off of the patio, upper deck or two downstairs closets. I had no idea how we were going to fit all of my things into this smaller apartment. Plus, I love this apartment and was miserable about moving into this new place that was smaller and white walls, etc. She wouldn't say much. She said it was time for her to go to bed. She climbed into a row of beds along the street. But they were my shoulder height and they were all attached to each other. Tonya H came up and climbed in next to her. I grabbed a blanket and covered Tonya. I exchanged some pleasantries with Tonya but don't remember what it was about. As I was walking away I was thinking that I would need to get help to move the rest of my things into the new apartment. Then I had the idea that I would just find help to move my things back into the old apartment. that I would find a way to be able to afford to stay there. I went into this retail store that had offered me a job making $41,500 a year but I had turned them down because it wasn't what I wanted to do. I walked into the store and the lady I had originally spoken with was standing there and asked me if I had made my decision as though I had not already turned her down. I verified the income and then said that I would like the job. There were several other employees standing around that didn't seem to like that I was coming to work there. One was trying to put up a good front at least. The manager was very happy and went to get the paperwork. I was trying to tell myself that it was going to be fine and at least it would relieve my financial burden and worries. I'm having difficulty figuring out where the actual apartment move came into this. But I distinctly remember us doing some of the moving. We were at the new apartment with boxes all around us. I walked into one room and BJ was disappointed because she was trying to have that whole room unpacked before I saw her. She was almost done. After she left I started moving things around because she had the things that I use the most in low hard to get at cabinets and things I seldom use in the easy-to-get-to cabinets. This one wall was wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling cabinets, much like in Mother's kitchen."
"0250"	"(2001-06-16)"	"I was in my mother's hometown for business for a couple of days. Bev lived there and I went and visited her for a little while. I was feeling restless so I told her I was going to drive by Aunt P's and Aunt H's. It was 9:10 p.m. I said I bet they go to bed at 9 or 9:30 but that's okay. I'll just drive by and see if they are still up. If they are I might stop in for just a little bit. As I was driving there were these people outside and they had these big balloons, maybe 2-3 feet in diameter. There was a place that was roped off and the balloons were on string like maybe helium filled. I thought that maybe it was students doing some kind of a weather project. I went on over to their house and the lights were on. I saw them both sitting in the living room with their pajamas on. I stopped and knocked. Aunt H answered the door and was very surprised to see me. She thought that maybe something was wrong. I said, no I was just in my mother's hometown for a couple of days and I just stopped by to say hello because I saw you were still up. I sat and visited with them for a little bit and then left. As I was going back to my hotel, I guess, I stopped where these people were working with these balloons because there were more people there now. I asked them what they were doing. They were growing babies. There were all these babies born only with the head. They would take the heads and attach something that would grow a body. Then they put them in this balloon to allow the body to grow. They would float these heads in these balloons until the bodies grew."
"0251"	"(2001-06-20)"	"At a theater, we were rehearsing a play that I had written. I had purchased all the costumes, jewelry and accessories for all the actors in this play. There were a lot of them. There were two main female characters that I kept calling the divas. They were Audrey T and Karen Mc. For them I had bought black skirts, black suit coats, and black shoes. But they were each different. Not exactly alike. There was some jewelry. There were earrings. kind of like faked gem earrings but they looked very nice. Maybe some bracelets. For the rest of the cast, their costumes were Native American and something. This is weird. There was something almost like a black robe. They were really heavy. There were these hats too, that looked more like Mexican. Really weird and ugly. Yet, the jewelry was Native American. But I had bought them each a watch with black band but they were all different. The hats and clothing looked the same. When we were done rehearsing they were all getting ready to leave. I said Oh wait! I have costumes for everyone. You can take these home with you. Someone was helping me spread it all out on the stage so they could take it home with them. I had all the jewelry in a bag. I dumped it out. It was all tangled up and I was trying to separate it out. Someone was trying to help me separate it out and put the earrings together and the necklaces together. There were bracelets and then the watches. I was trying to remember. I had the Diva's earrings in a separate bag. I was trying to remember if I bought watches for them or not. I don't remember. I don't remember how that worked out. The earrings were very pretty. I don't know why I thought it was Native American because it doesn't look Native American to me now. I don't know why I said that. There were some children too. So there were two separate piles of costumes. They didn't look Native American either. They weren't the black either. Someone picked one up. It was a jacket, not like a suit jacket, but it was loose fitting and colorful, like maybe orange or yellow. Someone said something about the people would. maybe I made an apology about the costumes. and someone said the audience would love it just like they would the play. And I thanked them for saying that about my play, that people would love it. Audrey T and Karen Mc came out with their jackets on but not the skirts. Audrey T said the skirt just didn't fit. I told her she could just wear some black slacks or something with it. So she started trying on shoes to decide which shoes she wanted. Then Karen Mc came out and said her skirt didn't fit either. She said she could only get it up to the bottom of her butt. She said maybe could wear something to cover the rest up. I said no, no, if you have a black skirt at home or black slacks, just wear that with it."
"0252"	"(2001-06-27)"	"I went to the Y to play racquetball with Matthew and a friend. I don't know who it was, just that it was someone I know. We were going to play doubles. The fourth was one of the employees of the Y - the young black man with a beard and Afro that is there quite often. We were assigned the last court. We went in and there were piles of boxes and shelves in the back right of the court. It left very little playing room. The Y employee wanted to play around it. I was upset and didn't see how that was possible, but we decided to try anyway. Then we didn't have racquets. We were trying to play with metal kitchen spatulas. Obviously, we kept missing the ball this way. I finally decided to go ask at the front desk if they had any racquets. The front desk area did not look like it does in waking life. There was an open area that we walked into. They were very busy. Several people behind the desk. which is unusual, and lots of customers on the outside of the desk. I asked for racquets and they handed us two. When we got back to the court we tried to use them but they weren't made for racquetball. One was more like a golf club. I finally went back to the desk and asked again. This time they were going through what they had trying to find what I was really looking for. They pulled a couple out that I told them were Ping-Pong paddles. We finally got two racquets. When I got back to the court I realized they were both bent. Half way up the racquet the rest of the racquet was bent towards me. This time when I went in I saw some other employees were clearing all of the mess out of the back corner. I thought that was good. Somewhere I saw Garnet P. She was there working. something to do with paint and crafts. She told me I had to complete my paint work. I stopped my racquetball to do what she said. I began mixing some paint and got some on the sleeve of my black cashmere winter coat. I was very upset and said I wasn't going to do this anymore and didn't know why I had to do it anyway. Someone said it was part of the class. I said I wasn't in the class. Garnet P tried to clean off my coat. I also had paint on the back of one of my favorite black heels. She tried to get it off of there too. These people who were painting were in the halls everywhere and making it very difficult to get around and to the courts. One woman sitting next to me was painting this mailbox, maybe on ceramic, as it had form to it. First she painted the whole thing a rust color. Then she painted what would have been the open space sky blue. She painted the mailbox yellow, the grass etc. green. I think there were also flowers. After everyone had finished the instructors were talking about people's work. They especially liked this woman's ability. She had also painted a picture of herself. Garnet P was just there as a representative of the paint company. They were also looking at two large collages that the group had made. Some of it was done with the tubes of glitter paint like I use. One woman drew something and they were teasing her about being a piehead. She was swimming, looked something like a turtle, and she had painted pictures of pies in front of and behind herself. I was walking around trying to find my shoes. I found them but in doing so stepped in some black paint. Then, I accidentally stepped on a piece of paper that appeared to be painted solid yellow. I was worried that I had ruined someone's painting. Then I noticed several other similar pieces, of different colors, that others had stepped on too, so I didn't worry about it anymore. I pointed to the stain on my shoe to Garnet P and asked her how to get the rest of the paint out. She hushed me and said just a minute. I made my way to the racquetball courts. I looked in each door trying to find the one that Matthew and the Y employee were in. When I found it, I went in just as they were going out a side door. There was another man sitting in there and I asked him and he pointed that they had just gone out that side door. I was aggravated."
"0253"	"(2001-07-01)"	"Mother and BJ wanted me to have my annual check-up at a hospital other than SVH's. I went to satisfy them but was very upset the whole time. they wanted me to partially undress and have the rest of my exam in these area where passers-by could see me. I got very angry and decided to leave. I was hurrying around looking for my winter coat and handbag. They were saying things like I was overreacting and being silly. I just grabbed my things and left. very angry. As I left I saw, through a window accessible to all, a pregnant woman being examined. I went back to SVH's. I parked my car in a lot four blocks away. I was with someone but I don't know whom. There were several cement walls about waist high. It seemed to be in a bad part of town. The environment was not at all like SVH North Campus. not the surrounding area or the building itself. I went to the elevators to go to an office but I'm not sure where I was headed. It was a six-sided self-standing elevator. that is, not encased in a wall. The outside was all gold and very ornamental. I wanted to go to the 2nd floor. The elevator closed without me so I grabbed something on the outside and let it carry me up one floor like that. Meanwhile, other people were waiting on the first floor for the standard elevator. I'm not sure if I got where I was going. I was walking around and noticed there were a lot of people around. It now felt more like we were in a hotel lobby. I realized there was some kind of trade show or something going on. I decided to go check it out. While I was walking in I realized all of the vendors were just setting up. I was going to look for the WDF booth and thought that I should call someone and see if Marcia N could come and work the booth. As I was walking around I saw booths for people like CFC, only they had a different name now. I realized they had merged with another company and changed their name. Then I saw my own booth. I realized then that WDF did not have a booth and that I had forgotten I had signed up to do this. I went over to my booth space and the only thing there was a three-panel cardboard background that someone had placed there for me. It was very unprofessional and sloppy looking. It had two handmade signs that had been made by Jane Cr for one of my Happenings programs. They were cloud shaped and had been written using several colors of markers. I was thinking about what I would need to get set-up. The booth next to me was just the same, I think it was an insurance agent. I knew her. She was asking me what I typically do for these shows. I explained to her and then told her I was just on my way home to pick up materials before the show starts. My booth was in a corner. Don H was running the show. I told him I needed a table and tablecloth. He took a corner table piece and tablecloth from another booth. I grabbed an extra chair that didn't seem to be in use. The other vendor also had ice and soft drinks which I accidentally moved an ice cooler and a big bowl of ice to my booth. I went and returned them. When I came back someone else had placed cups of ice and 2-liter bottles of soft drinks at my booth. I realized whoever was sponsoring the event was placing them at all the vendors booths for the attendees. I was thinking about what literature to bring and how to make the most of this show. I thought I would offer a free mini interpretation for people and then have those names to add to my mailing list. I also realized that I might need to print and create some materials at home before I returned. I was aggravated for not being prepared already. Two people who were attending the show came to my booth before I could leave to get my materials. I talked to the two of them a bit. I told them I normally charge $50 for a dream interpretation but today, they could sign up to get a mini-interpretation done free if they signed up for the mailing list. The younger woman immediately wrote a check for $15. Apparently she misunderstood me. Her check was like a business check. I realized instead of giving the interpretations free at this show that I should sell them for $15. That way I would make some money for it and they would have more value for the show attendees because they had paid something for it. I was glad this had happened when it did to inform my decision. I was looking for something to write on to give her my name and address, as I didn't even have my business cards with me yet. The woman she was with, I think it was her mother, decided to have one done too. While they were doing that they had a little dog running around like crazy. I was trying to stop him so I could pet him. At times he would kind of jump up on me, on my leg because he was so small. He reminded me of Janet C dog that I called a rat dog. About the height and length of a cat, yet smaller body. Very short haired. He was dark brown and black. When I left to get my materials it was pouring down rain. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella in with me. I bent over and was protecting my head with a paper. Along the way I realized that even though it was raining very hard, I didn't seem to be getting wet. I got to my car, went home and came back. Again I forgot my umbrella. When I got inside I realized I had only picked up one of quite a few things that I needed and that I needed to leave again. The woman in the booth next to me had changed our booths so she had the corner spot. I switched them back. When she came up she said something to me. I told her I paid for a corner booth because it is better exposure. I guess I must have walked away because when I came back she had taken over the corner again. This time she had moved in all of these big items for an elaborate display. I was sandwiched in between her and another large display. I now had one straight table and it was sitting sideways to fit in between the other two. You couldn't even see my display. I found Don H again and was very upset about this. I told him I wanted it fixed and wanted my corner back. He tried to explain to me why she needed the corner and that it had something to do with client privacy. I don't remember my response, but basically I wanted my corner back. I told him that he had about an hour to fix it. He said he couldn't believe I would say that. I explained that I simply meant I had to go home to get the rest of my materials so he had an hour to figure something out. The woman in the insurance booth was ignoring me now- obviously she didn't want to interact with me after what she had done. The man on the other side of me was trying to make me feel better about my space. I overheard Jane Cr and someone else saying that wasn't right what was happening to my space. They acknowledged that my service is very popular to people and that it deserved the right space. I left again to go home and get materials. It was still raining very hard and I wondered again why I had not remembered my umbrella. Again, even though I was simply holding a paper or something over my head I noted that while my body was not protected from the rain it was not getting wet. This time I couldn't find the lot where I parked my car. I went to it from the other side of the block but then the surroundings weren't familiar so I couldn't find it. I came across several businesses, some with overhangs where I could be protected from the rain for short periods of time. I think one was a hotel and two were fast food restaurants. I think one was KFC. I don't know what the other was. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't find my car. I finally went to the other side of the block, thinking that I should be able to find it that way. I think I did find the right lot just before I woke up."

"0255"	"(2001-07-06)"	"I was driving through my mother's hometown. I wondered if I was dreaming and said to myself No, I know I'm not dreaming right now! I was driving into or through a church parking lot and it was as though there were several weddings going on. There were many people and I saw several women dressed as brides. I was trying not to hit anyone as I drove through. The next thing I remember is that I was on roller blades and I was going around my mother's hometown High School. I don't remember now what I was looking for. I went around the back of the school and kept going into these woods. There was snow on the ground now and I kept roller-blading. I noticed prints in the snow and realized that there were wild animals around. At first I thought it was a wolf and then I noticed a white bear. I pulled some type of cord down from above and distracted the bear with that cord. He started chewing on it so I moved it in a direction that I could get away from him. I headed back where I came from. I passed another white bear but he didn't come after me. Now I was back at the school parking lot. I crossed the front of the school and went in to ask for directions to where I was going. Jennifer F was in there with some friends. I sat down with them. She told me she knew how to take blood pressures now. I told her she could practice on me. First she started feeling around on the side of my hand. I told her she had to find a nerve, and pointed one out on my inner wrist. This is odd because I would have been taking a pulse not a blood pressure. She cut a slit in the skin of the second finger on my right hand and slid her finger on the skin and pressed on a nerve to find it. I jerked my hand away and told her she was hurting me. She tried again and I did the same thing. I finally told her that she needs to do it on the outside of the skin not inside. I went back outside and headed somewhere else. I think I was headed to Aunt H's again. I got lost and asked someone for directions to Dair Ave. Somewhere along the way Bev joined me. We were laughing about how well we were roller-blading. I was able to jump up on sidewalks and jump from sidewalk to sidewalk across driveways. I counted eleven in a row once that I jumped. We were standing and talking to someone about not having learned how to stop yet we were both stopped and I was trying to figure out how to explain that. I found my way to Dair Ave. I recognized that I was on the right street.  "
"0256"	"(2001-07-08)"	"I had a dream group meeting. There were nine people there. Louise H, Sophia K, Dan M, Lou S, the others I don't remember. Mark M was not there. I was getting very sleepy towards the end of the meeting. Our discussion got way off track. I said something about this being a very interesting conversation. It could go on for hours, especially when you talk about multiple personalities and the fact that if they have MP do they also have multiple souls and multiple spirits or some combination. I was having a very hard time keeping my eyes open while I was saying that. After the meeting was over I thought everyone was gone and I went to pick up the money. I thought there would be $90 but there was only $3. I was very upset and realized I didn't say anything about them leaving their money before they left so it was my fault. Still, I was disappointed that not even Lou S, Dan M and Sophia K left their money. Surely if they had left theirs, the others would have done likewise, and those three know the routine by now. Still, it was my fault. Matthew was helping me put the chairs away. There were two little yellow rocking chairs, like I have in waking life, and one adult size, like them. I said I don't even know where the extra two came from. He asked me where the one blue chair went and then two or three people came out of the kitchen. One was a very dark-skinned woman from India who had her hair and face completely covered. I asked if she had paid yet and got the sense that there was going to be some kind of problem."

We still had four of the puppies. I was playing with a caramel-colored puppy and realized it had been a long time since they had a bath. I decided to get Sir Gallahad's brush and brush them. I thought that brush would work fine since they were just puppies and very small. Their hair was matted, kind of like an old stuffed animal. After I brushed them, their hair was silky, soft, just like Belle's. Someone said all the puppies hadn't had their shots so we couldn't give them away yet. That was when I realized that I had already given three away. I realized we could get the two back to get them their shots but we couldn't get the other one back from Kidwell's."
"0259"	"(2001-07-21)"	"I went to church. When I went up to receive the Blood of Christ, the Eucharistic Minister was trying to use a new phrase and she couldn't remember it. She was mumbling and kind of being flippant. Finally she just said, oh well, The Blood of Christ and then just continued using that phrase. I was standing in back when church let out and I was trying to push my way through the crowds to get to someone (or something) quickly. before I missed them or it. Matthew and I are in the car. He is driving. We were behind some buildings and he was going to park right behind a bunch of emergency vehicles. fire engines and ambulances. I told him he couldn't park there but that he could park anywhere else along the building. We never did park. The next thing I saw were people going through kind of a drive-thru window for something but it wasn't a restaurant. I told Matthew to drive around them and leave. As we were getting ready to leave we saw a young black man giving someone in another car something that looked like aspirin from this giant bottle. He approached our car. I was curious so I told Matthew to stop. He gave us two and it turned out they were batteries that looked like aspirin. He gave us a bottle of them. the size of a regular aspirin bottle. As we left I was telling Matthew what an ingenious marketing idea that was. Now I'm driving, and really fast because Matthew was going to be late for work and he had to get home to change before going to work. I sped through a yellow light. I accidentally drove through a red light. As soon as I realized what I did and ran three more in a row. I couldn't seem to help it. I was finally able to stop the car, a screeching stop, for the last one. At that time I realized there was a police car ahead of me, but he didn't do anything. We're at the church office. There were three desks sitting in the lobby. I thought it was odd the way they were set up because two of them, the two in front, had their backs to the door and where people would come in. Matthew and I had gone into the back of the church and brought some things into the office. Matthew was sitting at one of the desks typing something that he needed to leave there. It was due or overdue. Just as he thought it was done he realized he had typed it in all caps so he had to retype it. While he was doing that Julie O came out and I commented about the desks- that she had gotten that beautiful new desk unit and now they took it away and put these desks there. I didn't tell her what I thought of the two that had their backs to the door. She made some comment to say that this was a good thing. Of course she would, whether she really thought so or not. That would be the nice Christian thing to do. I was giving two other women that came out the other things that I had carried into the office from the back of church. The paper bag had things in it that people had been making in the back of church. They reminded me of valentine things but were very large, made out of large colored paper. I said I didn't know what they were but that they kind of looked like Valentine things. They were puzzled by that but then mentioned something about Alice S and I said, yes, she would be working on that about now. So they took the bag. After they took it I found some others lying on the floor. I picked them up and placed them on one of the desks. One of the things is my little cedar chest that normally sits on my dresser. It was full of pictures. The pictures on the bottom were of Matthew and I. At first I told them I wasn't sure what it was and when I saw the pictures of Matthew and I on the bottom I said, Oh, now I know. Someone saw my chest sitting here with these pictures so they just put their own on top. They agreed that made sense. We saw a few of the pictures that had been added. The people were naked, some had body paint, but you couldn't see any genitals or any of the women's breasts. They took the chest and I told them that, of course, I would want the chest back. They said of course, but they didn't bring it back. As Matthew was finishing his typing I asked if I could take the chest back with me now and someone went to get it."
"0260"	"(2001-07-22)"	"I had just secured a job working here locally for NASA. Our quadrant was in the middle of a crisis. NASA had commercial airliners and one of the pilots had crashed a plane intentionally. At first they did not realize that he had survived until a subsequent incident. Two pilots, a husband and wife, were sent on a mission to try to stop the criminal pilot. The husband was Anthony Edwards, actor. I walked/ran with them through many of the checkpoints/security clearance points to get them securely into their aircraft. I was in training. I was trying to get security clearance and the equipment was not taking my SS number. I realized that someone had entered a 0 before the number and that was causing the malfunction. No one knew who had done it so we suspected the criminal pilot. I was the first to realize the criminal pilot had survived when I saw him reappear, almost as though it was a scene in a movie. He came up from the ground in a very surreal/ghostly manner. In another scene I was having anxiety about accepting a position with NASA. I wasn't at all sure I was up to the task. I kept telling myself that I had to give myself time to learn the ropes and I had to maintain my confidence. I met a woman who had not been working there very long. She had names in blocks on a clipboard and some were scratched out. I realized that she was fairly new, not as new as me, learning and making mistakes also. I found that very reassuring. I went to my station, standing at a piece of computerized equipment. I remembered that Raina D worked for NASA and decided to call her and let her know that I was working there. We spoke for a little bit on the phone. After getting off the phone I knew she would tell Barry C about this and that might change his mind a little about me. I decided to go to lunch. I went and changed into shorts and sandals so I could exercise on my lunch break. Raina D showed up at my station and warned me. She asked me if it was okay to take my lunch break now. She told me they are very particular about things like this. There was a gentleman working at a station right next to me that she knew. I had not been introduced to him yet. She introduced us and told me that he is a great source of information and I should ask him any questions I have. As she was telling me this I was slipping on the sandals. I saw on other people going to lunch and I saw Raina D, in particular, meeting someone for lunch. I asked the gentleman about lunchtime, length, and the appropriateness of using that time for exercise."
"0261"	"(2001-07-22)"	"I was working for this man in a store in the mall. I'm not sure what kind of store it was. maybe a pet store. The only animals that were there were a whale, a cow, and a goat. and later a calf. The store was a very contemporary decor with deep vivid colors. One color in particular that I remember is purple. There were also a few very long steps leading up to a main open area. That was the majority of the room. The only thing I remember being in here though was a large aquarium tank holding the whale. The whale was not the same size as it would be in waking life. It was approximately 5 feet long and its diameter was slightly smaller than my own. I was very concerned about the whale. I kept adding water to the tank and the whale kept getting out and I kept putting it back in. I had put the whale is something similar to a pillowcase because I thought that would be better for it. Later the owner told me that the whale was dying and there was nothing we could do to save it so I took it out of the pillowcase. The whale just lay in the water from that point on. We realized that the goat and cow had gotten loose and gone out into the mall. There was another young woman and a young man that worked there. The goat came right back but the young woman and I were going out into the mall to look for the cow. There was another woman there, I believe she was the lover of the storeowner. She was going to go to the left in the mall looking for the cow and the other girl and I were going to the right. Before the two of us left, however, I suggested we call mall security and see if anyone had called a reported the cow on the loose. I have a sense that I didn't like the owner's lover very much so I didn't care if she was out searching the mall needlessly. We did get the cow back from security. Then we realized that there was a calf missing so the female employee I was with was going out into the mall in the other direction and search for the calf. There had been some joking around about me going to bed with the owner. I was teasing him that he had never been with anyone like me, no one else would measure up after, etc. He had an apartment above the store. I went up there once and saw him in bed with the other female employee. I don't know how I knew it but he was one to sleep with a lot of different woman for no reason other than sex. The cow was dying also so we let the cow and whale lay together to comfort each other until they died. I went upstairs to talk to the owner about the animals dying. I was very sad and saw that he was too. We were especially sad that the whale was dying. I asked if there was anything I could do for him. He said he would just like me to lay and cuddle with him to give him comfort. I thought that would give me comfort as well so I agreed. But things progressed as he teased me a little bit. Unfortunately, it didn't stop there and we ended up making love. But it really was that, not just having sex. It was incredible. He had undressed and then I undressed while he watched. I was wearing black lingerie. The one female employee came up and saw us in bed together and was very upset. He called me later and told me he was done with other women. That he was very surprised because he had given up hope of finding his soulmate but he knew he had found that in me. I felt the same way. The other female employee and the male employee were both upset when they learned that we had made love. The male employee was jealous and hurt that I chose the owner instead of him. The owner and I ended up getting married. I came downstairs. We closed the store and locked the door. Someone was knocking at the door and I couldn't see who it was. So I put the chain on so I could open it safely and see who it was. It was something about the goat or the calf. We decided to change the store, I think into a restaurant. The next time I went upstairs to the apartment he had completed remodeled it. It was fairly contemporary in decor. probably not what I would choose in waking life. but I loved it in the dream. The floors were all hardwood. It was one huge open space. The bedroom was upstairs in an open loft area with a winding staircase leading up to it. There were several area rugs on the floor. I was looking for the stereo. I wanted to put some music on so we could dance. A doctor came to the apartment because I was having some type of physical problem. I was observing the doctor my husband and myself. I was talking about how I looked. re: the medical problem. The doctor had me bend over towards my toes and she was looking at my face. My husband came down from the bedroom are. We were talking a little about money. It had something to do with a $1,000. He said, It's no big deal. We'll spend what we need to spend and if we run out we'll just get more."
"0262"	"(2001-07-25)"	"I moved back into the house on Lakeland Drive. With Darren but not to share a bedroom. I was thinking very intentionally about this. Even though we were going to be sharing this house I certainly wasn't going to share my bed. I did think, momentarily, about reconciliation, and thought immediately. Oh, NO! NO WAY! Then I wondered why such a thought would even occur to me because it just repulses me to consider that. We bought it from Margie D and Dennis D, initially. They said they were moving and I said, maybe I should buy it from you. After I moved in it seems that there was someone else involved. I noticed that the paint in some of the rooms was still the same color as when I had owned it previously. There was a listing in the paper for the house and it said two bedrooms and a loft. I laughed that they called the third bedroom a loft because it was no different than the other two rooms. It was a one-story house. In the one room, all the walls were kind of like sponge painted. I looked up and they had done the ceiling too. I realized they had done it to look like clouds. I thought maybe I could leave the ceiling like that. Then I noticed that on the ceiling they had used stuffed animals. One of the stuffed animals was a Teddy Bear. On the walls they had made the white parts look like butterflies. In one room they had a big splotch of paint. In one room there was a framed picture attached to the middle of the ceiling. In another room there were two things attached to the ceiling, not necessarily in the middle and not aligned but a seemingly random placement. They were abstract in design but after studying them I realized they said LE1. I didn't know what this was and then someone brought a bottle of men's cologne in. It was called LE1. A man sprayed it all over himself and we still couldn't smell it. I said I hadn't heard of it before. Audrey T and Karen Mc were there. Audrey T had done something and she was embarrassed. I hugged her head and kissed her on the head and told her I loved her. The third room I was making my office. It's like I was sharing it with Karen Mc. There were several windows in that room. I was excited to get that room just the way I wanted it. It was spacious. not like in waking life. Someone had moved all the furniture in without me guiding them. I was anxious to begin moving the furniture around. I told Karen Mc and someone else how I was going to set up my desk and credenza by the window. But I was going to set up the desk so it was coming out from the wall into the center of the room. Probably have my computer facing the window. Karen Mc said she figured I would do that and since it was my house she couldn't really say anything. I said, well, maybe we can have your sewing machine by the other window."
"0263"	"(2001-07-25)"	"I was trying to track down Vince P. I somehow knew about a DDSI meeting. I drove part of the way but then I was walking through this office complex. several different office buildings. I found the DDSI meeting. I was sitting at a round table with 8-9 people. Jeannette T and Marcia N were there. I thought, oh, they do both still work for WDF. I recalled that I had thought about contacting Marcia N for a job before but now see that she is still happily working for WDF. I also noticed that they did not present themselves as they used to. They used to be very particular about their appearance regarding make-up, hair and clothing. At this meeting they appeared somewhat unkempt; no make-up and their hair kind of messy. Marlene F was there. I was surprised that she was there. I decided that she had perhaps bought a franchise in FWI. Later, at the meeting I think, they were doing something and talking about something in a treasure chest. Vince P and someone else wheeled in this very large gold square box that was supposed to be a treasure chest. Vince P was pulling it into the room by a rope. It was about 4 feet high and 4 feet square. Now it seemed as though I was sitting with Patti C and the treasure chest is small and sitting on the table in front of us. We are looking at the contents. It is all bags of candy. We realized that each kind of candy represented a different award so we were counting each kind of candy to determine how many of each award there was. The only kind I remember is Jelly Beans and that was the one there was the most of. One of the franchise owners was standing up talking to Vince P and Joanne N. I think they were recognizing what they had done for the franchise owners. She was pulling out these little toy figures, about two inches tall. They had been buried under the bags of candy. Each different figure under a separate kind of candy. When I realized this I tried to put the candy back exactly how I had found it. I went into the DDSI office and was looking for people I know, just to say hello. I realized that Joanne N was the only one there that I knew, but I decided to go ahead and say hello. I walked into this office building lobby and there were these three unusual people. I don't know how to describe them. It was an older couple, that resembled gnomes, but they were the size of normal people. Their cart was being pulled by a man-like animal. I have no idea how to describe that better."
"0264"	"(2001-07-25)"	"I was using a cardboard box as a car, driving through BR. People were driving on an area between the buildings and the sidewalk. It was very narrow and in waking life a car could certainly not fit on it. It kept getting more and more narrow. I thought that it was easier for my box/car than it was for people in normal cars. I got out and kind of folded the box up and continued because it became so narrow. I then realized that I was walking head on into cars coming from the other direction. So I turned around quickly and headed back the other way. I decided to go around the other side of these businesses to get where I was going. I'm not sure how it happened but my box/car got soaking wet and I was afraid it was going to fall apart. It brushed up against my bare leg. It left a dirty spot that I wiped off after pulling the box further away from me. I got to the restaurant where I was meeting someone. I unfolded it and set it up and then entered the restaurant for lunch. When I came back out it wasn't raining anymore. But I was concerned that my box/car was sturdy enough to transport both of us since it had gotten all wet. However, it now looked more like a car but not a regular car or even a convertible. But there was a portion that resembled the front seat of a car. It was very sturdy. The person with me, a woman, said it had dried out some and was good and sturdy and would be fine."
"0265"	"(2001-07-27)"	"I had been on the phone with Doctor Pf's office. He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car. As I was almost at the car, Doctor C came out."
"0266"	"(2001-07-27)"	"I woke up, in the dream, not from the dream - and got out of bed and went into the hall and noticed that Matthew's room was full of people, wall-to-wall. They were in there to watch a PHS event from the window. PHS was right across the street. Their practice football field was right outside our window. They were watching the band practice. The band was in uniform. Apparently maintenance had left my front door open so people were just coming in and sitting in Matthew's room watching the band practice. I thought, How dare they just come in here and do this. A little girl wanted something to drink. I didn't want to encourage this so I decided to take her across the street to get a drink of water. It was like we lived on a city street. She didn't like it that I did that. She was about 3 years old. I brought her back to her mother and went downstairs to the kitchen and these two young girls came in and asked if they could have some more of my chocolate chip ice cream. They were already eating some. They had taken it and put it on cookies. I thought, how dare they just help themselves to the food in my kitchen, too. I just thought that the next time I am just going to have to make sure that my door stays shut and locked so people can't come in like that. I was talking to some woman. I think she was a sister. We were talking about some place that I wanted to get a job. I said, well, it's on the same block as PHS. She acted like she either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't believe me. So I pointed out through the window. PHS looked like a city school. It was a several story, red brick building. I pointed just past it, a couple of buildings down. I said see it's that one. She said oh yes. I said, see, it's in the same block as PHS. She said yes, yes. Later she was packing all of her things and telling me that she just took a new job there. I thought, Well. How strange is that? I just got done telling her that I was trying to get a job there and now she is telling me that she has a job there. I wondered if it was the same job or maybe it would work in my benefit. Since I knew her maybe she could help me get that job."
"0267"	"(2001-08-02)"	"I was with the cast from friends. We found an old, abandoned boat, kind of like a cabin cruiser, and climbed on board and checked it out. I found all these compartments. It looked like solid wood blocks but sections would swing open and reveal compartments. They were all attached though. I don't know how to better describe that. Joey fixed the engine so it would run again. We started running it down this lake. We met some men that paid us to transport some things up and down the river for them. They stayed on board with us. Monica was the chef. She was baking different types of muffins. I ate one before I realized she didn't want us to. She said something about the vanilla ____ ones. That is the kind I was eating. It was chocolate on the bottom, vanilla on top and then some type of special icing. Some of realized that the men that we brought on board were drug dealers and they had us transporting drugs for them. Monica was the last one we told about this. We were trying to figure out what to do."
"0268"	"(2001-08-03)"	"I went to Len U's funeral. He was a member of BPE. he was a gentleman who attended the Mensa meeting also and had sent me an email about networking for jobs. This makes me think that it wasn't Len U at all but rather another man that I had met at Mensa and BPE and as described here. When we were at the funeral home I saw his wife and maybe a daughter. When I saw him in his casket I didn't think it really looked like him. We were getting in line to view the body. As we were walking to get in line there were other people laid out in their caskets as well. There was something about after the wake gathering for a meal."
"0269"	"(2001-08-04)"	"I went to visit BJ in this new place that she was working. It might have been a school or college. It was an old building in disrepair. She was showing us around the building. I saw her poke her finger in a hole in the wall just noticing it I suppose. She was taking us somewhere. I think Bev was with some other women and me. We were going down steps and then all of a sudden we were going up steps. I noticed that she was smoking and I said something to her about that. She said, well, if you had been through some of the things that I have you would too. I responded, did I? I was insinuating that I did not start smoking as a result of any of my life tribulations. However, I was also thinking that I was being a bit dishonest because I did smoke for about three months after my divorce but no one knows that. When we were going up the steps, at the top of each flight we had to climb over a rail to get to the next flight. It was a little difficult to do. On one of them I saw another woman get over more easily and I was trying to figure out how she did that. It looked as if she just stepped down on the rail and then stepped over it. Later we were waiting to use the bathroom but there was only one. I thought I had seen another one so I went around a corner to check but there wasn't one. There were some people working in that room and another young woman that told me she was in hell year. I asked her what that meant and she said it meant she was a senior. She said it had taken her so long to get to her senior year. I told her it would be great and she should appreciate her final year. I went back out and I don't think I ever did get to use the bathroom. We went into a very large meeting or banquet room for a gathering. It was all open, no chairs or tables around. It was Christmas time. Someone was sitting with a large bag, kind of like the type you see in the Christmas movies being used by Santa. She was emptying it onto the floor. It was full of shower sandals. They were all black and the straps were glittery gold. I think there may have been some presents in it. A man drove a little tractor and trailers into the room. The trailers were full of presents. Several of us ran up to him right away but we had to move so he could get close to the tree. We were taking the presents off of the trailers and putting them under the tree and watching for the one with our own name on it. I remembered that we had submitted a list of things we would like so we would get something specific that we wanted. I noticed two toy typewriters for two of the little girls. I thought it was kind of neat that they asked for the same thing. BJ's gifts were oversized document frames with no glass in them. One of them had fallen apart and I thought that was pretty typical for document frames since they are so flimsy. there were these really huge frames with no glass in them. They were maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. They weren't wrapped. I was trying to pick them up but couldn't. I realized I couldn't because there were two men standing inside of them. One of them noticed me and stepped outside the frame but the other man didn't. I wasn't close enough to him to get his attention. I kept trying to pull the frame so it would rub against him, which it did. He kept noticing but he wouldn't move. The program had now started I guess. Finally someone else nudged him and pointed out that he was standing inside the frames and they helped me lift the frames from around him. When we were sitting the wrapped presents around the tree I was trying to set them so they looked nice. Some others were just stacking them on the floor. This annoyed me and then I realized that it wasn't worth being irritated over."
"0270"	"(2001-08-05)"	"I was in this big dining hall. There was kind of like a Christmas party going on. Maybe for WDF or for DDSI. There were all these Christmas aprons hanging from wires above my head. They had the wires stretched from wall-to-wall. The aprons had various Christmas designs on them. I thought I should get one because I had intended to start wearing an apron in the kitchen. As I was walking around the room, there were tables displaying things that people had made. The things that I remember most were drink pitchers with matching glasses. They had painted designs on them. I was in a car with John Mu and Terri S from KTC. I don't know where we were headed but John was driving. We were seeing Halloween decorations at different places. As we went through underpasses, we saw that someone had put up giant Jack-0-Lanterns. This is next to impossible for me to describe. The best I can, is to say that where there were open spaces the Jack-O-Lanterns showed through. There were umbrellas and very unusual decorations. We stopped at one house and I don't know why. There were two young boys who lived there. They had built something they called an elevator out of wood. They had a rope that you pulled to lift yourself to the second floor. Right outside on the second floor was a patio door. Terri S said she was going to play with the boys, go outside, and use the elevator. The boys noticed her right away, came out, and asked what she was doing using their elevator. She came back down. The boys said something to their parents about someone using their elevator. She got back in the car and we left. I was debating with someone over whether or not to wear these gloves. I was at a theater. We were getting ready to produce a play. I was not supposed to be in the play. I don't know what my role was. At first, it seemed like we were doing a play of My Fair Lady. Later it seemed like we were doing a children's play like Barbie. It seemed to change several times throughout the dream. I don't remember what it ended up being. I spent a lot of time with the male producer/director back stage. Something like a hand vacuum was broken and he was trying to fix it, though he was unsuccessful. He was using a very small hammer. I took the hammer from him and told him to let me help. I decided I needed a larger hammer so we were looking for one. I finally found one and I fixed it. He was grateful for that. We started talking about very common things that I experience, but he had never had. Things like chips and salsa. He was very wealthy and just had not experienced very ordinary things. Over the course of us working together, he fell in love with me and he asked me to marry him. I said yes. We didn't tell anyone at first. The backstage area really sticks in my mind. There was clutter everywhere. At one place, you had to step down into another area. You stepped onto a floor of car batteries. There were two different levels of batteries. You had to walk on them instead of the floor. You couldn't even see the floor. He was waiting to tell the cast and crew about our engagement. It somehow got out but I don't know how unless he told someone. Most of the crew and cast were very happy for us. I was talking to someone about jobs and trying to find jobs that we really love. I said that I had been in school plays and that I really loved doing that. This is true in waking life but I would not imagine myself doing that full-time in waking life. She was encouraging me to pursue that as my full-time job. I had been thinking that was watching the other actors perform, that I should have been behind them practicing and learning the moves. I thought that would have been a good move for me, but I didn't do it. The play was a musical with a lot of dancing. I thought I could have learned the moves if I had practiced with them instead of just sitting and watching. I could have done this. Later the word got around to the whole cast about our engagement. One of the main female cast members was attracted to him, very upset about this, and intended to make sure it did not happen. It was almost as though I was watching a film. I wasn't with her or overhearing her, but watching her talk and interact with other cast members. Her and these other women were all dressed in costumes that remind me of My Fair Lady. Later, another woman, not in the cast, shows up and is talking to him. Again, it is not as if I am there watching, but I am seeing it. This woman is talking to him as though they are in a relationship and nothing has happened. He is very cool towards her and she doesn't understand why. I'm talking to this little girl. I asked her name and she said Annie H. I told her that is one of my favorite names because my middle name is Anna and my favorite Uncle used to call me Annie. I told her some about Uncle A. She said she was very happy that this man and I are going to marry. I don't know who she was, maybe a member of the cast. Several times he and I kissed. Usually, very long and passionate kisses. One time it was right in front of other cast members. That must have been when they found out. This news caused so much trouble with the cast that I think he backed off and I can't remember if he actually changed his mind. He was going through a lot of turmoil about whether to marry me or not."
"0271"	"(2001-08-08)"	"I was at the sleep center. I saw Dr. C. He had let his hair grow long and it was hanging down in his face and gotten it highlighted. It had blonde streaks in it. I passed Dr. W. We said hello as we passed but that was all."
"0272"	"(2001-08-12)"	"I was the owner of a large styling salon. A salesman came in to demonstrate and try to sell me a vacuum. It was a very powerful machine. I tried it out by vacuuming the entire salon. I used the attachments and vacuumed hair from around the baseboards. I accidentally moved the attachment right by a client's face and the stylist insinuated that the vacuum removed her facial hair from that side of her face by complimenting the client on how beautiful her skin was. I looked and noticed that she had facial hair on the other side of her face. I didn't do or say anything else about it. I finally told the salesman that I was going to be working on budgetary items during the coming week so I would be able to give him my decision then. I wanted the vacuum but I also think I was trying to give him an excuse rather than saying no to him at that point. My husband owned an auto and appliance repair business right next door to my salon. I went and talked to him about my intentions with budget and that I was considering some business changes that would improve both sales and profits and allow the stylists to make more money as well. I found out that my stylists rarely get any tips. I suggested that we should put a little sticker on the corner of each of their mirrors that says Tips are appreciated as this is an important part of our stylists income. When I first started talking to my stylists about some of the changes I was going to make all but 2 or 3 of them got up and quit. Eventually they all came back. I think as they spoke with the ones who stayed about the changes they became convinced that it would be a very good thing. My husband wasn't very supportive but he didn't stand in my way either. He didn't want me to do anything with his business though. I did suggest that they put up a basketball goal on the corner of his lot so the employees could relax a little on their breaks by shooting hoops. I also thought this was something that the employees wanted. I don't know if it actually happened or not. there was some kind of an evil person trying to sabotage my business. I don't remember much about this part. I did find out later that he was connected to my husband. as though my husband was behind it. I managed to get rid of this person though and the changes were being very successful. The stylists were dressing much nicer when they came to work. They were much happier, getting nice tips, and the clients were very happy with the changes. There was one stylist that was the hardest to win over. She had studied clinical counseling but then decided to become a stylist instead. She took care of her clients in a private room so they could speak privately with her while she took care of them. She wasn't acting in an official counseling capacity but used her knowledge to help them while she was taking care of their styling needs. She combined them in a manner as to not put herself or us in any kind of legal jeopardy. She was very happy when I encouraged this and gave her a private room so she could do so more effectively. Her clients were especially pleased with her. They had something to do with an airline or flights. There was a person that looked like or was dressed like an angel or a fairy, with sparkling wings that fell gently from the sky. She landed, or her wings became caught, on something like bleachers. This is where I found her and freed her. She was somehow connected to my husband and this evil person that I had to deal with earlier. Maybe she was a distraction. "
"0273"	"(2001-08-12)"	"I was asleep in my apartment and I thought I heard noise in the next bedroom. I thought that the noise sounded like it was coming from my parent's bedroom, on the other side of my one wall. In waking life the other side of this wall is the neighbor's apartment and my parents do not live with me. I picked up my flashlight from the floor on the left side of my bed and shined it in the doorway. I was scared to see what the noise was but shined the light there to look anyway. I was shaking and very frightened. Finally, my parents entered the room. Just after they did though I realized they were a kind of apparition. They floated into my room and fell on me in the bed. Just as they did was when I realized it was an apparition of some type. It startled/scared me."
"0274"	"(2001-08-14)"	"I was trying to give myself a perm. Someone else had started it but then they quit. I was determined to get it done so I was trying to roll it myself and I was getting really frustrated. I had taken them out and started over. My hair got dry so I had to completely wet it again. At first I was starting to make rows on the right side above my ear. I tried that a couple of times and then I decided to start on top and get that hair out of the way first and then do the lower rows."
"0275"	"(2001-08-21)"	"I'm at the Holiday Inn at MI. I check in at the front desk. I go to get on the elevator. I had a garbage bag of clothes to be donated to Goodwill or someplace. As I was standing there waiting for the elevator two men come and stand right in front of me for the elevator. One of them has a cart and the other has a trash bag larger than mine. I told them, you know if there isn't room on the elevator after you two get on that I will be mad at you. They kind of stepped to the side and the elevator opened so I went in first. Then we don't have our trash bags anymore but there are quite a few people on the elevator. The elevator car is pretty full. It starts making noises. It is kind of jerky and moves side-to-side. Everyone is pretty nervous. I was thinking, I want to get out of here. I need to get out of here. We are headed to the 6th floor. It doesn't stop and it goes back down again. I get off at the second floor thinking that. I don't know if I didn't realize that I was not on the 5th floor. I started walking to find my room. There were several large businesses having meetings out in this open area instead of in meeting rooms. I had to walk by them to get to my room. I'm looking at them trying to figure out what the companies were. I realized one of them is LRJ. I saw Carol H. She saw me and calls out to me, then comes over to where I am standing. We say hello and hug and chat a little bit. She looks a little different, like she had gained a little weight and she was wearing glasses. We had a nice chat and she said she had to get back to her meeting. I need to go find my room so I walked away. I am trying to find my room and I realize I don't remember my room number, I don't have my key with me and I don't have my luggage. I asked someone where 650 or 620 are. They tell me I am on the second floor. That is when I realized I am not on the right floor. I had to walk past these meetings again. There is very little room to walk through. There are people sitting at the ends of the table but not up next to the table. So I had to walk between them and the table. I keep walking. One of the groups is having a sit-down dinner. At two of these tables the women are having mashed potatoes and gravy. They put potatoes right on the tablecloth instead of on a plate. I was wearing a white suit. As I walk between these women and the tables to squeeze through I get their mashed potatoes and gravy on my suit. They don't seem to care and don't apologize. One said, well, you can get that out with a little soap and water. I was nice and polite and said, Yes, I can. I went on. I get back to the elevator and really don't want to get back on because I was so scared the last time. There are other people standing there waiting also. There is a row of four elevators. Two of the elevators are standing open but there is camera equipment standing in the open. As the doors try to close they close on this equipment so they can't close all the way. The next things we see are the doors moving side to side. I started thinking Oh no. Here we go again. At first I thought maybe if I got on another elevator it would be okay but I now realize that all four of them have the same problem. I don't remember getting back on or off the elevator. I see Kendall B standing and talking to a group of people. I'm standing there looking for a little bit wondering if it is really him, because he looks a little different. His hair is a little fuller and has streaks of gray. After he finishes speaking he walks up to me and I introduce myself. He said it was nice to meet me. Then another man walks up and introduces me. At that point I realize this is his life partner. I'm talking to the two of them and quite a few children kept coming up to us. I realized it is their children. There were approximately 8-10 of different ages. His partner asked me what I do and I wasn't sure how to answer that because of my unemployment. I talked a little about my dreamwork. I told Kendall B that I had some communication with Doctor Du about the sleep positions so we talked some about that. Then Kendall B was telling me that they were there doing some work and he had to hire someone to help him. He said if I had known that I lived so close by he would have called me. I said that would have been wonderful. I was really disappointed that he hadn't contacted me. His children were doing something with videos and stuff. They were talking about going to their rooms and have TV dinners in their room. There were boxes that looked like they had about 10 videos to a box. Kendall B said, That's what we have to do. I looked at him quizzically because I didn't know what he meant. I asked, What do you have to do? He said, You don't know? I said, No, I don't. Please try to be kind when you answer me, so I don't feel even more stupid for not knowing. I don't think he or his partner either one answered me. The boxes were kind of flat and two rows of five movies each. We are outside. One of their children is reaching through a fence and trying to kill a rabbit. I said Oh no. Please don't do that. I said I have a pet rabbit at home and I would really hate to see you hurt one. So they stopped. Then this rabbit caught another animal, a smaller animal. I thought he was going to kill it to eat it. The rabbit got the animal in a position to where he could bite it in the neck and it died. I hated seeing that. I don't like to see any creature killed and I certainly don't want to witness it. Kendall B or his partner were saying, that's the cycle of nature, trying to make me feel better. Then there was a male on the other side of the fence trying to kill a rabbit. I got upset again. I thought, Please don't do that. He had already killed one but he did let that one go. I said, that kind of looks like Sir Gallahad except those have more white on them. Sir Gallahad is a Mini-Rex and his coat is really soft like chinchilla."
"0276"	"(2001-08-24)"	"I was pregnant and experiencing labor pain in my back. In waking life my back was aching from walking the mountains today. I don't remember who my husband was but he was there along with another man. I was also trying to get married before I had the baby. There was a problem with the dress and something else I think. The pain in my back was worsening so I knew birth was near."
"0277"	"(2001-09-05)"	"I was with Karyn L. I was in the car with her. We were on the way to pick up Carmen A and to catch a plane with the rest of our classmates to Australia. We were driving and we turned left on this street and we knew we had to turn left again. Karyn L said, This is where I always get confused. I never know exactly where to turn. She turned where her and I both thought she was supposed to. There was a car parked there. I thought there was enough room to get through. Either she didn't think there was enough room or there may have been some bars there. I was sure that was the way so she told me to go ahead and check. But it was raining. I didn't worry about that because most of where I would be walking was under cover. As I was walking I realized that there was another way that I thought she could get through. When I get through and turned around and looked I realized that it was the right place. I don't know how Karyn L ever actually got through there. We didn't just pick Carmen A up. We were in a theater. Carmen A was there with some other people. It seems that maybe some of our classmates were there. Someone was talking to us about our trip. I eventually went down to the front to sit. There were knee-deep piles of popcorn all over the place so I was eating some of the popcorn. Some of it had a lot more butter on it than others so I was reaching for that. There was an activity that we were supposed to participate in. just like a fun exercise. I don't remember what it was or what happened. Then, Daniel R showed up. He and I talked for a little bit. It was as though nothing had happened and no time had passed. I took him to introduce him to Karyn L and Mary Kay C and someone else. I was disappointed because they said hello and not much more. Karyn L got up and walked away. I was upset with Karyn L, when she met Daniel R, that she didn't grill him more or ask more questions or anything like that. I stood there and talked to him more. We walked away and continued to talk. I realized that my class was either practicing or participating in some activity on stage. I think they were practicing so I ran behind stage quick because I realized I was supposed to be there. Carmen A had on an aqua blue dress. It had an apron. She was like a waitress. Another woman yanked an apron off of her. She had two on, one on top of the other. She gave the extra to me along with a cup and a sugar jar like you would see in a diner. I set the sugar jar and the cup down while I was trying to put on my apron. I realized that my apron didn't fit well. I had to tie it around my waist and the ties weren't quite long enough. By the time I got ready the number, practice, whatever was done. We had ordered dinner to take with us. While I was waiting for this I started talking to Daniel R again. He was saying that he was going to be getting an apartment here in Indy and maybe looking for a roommate and only a female and only if it was a relationship. I think he was hinting around about it being me. I just thought that there was no way I wanted to do that again. Even being with him there was no way I wanted to be intimate with him. I was thinking that the last time I saw him he was saying the same thing. He just disappeared for a year and now he just shows up again. I was trying to pin something to my collar while I was listening to Daniel R talk to me. All of a sudden I realize that I need to go. I grab my food and run and try to catch the others. I'm not finding them. I don't remember if they left without me or if I just need to catch up with them. We had actually flown to Australia, done part of what we were supposed to do and flown back. We had less than a day and then we had to get on the plane and go again. I was thinking that if I hadn't been standing there talking to Daniel R and futzing with my collar I wouldn't have missed them. I had really mixed feelings about him being there again. There was a part of me that wanted him to stay around with me and another part that just wanted to tell him to go away and leave me alone and never come back."
"0278"	"(2001-09-07)"	"I had gone to a morning OD meeting at a restaurant. There weren't very many people there and it wasn't structured. People were getting up and walking into the kitchen. Some were just walking around. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I talked primarily to one gentleman. I was trying to get something useful from this meeting. He was talking about OI. In waking life I have no idea if there is even such a thing. It seemed as though it was industrial OD. I was asking him if he thought that was a good area for me to pursue. I kept stressing that I what I want most to do is use my training/lecturing and writing skills. The whole meeting seemed very unhelpful. I left there and went to the anniversary party. I got there late, in time for the reception. I missed the mass because it had started earlier than I thought. I was aggravated with BJ because she didn't tell me what time I needed to be there. I wondered if people got videos of the Mass so I could at least see that. They were taking lots of pictures. One thing that was particularly unusual is that there was a corner curio cabinet with glass shelves. There was a space in the back of the cabinet between the back of the shelves and the back of the cabinet. They were having people sit in the cabinet in this space. They were taking pictures of each person in attendance in this cabinet and they were putting things on the shelves that represented each person. They were thinking about what to put on the shelves to take my picture. There were some barbecued chicken wings that I was eating. Bob F asked me how they were. I was nice and said they were good. I thought the sauce was good but that if had bought the chicken at another store they would have been juicier or more tender and with more meat on them. There was one table that members of the Harris family were sitting at. They had a very large tray and they had made high piles of desserts on it like cake and brownies. They had filled it full of things they were going to take home with them. I was taking the slices of cake off looking for something but then putting them back on. Linda W said that was fine as long as I didn't mess up their cake. Kim H went to the microphone. This was a dream within a dream. At the end of the dream I was with my siblings telling them I had this dream and that we could use it to see what things happened that we didn't like and what things we did that we especially liked but maybe weren't planning."
"0279"	"(2001-09-08)"	"I was on GC campus but with my CIIS classmates. I was talking to Terri O, asking her what to do about my class with Elisabeth K. She didn't answer me. She had some notes in a notebook that she had me copy down. I asked her if she was going to be putting it on-line and she said no and looked at me funny. I said, I'm sorry. I only asked because I thought you had previously. I was having trouble reading her writing but went ahead and started copying it. We were all sitting around waiting to leave to go home. There were two men that I was talking to. Something came up about chicken mcnuggets and they didn't know what they were. I was trying to explain it to them and I saw some sitting there. So I picked one up and took a bite out of it. As soon as I did I realized that was nasty because I didn't know who they belonged to or ho long they had been sitting there. Bonnie K was standing there at a counter next to me. I was cleaning up and putting plastic forks and spoons where they belonged and throwing some trash away. Just generally cleaning up a little bit. Then I heard we were having a burn drill. Half the people were gone already but we still went outside and had it. There was a big dip over to a high area of grass. Instead of going down and back up I just jumped across and barely made it. Where we were supposed to congregate we were supposed to form a circle but people wouldn't spread out very well. Where I was standing it was very crowded so it wasn't a single circle of people, but rather some of us were bunched up. I don't know what a burn drill is. We were supposed to sing a song. One half of the circle was supposed to sing first and then the other half was supposed to sing it. Carmen A was standing next to me and looked at me kind of funny. I don't know what that was about. Then we went back into the building. The CIIS staff was packing up and getting ready to go. They had tons of boxes of stuff sitting around all over. I made a comment that the hard part comes now, packing all that stuff up and getting back. They said they just had to take it to the basement, but, yes it wasn't a pleasant part of the job. Then Matt O walked up and I hardly recognized him. I said something to him about being dressed up. He had on a sports jacket and a tie. His sports jacket was kind of royal blue and he was wearing his glasses. But he was also wearing a toupee. black hair. that covered his whole head. I told him he looked really nice. We were talking out together. I was carrying or pulling my bags but he had a four-wheel cart full of stuff. We were walking out to catch the plane. He was teasing me about some other man wanting me. I looked at him and laughed. I put my hand on his arm and said, oh, do you Matthew? He said, Yes. I do. He kind of laughed. I apologized and said I just couldn't resist. That it was just a perfect set up. He said, no problem. Then I realized that I didn't know why he was walking with us because he was driving back to LA rather than flying with the rest of us."
"0280"	"(2001-09-09)"	"Cindy S was dead. For some reason we had to exhume her body and there was someone else that we had to bury. I think we were going to bury this other person, maybe, right next to where she was buried. We didn't want to do it at the same time because we didn't want to impose on the S's while they were exhuming Cindy S's body. We talked to one of the S boys to make sure that wasn't going to be a problem. They assured us that it wasn't. Steve S was her brother. [but he was her cousin in waking life] I think Paul S was also her brother. [Paul S was also a cousin in waking life and deceased] . Maybe Tim S and Don St, though they are cousins also. In waking life, Steve S, Paul S, Don St and Tim S are all brothers. When they exhumed the body it wasn't in a casket but was wrapped in. It almost looked like aluminum foil but it was much larger than if the body was just wrapped in foil. It was like there were a lot of layers. I can't really explain it. I also don't know who the other body was that we were burying. Cindy S was alive again. Then she was dead again and they reburied her. After they reburied her I was wearing a necklace of hers. I don't know if she had given it to me or how I got it or why I was wearing it. Her father, not her waking life father, came in to church and sat down next to me because he had not been able to be present at the time that they exhumed the body and then reburied her because he had to be at a business meeting. I showed him the necklace to reassure him that it was her and that she was doing well and tried to give him some comfort. I thought how sad it was that on such an occasion that he could not be present because of a business meeting. We were back at the cemetery and I was picking up these sticks. In diameter they were the size of a pencil but they were much longer. On the end they had a kind of crook on them and they were light green. I was picking them up and sticking them in the ground at each gravesite that something had to be done to them. I was trying to find these open, vertical pipes or something so I could put the stick down into the pipe. I did four in a row. It was to mark the graves for something that had to be done later. Some of the graves had folded lawn chairs sitting up against the tombstones. People would come and sit there at the grave of their loved ones. One of them was Uncle E. I was thinking that Aunt M probably goes and sits there quite often."

"0283"	"(2001-09-17)"	"I was a very young girl. I think it was me. But I have a mixed sense of whether it was me or if I was observing. I needed to find a place to live and so this man gave me an apartment in his building. He was the landlord. But in exchange I had to be with these different men and I had to get pregnant and have a baby. At first I didn't seem to mind it but I think after the baby was born he would carry us upstairs several floors to his apartment and then he would throw us down a space between the flights of steps. There was space in-between the flights of steps that just went straight down to the bottom floor. You could see all the way down from the top floor to the bottom. He would knock us down in this space to kill the baby, even though he wanted me to get pregnant and have these babies for him. I was trying to escape. My father, who is in a band, was going to take me in. I went to this apartment with my father and his band and it turns out that they wanted the same thing from me, only with them. It started out that he asked specifically who I was supposed to be with. It just wasn't working but I didn't know why. I asked my mother if she thought it would be okay if I had sex with one of the band members instead. She talked to my father and he said it would be okay. [unknown] They started playing music. I was supposed to start being romantic and having sex with this man. I went up to the one band member that I was attracted to and I started flirting with him. He was the keyboardist. He quit playing and sat there and then we went out to a car. My father followed us. He opened the car door and was very angry. But he was angry because this band member was apparently impotent. I think my mother must have intervened and calmed him down and asked him to let me try anyway. There was all of this fine powdery snow inside the car, waist high to the band member that was sitting in the driver seat. So my father used his hand and was brushing the snow out of the car and then agreed to let me try and it worked. I think my father was doing the same thing as the other man. He was trying to kill either the band member or the baby afterwards by throwing them down the same space between the flights of steps. I think either I or someone else ended up throwing him down the space in-between the steps."
"0284"	"(2001-09-18)"	"I was on a teleconference call with Darren and someone from the child support office. She was asking questions about the status of our child support agreement. As usual, I was getting more and more angry with Darren and found myself yelling at him. I was flipping through my file cabinets while I was talking to try to have the exact numbers in front of me when I spoke. I said, you make $56,000. Then I hesitated and changed it to $74,000 a year and still think that $70 a week in child support is adequate. He then told the other person on the phone that he wanted to file a petition for the child support to go directly to Matthew. While I was talking on the phone BJ's family arrived, suitcases in hand, and Matthew was taking them into his bedroom to get settled. I'm not sure why they were here, especially to spend the night. I noticed that Mike A was with them and I couldn't believe it. Then I thought I don't know where I am going to put all these people as other members of my family were going to be arriving as well."
"0285"	"(2001-09-19)"	"I was preparing for a party to celebrate receiving my certificate for a part of my program, not my Ph.D. I was living in this big fancy house. Reminds me somewhat of Tom G and Shirley J's old house except that it wasn't well decorated, not a lot of decorations. Obviously much different than my current home. All the doorknobs were___can't describe it. I'm getting ready for this party and worrying some about it because my whole family is coming for it and I don't know where I am going to put everyone. I wanted to hide something but someone convinced me to just let it out in the open and let people know that I'm not afraid. Mother and Daddy ended up bringing most of the food for this dinner. I was going to set up my card table and folding chairs and hope that somehow we would have enough room. People started arriving and I wasn't ready yet. For some reason I was feeling very angry and I couldn't identify why. I was very upset. I went to my bedroom to change and left everyone downstairs. I came back down because I heard a terrible scream and commotion. Nicholas F was running around in a panic. Bob F was trying to gather his other children and saying, we are going to the hospital now. They weren't planning on coming back. I gave him directions to Community North Hospital because it is the closest and they can get there very quickly. All of his children had been roller blading in the street in front of my house. Apparently, someone had rollerbladed over Nicholas F's hand and cut it very severely. Bev came up to my bedroom after I had returned there to try again to change my clothes. She talked to me a little bit. I apologized for how I had been talking earlier that day and told her that I had been in a really bad mood and not even sure why. I didn't tell her this but I was thinking that part of the reason for my mood was Nick R. I finished dressing and went downstairs. Everything was ready. The BBQ they had made. I had started making mashed potatoes and that was there. Dessert was there, etc. I had to go back upstairs for something and called downstairs to Bill F and asked him to get the folding table and chairs out of the coat closet. In the meantime, Bev, Mother and BJ were getting the food on the table. While I was upstairs I was talking to someone and asked if anyone had heard from BJ. Then I said oh, yeah, duh. She's here. Then I asked about the rest of her family. Todd A was the only one that was there. Nobody knew if the rest of her family was coming or not. So, we were ready to eat and I grabbed my lighter because I wanted to light a bunch of candles all over the house. I was trying to do that while other people were getting their food. Darren was there for some reason and he had invited his family. But they were all older black people. They were bothered by Bob F's children and the other children running around, playing, and creating a commotion. I was talking to Mother and Daddy about Darren and his family being there. I asked them if they thought we had enough food. It seemed to me that they were planning on eating. Daddy said we would just have to wait and see. Upstairs I was trying to light a candle on a little round table like I have in my bedroom in waking life. There was a leg missing on it or something that was preventing it from standing level and from standing on it's own. So I couldn't get the candle lit there. I had difficulty lighting some of the other candles as well."
"0286"	"(2001-09-19)"	"Someone was trying to break into my house through the front door. I realized that I did not have the alarm set, even though the dead bolt was set and the chain was on. They were trying to break the wood. I was leaning against the wood of the door to try to keep them out and I reached up and set the alarm. As they heard it beeping to set they took off. I looked out the peephole and saw that it was three young males all dressed in black. As they took off they had to run over a huge pile of rubble in my front yard that resembled the piles of rubble rescue workers are going through in NY right now. While I was dreaming I thought that's what it looked like. I realized the alarm wasn't working because it didn't set. I ran and got my phone to call 911. They came back and started trying again. I called 911 and could hardly speak. They found something to unlock the deadbolt. I managed to turn it back again and hold it against their efforts to unlock it again. Then I saw the chain was off and reached up and refastened it. I looked through the peephole again and one of the young men was looking through the hole back at me. I wasn't sure if he could see me. I kept to one side and was looking out at an angle. I slowly moved my finger across the hole to be sure he wouldn't see me. They seemed to be making progress at getting the wood in the door to give. I placed my back against the door where they were trying to make it break in and then I placed my feet against the steps directly across from the door. I thought this would keep them from being successful."
"0287"	"(2001-09-22)"	"I was preparing to fix myself a meal. I went to the freezer and decided that I should eat something that I have had in there for some time. In the process I found things I didn't realize were in there or things that I had forgotten were in there. I took a round, forest green tablecloth folded in half out to the front porch, deciding that I would eat out there for a change. It was a classic picnic table like you would see in a park. There was already a cranberry colored tablecloth on the table so I placed the green one, still folded, over part of one lengthwise side of the table so you could see both. I think I placed something else on the table too but I can't remember what it was. I went back inside and started rearranging the things in the refrigerator. Now I was working in a dorm-side refrigerator, finding all kinds of things. I thought, I keep forgetting this one is even here. I found things that we had put in that freezer, leftovers from my son's high school graduation party in June. There were two packages of hot dogs; each one had been opened so I combined them. There were ziplock bags of sliced cheese and crackers that I decided to put in the other refrigerator so I would remember to use them for my bedtime snack. There was a package of sausage. As I was moving things I found some very old lettuce in the back. I took it out and laid it aside to throw away. I also found an individual serving bottle of juice with no lid on it. There were a couple of things that were just a bite or two and I took them out thinking that I would just consume them now rather than keeping them and I wouldn't dare just throw them out. I took the juice bottle out to drink right away as well. As I was picking up the lettuce off the floor I put it in the sink to put in the garbage disposal. Now it was much more than when I took it out and there were other things as well. It filled one side of the sink. While I was doing this, there were three men sitting at my kitchen table. One of them was interviewing the other two about 911. They kept glancing at me and what I was doing. For some reason I also had tools and parts lying on the floor around me as though I was fixing the refrigerator as well. I realized I would have to move some of these things when they were ready to leave or they would not be able to get out. I did this as I saw them wrapping up and they got up to leave. The interviewer left and the other two stood there and talked with each other. The one started crying because the interviewer had given him such a hard time."
"0288"	"(2001-09-23)"	"I was in bed listening to an audio book. Matthew came in and lay down behind me and put his arm around me. I took the headphones off and asked him if he was okay. I could hardly speak so I had to ask him three times. I don't know if he answered me. Then we were in a car driving to my parent's house. Matthew was younger now-maybe 12 or 13 years old. He was asleep in the car. As we approached my parent's house I realized we hadn't eaten yet so I decided to drive to Oldtown to get some fried chicken. Matthew woke up and was upset because I was going to do that. It was about 3 a.m. and I asked him if he wanted breakfast instead but he didn't answer me. I told him it wouldn't take long. I found my way even though I wasn't sure I remembered how to get there. It didn't take as long as it would have in waking life and the roads to get there were different than in waking life. The place to park came up on me quickly so I quickly diverted off the road into a roadside parking area. When I got out of the car Matthew was already out and had crossed the street to a house. It was dark but they had lights on. I saw the door open and saw my family, particularly daddy, sitting inside. I wondered whose house that was and why they were in there. I didn't even think about why Matthew went there or knew to go there. As I entered the house, Mother met me and started talking to me about people with ADD and how other people misunderstand them and misinterpret their words or actions and don't give them enough credit for how intelligent they are because of that. I wondered why she was telling me that and wondered if someone had told her about my having ADD. I was also still wondering who the house belonged to and had a sense that the family had gone together and bought this house for me to make up for things in my life. I quickly realized, however, that the house was BJ's new house and they were just moving in. Matthew and I went to the refrigerator and found some kind of green fruit juice. I had to kneel on the floor to get it and got dirt on my black pants. We then went in and sat in the living room. Jody S was talking about ADD like she was an expert on the subject. I realized she was quoting the audio book I had been listening to but she wasn't giving the author credit. I was upset and thought that wasn't right that she wasn't giving credit to the author. I finally stood up and walked a little bit and said Jody S, how do you do that? You just quoted the book I've been listening to. She looked at me like she didn't like what I had said. That was okay because I didn't like that she was passing this knowledge off as though it were her own or as though she knew these things from researching the topic. She just shrugged her shoulders and didn't say anything. I sat back down next to Matthew and then he started doing it. I jumped up and said basically the same thing to him. I was very upset that other people could remember this book verbatim."
"0289"	"(2001-09-23)"	"Actually they are just sounds. It sounds like fireworks or explosions that you would hear in a battle. At first I thought they were the latter."
"0290"	"(2001-09-24)"	"I was working as a dream therapist, consulting clients. In this building there was a lot of construction or it was being majorly remodeled. I was in this room that was going to be my office and sitting area. There were several people sitting there waiting to see me. It started out with just one and then all of a sudden there were five sitting there waiting for me. None of them had an appointment. I came out and was trying to take care of them. Shirley H was standing there also, but I'm not sure why. I had a sense that Matt O. was there but I don't recall seeing him. I spoke briefly with Shirley H and then went to the five people who were waiting for me. I'm really sorry there are so many of you waiting for me, but since none of you have appointments, let's see what each of you need and see how we can take care of each of you. Three of them had computer questions, based on things that they had heard me say before, that they thought I would be able to help them with. One of them was trying to install a program and but it told her she needed higher walls. Another one was trying to install a program, I think it was maybe like Anytime, but every time she got to one point her program would shut off. Since Shirley H was standing there I asked her if she was busy or in the middle of something. I told her that these three people had computer questions that I couldn't answer and thought she might be able to. She said she would be happy to talk to them. So I sent three of them to her. I then went to another of the women was there. She said she was there to talk to me about a client she had referred to me. Neither of us could remember the woman's name. So I went to my computer. I knew who she meant and what day she was in. So I went to my appointment book. Somehow my computer showed me the picture of these people, sitting in my waiting room. I was trying to go into the actual appointment book part to look up her name. I was having all kinds of problems with the computer. I somehow couldn't get the mouse where I needed it to be. Someone said something to me and I turned and looked over my right shoulder and there was another computer. Somehow I was trying to use my computer using the mouse from that other computer station behind me and too the right. I said, I don't know what my mouse is doing back here anyway. So I picked it up and brought it back to my computer. I was still having problems and I called Shirley H and asked if she could help. I thought, I know what I'll do. I'll just reboot. About that time Shirley H reached from behind me and unplugged it. I said no, no, no. She had already unplugged it and plugged it back in, so it restarted. It turned out to be fine and it just took a little bit longer. I finally found the woman and her name was Linda Coland [unknown in waking life] . I asked this other woman if that is the person she was there to talk to me about and she said yes. I went over and sat on a footstool in front of her. She was a thin woman dressed in black or burgundy. She had shorter length black hair and glasses. She was very thin. Maybe my age or a bit younger. I think maybe Shirley H sat down with me too. She was there to follow up with me regarding this person she had referred to me. She asked me how my session with her was and what the follow up was. I just told her that my session went fine and that I had referred her to Doctor Bl. This woman was very upset by that. I apologized and told her that I thought that was the best thing I could do for Linda. I helped her as much as I could in our session. I asked her why that bothered her. She said, well, I wish you had referred her back to me. Well, I didn't even know who referred her to me, let alone know that it was a psychotherapist that had referred her to me. So, she kind of shrugged her shoulders and left, I think. Actually, I think I did that before the other people showed up and that's when I found out three of them had computer questions. The person that was left was Linda Coland. Before I could get to her, she walking around looking at my shelves of books in my waiting area. One of the construction workers came up to and asked me if I wanted a partial wall or anything in my office. I said by all means. I said, what I would really like is a full wall with a door. So, I went and was standing and talking to this Linda Coland. She climbed down from something and walked under a ladder to me. She said, I'm doing very well. I'm doing much better. I said, I'm so happy to hear that. Let's go into my office and sit down and talk. So she went ahead in and by then they had already put in this wall and two doors. I though I would pull the doors shut which I tried to do. There were these white, looked like logs, in the way. I tried to move them out of the way with my foot but they were too heavy. So I bent over and moved them out of the way with my hands. I pulled the doors shut but they wouldn't meet. There was a six-inch gap. I said, Oh, look at that. That's such a shame. That's alright, we'll just leave them like that for now. I went in and sat down to talk with her."
"0291"	"(2001-09-25)"	"I can't place where we were, but we were someplace for school. I spoke with Monty about my paper and he was irritated, disappointed. He was talking to me about my paper and how there were several questions and I only answered one of them, and even then I only answered with a couple of paragraphs. It was just barely passing work. He just didn't understand and was really bothered by this. He said, I'm sorry. I said, no, don't be sorry. I feel the same way. My work has not at all been what I would like it to be. This aren't really excuses but. I told him about the year I've had being unemployed, etc. So unfortunately it was not just your class that suffered. It was the others as well. In some way that made him feel a little better. Still, he was a little disappointed. So I asked him if there was anyway to make it up or to redo the paper or add to it or anything. He didn't think that was possible. we were laying in the grass together, like spooning. There was clearly some affection there. I don't know what that was about."
"0292"	"(2001-09-25)"	"I was walking around outside. I was sitting on a stone ledge. Connie B and Susan J were there. I was talking to Connie B about the old house. She said there were so many people living in there with her right now. She was so frustrated. She said the families, and one maybe in particular, had a bunch of cats living with her in her room. One part of the dream I am with Paulette W, Joan Collins, and another woman. There is a man there too. Paulette W and this other woman and I are under the control of Joan Collins. I don't know why. We're so afraid of her that we will do whatever she tells us. She tells us that it's time to go have sex again. Something happens to interrupt us and the man and Joan Collins and the other woman walk away and I am talking to Paulette W. We're getting dressed and washing up and talking about how horrible this is and how much we don't want to do this. We decide to get dressed hurriedly and try to get out of there before she comes back so she can't find us. I'm not quite dressed and we here her coming. So I just grab my clothes and we take off running for the elevator. We realize that we don't have time to make it to the elevator so we run into a bathroom. We each go into a stall and close the door but we stand on the toilet so they can't see our feet. Someone, and I don't know if it is one of us or someone else, is actually going to the bathroom when they come in looking for us. They obviously don't see us because we are standing on the toilets and can't see our fit or anything. I am afraid that she may be able to see our heads above the top of the door so I am trying very hard to make sure she doesn't see any part of me."
"0293"	"(2001-09-28)"	"I was in Las Vegas. I got to my room and dropped off my things. I put on my teal wool suit and headed down to the casino. I was walking through the casino when I saw Diane S and her dad. I stopped and said hello. We were both very surprised to see each other. I asked her why she was there and she said for fun and vacation. I told her I was there for work. We chatted a little bit about Vegas and told her that I had been there just a year or so ago. She said her and her mom love to go out to the beach. I told her that the last time I was there I only got outside for an hour the whole time I was there because I was there for a conference. I didn't know if I was going to have time for fun this time either. I told her it was nice chatting with her but I needed to meet my colleagues. As I was walking through the casino I was walking through all of these different rooms. In each room there was a group of people celebrating a certain college. Each room was a different college and it was parents and family of these college students. As I was going through one of them, someone handed me a cake and asked me to carry it to housekeeping for them. I don't know why I said yes, but I did. I carried it for a little while and finally ran into someone that worked there and told them what happened. She took it from me. So then I went on, I was going to go back to my room and realized that I had forgotten my room number again. I said, now, this is ridiculous. I have had enough dreams where I have forgotten my room number, that I should be very careful about that when I come to a hotel. So, I went up to the front and I stood in line and I was going to ask them what my room number was. I also thought I didn't have my room number with me so I though I was going to have to ask housekeeping to go up with me and let me in. Then I found my key in my pocket. Obviously it had my room number on it. So I went to the bank of elevators and I just barely caught one. She pointed out what floor numbers is what and I said yes, this is the right one. But then as soon as the door closed and we started to move I realized that it wasn't the right one. It was another of these elevators that move side-to-side instead of up and down. It kind of rolled on these tracks outside of the building. When it stopped I got off. I realized I was in the wrong place but there were no other elevators there for me to get to my room. I was on this thing kind of like a bus but it was just an employee and me. She didn't know how to tell me to get to the elevator that I needed. She finally called someone to come and meet me. As I was waiting there, these tons of people, like a convention. they were all together. I was feeling very uncomfortable in this crowd of people. So I kept moving different places to try to find a good place to stand. Now I think I was driving. And now it seems that I am alone. I was talking to someone on a walkie-talkie. They were trying to give me directions. I was trying to turn around and I pulled up behind this police car. As I did I realized it was a female police office and she was starting to back up. Unfortunately, she didn't see me in time. And then I backed up and turned around and got out and was waiting for this person. I heard someone yelling my name. And so, I got around to her and she took me to the elevator that I needed."
"0294"	"(2001-09-28)"	"I was facilitating one of my dream groups. I counted and there were six or seven people there. I thought Oh good I'm making a decent amount of money tonight."
"0295"	"(2001-09-29)"	"I was at school, I think. I was sharing a bed with Father Nick and Bart H. Not intimately, just sleeping. Bart H slept in the middle. For some reason, one night they were in bed already and I tucked the sheets and blankets in all along my edge of the bed before getting in. I then was having a lot of difficulty getting under the blankets, while they just lay there and watched. Someone else came in the room and said something and then left. Later we were in the airport going home. Actually I think I was in my home airport but it didn't look like it, but several others that I was traveling with were there too, although they aren't from Indy. We were having trouble figuring out where we needed to go. All we kept seeing were restaurants and retail businesses. We went up some escalators and then back down. We finally found out that we needed to go to the ticket counter to get baggage claim tickets. We got in line. There were four of us. I was first in line. When it came my turn they all pushed their way in front of me. I was aggravated by that. At first the ticket counters were very high so you could barely see the people working behind them. When I finally did get to the counter I asked how that had happened and she didn't have an answer for me. While she was taking care of me a group of young girls clamored around the counter pushing me out of the way. Then I got upset again and said something. They felt I was getting upset for no reason but moved a little bit to allow me back to the counter. the counter was the height of a normal airline counter. I left the counter and headed for my car. Oddly I had just one small bag on a portable luggage carrier. I struggled a bit getting the carrier up the escalator. I was in a hurry so I was trying to walk up the escalator rather than just riding it up at it's own pace. I was following a man who was doing the same thing. It felt like someone behind me was watching me critically. It seems that there was more to this dream about steps and escalators but I don't remember the details. I went outside to find my car. It was dark and I couldn't remember where I parked. I wondered if I had written it down on something in my bag but for some reason I was stopping to look. I thought I was fortunate that it wasn't a big parking lot, so I just kept wandering around looking for my car. I encountered a man, maybe two men, in the parking lot who said something to me. just being friendly. The parking lot was on the slant of a hill and there was lots of dirt and grass around. The lot itself was gravel. I woke up before I found the car."
"0296"	"(2001-09-29)"	"I was doing basically the same activity all night. I was doing some kind of work with long tubes. like shipping tubes."
"0297"	"(2001-09-30)"	"I went to the YMCA. there was hardly anyone there. Two men approached me and wanted to talk to me. I wasn't getting my workout done at all. One in particular that I talked to most. His son was there too. I think I left came back. There were a lot of women there. It seems that they were all nuns, women from CIIS, and BJ. One or two of my CRHP sisters were there as I was going in. I had asked this one woman help me to learn how to use the Stairmaster. She wasn't sure how to use it but showed me. She fed this yarn into the Stairmaster because it would do some kind of knitting as you were using it. So she fed this in and it was feeding out this long piece of knitted yarn. It was very irregular and uneven and it came out very fast. I said well, it's very uneven and irregular. It doesn't really matter because it isn't something I want or need anyway. I was still having trouble using the machine. Then I was looking for someone else to teach me how to use it right. There were two machines there. Another woman came over and started showing BJ how to use it while a man was showing me how to use it."
"0298"	"(2001-10-02)"	"I was at a class reunion. I don't remember many of the people that were there. I do remember Susan J, Jake G and Darren. We were sitting in what appeared to be an old house at a large wood oval dining room table. We were just chatting and catching up and were laughing a lot. As more people began showing up we were looking for the other leafs of the table to add in so we could all sit around one table. We thought that everyone who would show up would fit around this one table. We thought that would be really nice to be able to do that. We all started getting up and pulling the table apart. We decided to pull it into another room so we would have room to expand it more. Then we decided to take some of the two-person square tables and put them at the end of this oval table and just keep making it longer and longer by adding those. So we started moving those in. Some of them were a bit taller than others so we tried to keep all those together at the end. As we were putting the square ones next to the oval ones, I was talking to someone and Jake G. We were talking about our little radio or TV program that we had done together. I said something about something that he had messed up. He admitted it. We were kind of laughing about it. I couldn't remember exactly what it was. I said, well, I did too. It wasn't anything critical, just nice memories. I was standing there looking at him thinking that he was as attractive now as ever, except that he was much nicer now. I was looking for a place to sit and I didn't want to sit next to Darren again as I was before we moved the table. It looked like there weren't any seats left. As I was walking around the table looking for a spot to sit, and I wanted to sit next to someone I knew fairly well, I walked behind Susan J and I rubbed her back. I was going to say something and my eyes started tearing. I though dang it, I don't want to cry. This is ridiculous. She looked at me and said what? I said, I wanted to say something but my eyes started tearing up. Several people started laughing. I sat on a ledge behind them. I said, I'm just like my dad. I was kind of joking but I started crying a little bit too. Then I just started laughing uncontrollably. I hid my face trying to compose myself. What I was thinking that I wanted to say was that I had been looking through my old autograph books and I was going to say that I had been doing that and I found something that she had written. I was very touched by it and that is what was making me want to cry."
"0299"	"(2001-10-03)"	"I was sharing a bedroom and a bed, though not intimately, with Darren again. But we had not been intimate. We were trying to go to sleep. He kept rubbing up against me and I kept get irritated. He got upset. I said, Oh, Darren, I'm just PMS'ing. He rolled over and then he brushed up against me again. This time I got really upset and said Darren, will you please quit touching me? So he got mad and got out of bed and was pacing around. He was saying that this just couldn't keep going like this. I was noticing that the room was really a mess because he was so messy. I finally got out of bed and said, you're right. This can't keep going like this. I knew this wasn't going to work. We just need to end this. We are at some kind of family gathering with his family. We are looking through some pictures. I don't think we had told them yet that we were going to divorce again, or divorce, I don't' know. We were looking at pictures. There were some pictures with me in them. There were some other people there besides just his family. I found some pictures in there of Shirley J when she was a baby and I started pulling those out and showing them to Shirley J and kind of detracting people's attention I guess is what I was trying to do. I finally pulled out a couple of pictures of me. I guess we were supposed to be picking out a couple of pictures of me for some reason. I pulled a couple out finally and passed them around. There was one that a couple of people said they really liked and I just shook my head no. I said I just hate pictures of my self. They said oh, people usually do, but these are really good. Matt O. was there. I can't get back what he was doing there. Shirley J was asking if Darren and I were both at her house with her open windows if we would be able to keep an eye out for someone looking in. I said, Shirley J, that would be next to impossible with all the windows you have in that house. She said, yeah, she knew it would be pretty difficult and she probably needed to think about getting something to cover the windows. We talked about that a little bit. About how expensive that would be to cover all those windows. And She has so many patio doors in that house. I said one thing you could do that would be really inexpensive is what I did in my office. I just used a sheet. She looked at me quizzically. I said I just folded the sheet in half lengthwise and used thumbtacks and put it up there. She said that must have been a really long window. I said the sheet hangs behind the desk so you can't see how long the sheet is. Besides, that would be a really easy thing to hem up. I said, the other thing you could do is a rod pocket. She didn't know what I meant by that. So I went to one window where she did have a curtain hanging. I said, just like this. Just take the rod like this and feed it through one end of the sheet and just hanging it that way. I said it would be a little more expensive because you would need to buy curtain rods. And you would still need the sheets. But it would look a little better than hanging it with thumbtacks. When I was pointing to the rod there was no curtain on it, just the rod. And either Daddy or Bill F or someone did something at the other end and made the rod come loose and then it wouldn't go back right. They weren't helping me to get it back right so I was trying to do it myself. I finally got it back. Darren came up and did something. The next thing I know there is this table and the rod had come all apart and there were all of these screws and pieces and the rod had fallen apart. I was so aggravated that someone had done that. We were going to put it back together. I said, first we have to separate all these out by size so we know what goes where."
"0300"	"(2001-10-04)"	"In the center of the mall they had these elaborate Christmas displays. This one woman went, inside one of them were her children. One of her daughters broke a ceramic doll and she was very upset and saying something like what did I do or what can I do. The next thing I knew the mother told her that she needed paint this line down the center of the mall to make up for what she did. She had this colored paint and a very thin artist brush. She was painting this very thin line down the center of the mall. I continued walking around trying to figure out where I needed to go to get to. I was looking for maybe the Van Maur store. I thought maybe that is where I needed to go to find my car. I kept walking back and forth trying to figure out how to get there. This man was out in the mall, working. I'm trying to remember what he was doing. I talked to him and I recognized his voice. He was talking into a microphone but talking to me at the same time. I finally said, oh, Jerry Curtis. He looked at me like I had it wrong. Then he said, Never and he told me his name. I said oh, you're on in the evening. I am so sorry. I listen to you all the time. He smiled at me and kept talking on his microphone. He shook my hand. I said I listen to you while I study. He kind of made this joking, funny face, like while you study? I finally made my way, well as I was trying to make my way to the parking garage I ran into some other people who were also headed for their car. They didn't know where they were parked either. We were talking about how we were supposed to find our cars around this mall and how this mall should do something to make it easier for people to remember where they parked and to find their car. I went outside and there was one couple and another woman. The one couple went out into the parking lot and came back. They were arguing. This other woman didn't have a clue where to begin to look for our cars. we are in kind of a tram. We're watching these kids play some kind of sport that I had never seen before. I asked someone what it was. They answered me but I didn't understand what they said. I was sitting in the second row with another woman and a couple of kids. The tram stopped so the kids could get out and get in the front row with their friends. We were watching this game. It was like there were two rows of deep ruts in the grass."
"0301"	"(2001-10-04)"	"I was outside in the rain trying to walk along the buildings to stay out of the rain. I was going from section to section of parking lot and tried to get to the parking lot where my car was. "

"0304"	"(2001-10-04)"	"I came into a store and both sides of the aisle were lined with fans. The shelves were full of fans. There was a teenage boy working there. I laid my purse down on one of the shelves and headed into the back room. Now it was a bakery. I think it started out as just me, but then it was two other women and me. We were climbing around on top of these huge piles of boxes. It didn't seem like boxes though because we weren't hurting them and in some places it was kind of soft like they were cushions. I don't know how to describe it. It didn't seem that we were climbing around on boxes of baked goods at this point. And we were up there because we were supposed to be to do our jobs. One employee came up to me with this basket of bath and shower products. She asked me if I had tried these different things. She pulled one out and was rubbing it into my arms. Then she pulled out another one and I said no again. I said why don't you try that one on my legs. Then she pulled out another one and asked me if I have tried it. I say no again. She put that one on my back. She straddled me to rub it into my back. There were some kind of metal things coming down from the ceiling. Something about murder. She kept trying different things and I kept saying no. And one hurt and I said, no, no. That hurt. Then we heard an alarm or something and they said, oh, it's time for the kids. They are supposed to be here at 6:00. We all started jumping down to the floor. Started dropping all these toys that were kind of like stuffed animals but not really. They were just really soft toys. So we're picking up the toys and tossing them to the children as they come in. After all the children were in we started playing with them. Now, all these toys had pull cords and would say different things. Most of them were animals now and looked like typical stuffed animals, like a polar bear. rhinoceros. They were all lying on their stomachs. When the store was still a bakery, we were sneaking pieces of pies and cake. We weren't supposed to take anything home with us. I dropped a partially eaten pie into an empty box. That was somebody else's. There were two or three different boxes or bags like that. I was going to sneak them out of the store. When I was doing that a manager came along and he was looking for something and I thought I was going to get caught. He moved the boxes and didn't see what was in them and then he moved them back into the trash pile. I picked them up and took them out with me. He saw me."
"0305"	"(2001-10-14)"	"I was extremely angry. I was with Matthew and two of his friends. I'd been working for Liz C. I was somehow responsible for some money. She was going to have a co-worker threaten to kill me, to test me, and see if I would give up the money. "
"0306"	"(2001-10-15)"	"I was on a TV show like Real People. I was hoping that for the next gig, I would get voted by the producers to go, because I knew that everyone would get to go. The men especially seemed to enjoy having me around. This place that we were staying was awesome. It was four floors and no elevators. But there is no way to describe it. So unusual. So awesome. I was cleaning up the kitchen and complaining because not enough people clean up the kitchen. The men came in and were all dressed up, they looked kind of like tuxes. Some of them had gold pants on. Some of them had black tuxedo pants. A couple of them weren't dressed yet and I went to get my camera so I could take a picture of them all dressed up. They told me I could take a picture afterwards. One of the men didn't have any pants. I went upstairs and I called down. the middle of the building was open from the first floor to the fourth. I called down and told him to come up. Several of them came up. They were laughing and telling me that it was just a joke and they were just teasing me. I got kind of mad at them but they apologized. We went back downstairs and they all took off and told me I could take a picture when they got back. When they got back they weren't dressed up anymore so I didn't get to take my picture anyway. There was one part of this house that was like a huge circular theater. It was so awesome. I can't possibly describe it and do it justice. The seats and decor was mostly red. Behind the last row of seats were all of these Christmas displays. It was soooo cool. There were many different alcoves with arched tops and lit inside and each one had a Christmas display. They wanted me to fix it all up and make it usable again so people would come in and use it again and appreciate it again. Some moving men came. There were these big things, taller than me, flat, magnetic, looked like toy soldiers maybe. These moving men came to pick all these things up and move them somewhere. I was helping them get these things loaded up on their truck. After they left there was quite a bit of extra space. Santa Claus and his wife came in and gave this to me. It was so incredible. They wanted me to fix it up. Mr. and Mrs. Claus and another couple were being lifted into the sky to heaven. It was like they had died but they didn't have to have the typical funeral and everything. They were just being lifted into heaven. Someone came up to me and I said they died and they didn't believe me. I told them what had happened and that this space had been given to me. We started rushing around looking at all the displays and looking at all the neat stuff. In one of the alcoves, Santa had told me he wanted me to set it up kind of like an electric train village. We were looking at all these things and talking about how to move these things around and display them. I was so excited I couldn't wait to get started. Then there was this huge old-fashioned pipe organ that I was playing. All the people I was living with were there. There was some kind of a concert or something going on. I read a poem that I wrote. There was a female singer. We had several women all dressed like her standing in different places and we would put the spotlight on them one at a time so it looked like she was magically moving from one place to the next. It was a soft green spotlight. At one point it was me. I was lying on my side on a couple of seats and I just kept rolling over and over. I rolled over some of the men. I was kissing some of them. Some of them were kind of hiding. They were all a lot younger than I was. I brushed my cheek against one of them and told him how soft his skin was. He seemed to really like that. One of them had part of his stomach showing from his shirt and I leaned down and kissed his stomach. I was being a little bit of a tease. Some of them got up and we were dancing. The music was out of control and there were tons of people in there. There was a bunch of black women. One of them was Audrey T. Another said you should have told us not to bring our purses in, and things like this. We finally got all of these people out and got some control back. When Santa first gave me this place I was showing some people around and we were looking at things. Before Santa had left he had pulled some things out of closets like a sleigh full of things and a rocking chair full of things and just different things like that. Some of the men had come back and were showing me their grades and saying that their grades were good enough that they were good choices to help me refurbish this place for having shows, and tours, and letting people see these wonderful Christmas displays."
"0307"	"(2001-10-16)"	"Chris A Charging me $5500. Matthew doing drugs. Daddy asked Chris A what we owed him for towing my car to St. Joe. He said something jokingly and then with a look like I don't know how you are going to react to this he said $5500. He was totally serious. Daddy hesitated, shocked of course, and then said, well, if that's what we owe, then I'll take care of it. I was so upset. I went back to the house with Daddy. Mother was there. BJ was there too. I didn't let her know how upset I was. After she left, I tried to talk to Mother. I was so upset I couldn't speak. I tried but she could hardly hear the words. I told her what had happened. I said if I had known that I never would have had him tow it. That I wouldn't have paid that kind of money to do anything for that car. The car itself isn't even worth a fifth of that. I was so, so upset. Mother just sat and listened sympathetically. There wasn't much either of us could do. I told her that I tried to call Chris A and heard a message that BJ had left for him apologizing to him that Daddy had not offered to pay his gas money. This made me even more furious and I told Mother about that. I left and went to see Matthew at PLU. I walked. I found Matthew sitting, leaning back, on a cement step shaped sitting area. It was a kind of laid back, I don't care about anything I'm cool posture. I asked him how things were going. How classes were going. He said college is very cool but classes aren't going so well. I'm not sure how I got to this but he admitted to doing what he called the experimental drugs. I tried to stay calm and asked him which ones those were. He said sugar, marijuana, and something I didn't recognize. hadn't heard before. I was terribly upset. I crouched down in front of him and begged him not to do it again. I tried to remind him how dangerous it is. He continued with his casual carefree attitude. I asked him if Chris H did them too. He said no. I asked him what Chris H said about him doing them. He said Chris H asked him something like what the high is in it. As we were sitting there I saw Mother and Daddy drive by in a cute, blue convertible. I realized they must be test driving it for me. I pointed it out to Matthew but they were gone by the time he looked. A little bit later they drove by again, this time with the top up but it looked like a hard top now. I pointed them out quickly and he saw them this time. I said something about it being a cute little car. I was so distraught about the drugs that I got up and walked away. Matthew didn't say anything. I came past the campus again as I was walking home and say Mother and Daddy standing there talking to Matthew. At first I was going to walk on by but then decided to go join them. I didn't say anything to Matthew. Mother and Daddy were saying something about what a good young man Matthew is and something else. I wanted to say, this is not the grandson you knew. This is not the grandson that goes to church on Sundays, etc. But I didn't. I got very upset again and just walked away. Mother and Daddy followed me. I was in tears. Again, I couldn't speak. As we were walking away Matthew called out to me Mom, didn't you forget something. I kept walking because this was not the son I knew. Then I heard, Mommie. Mommie. My heart was breaking because of the drugs and because of walking away from my little boy as he called out to me like that. I didn't know what else to do. I fell to the ground in tears and put my hand to my mouth. Mother and Daddy asked me what was wrong. I couldn't speak. One of them finally said, He isn't doing drugs is he? I nodded my head yes. I woke up in tears. "
"0308"	"(2001-10-16)"	"I was sitting in the yard at my birth home with classmates and a male physical education teacher. He was handing out report cards. I looked at mine and noticed that I was first in the class for grades for our football segment. I felt that was an extreme accomplishment. Partially because I hate football and partially because I don't know that I have ever been ranked first in my class for anything. Diane S said that she was second in the class. I didn't say anything to my classmates. I ran into the house where Bob F was in the living room watching TV. I showed him my report card. We were all sitting in the yard of my birth home. I was so excited that my hand was shaking as I pointed to the football ranking. He didn't say anything but simply pulled out his report card to show me that he had ranked first in several of his classes. I was very upset by this-that not only could he recognize and appreciate my accomplishment, but that it was just more of the same. Bob F and BJ always doing better at school than I."
"0309"	"(2001-10-16)"	"I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it. Then we thought we were almost done and we realized the kitchen was still full. In working on emptying the kitchen I noticed all of the things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. I removed some of them but asked others to help with that. I went into the bedroom and began selectively taking things off the walls. I kept the religious items that were there and some of the lighting fixtures/lamps. The only thing in particular that I remember hanging in the kitchen, though I remember there were a lot of things hanging, is a small yarn thing that reminded me of a miniature flower holder that was popular maybe twenty years ago. People were beginning to complain more and more about how hungry they were. I finally decided to go ahead and order pizza. One man pulled a bunch of pizza coupons out of his pocket. They offered two medium pizzas for $9.99. I asked someone to call in an order and just order a variety of different kinds. There were a lot of people there so they needed to figure out how many to order. There were a lot of wicker decorative items. Some of them were basket like in nature and I would put things from the walls in them. Some of the huge wood wall units still had many items sitting on the shelves. We were moving them with the things still in place. I have no idea how those things did not fall off. I was always glad when I could push a piece onto an area rug and move it along with no problem. Some of the things were oddly shaped and we had to figure out how to get them down the L-shaped stairwell. Some were extremely heavy. Some that I thought would be really heavy I would see one or two men hoist above their heads and carry them out. Some large items were so light I could lift them with one hand and push them down the stairs myself, even some of the large, stuffed chairs."
"0310"	"(2001-10-16)"	"He kind of made a pass at me. Then he took me to his bedroom but there were a lot of other people in there. The bedroom was very contemporary. It had many spaces with partitions. Everything has these very curvy lines to it. I don't know how to explain this at all. He chased all the people out. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get them all out. When he did, we realized his wife was there and she was unpacking and talking to him like nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door. Instead of running down the two flights of stairs, I simply jumped over the rail and landed down two flights. I thought I was safe there but she threw something and it hit me. I just kept running."
"0311"	"(2001-10-16)"	"Some men came in and worked in the upstairs bathroom. It was not the normal WNA maintenance men. I didn't even know they were going to do it until after it was done. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an old toilet that was all nasty and rusty around the rim. I was having all kinds of trouble with it overflowing and I couldn't get it to stop. They also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans."
"0312"	"(2001-10-17)"	"I went to a Kroger store to get my prescription for Concerta filled. I was talking to them about it. I told them that I used to work for People's Drug Stores and from that experience I knew that different stores in one chain would have different prices on items depending on their location. I wondered if that was the same for them and their prescriptions. At first he acted like he didn't want to tell me then he kind of nonchalantly acted like he didn't know. I had the feeling that he did know but he didn't want to tell me. I was walking around the store waiting for my prescription to be filled. It was a very small store for a Kroger store. It was more the size of a drug store. They were telling other people that I used to work for People's Drug Stores. They introduced me to one man in particular, but I can't remember why they introduced me to him or who he was or what his role was. My prescription was finally ready and I went to pick it up and it was over $200. I said, Oh, wait a minute. When I came to get it filled the last time it was only $125. Of course, that was a different store. I can't do this. I've been unemployed for the last year. I've been having enough trouble getting this as it is. They took it back. I went to get a bottle of Diet Sprite before I left. I realized I didn't have my purse with me so I put it back on the shelf and went out to my car to get my money. I saw my purse and my car keys laying on the seat and the door was locked. I was so angry. I went back in and they called AAA for me. While I was waiting they were having a company meeting so I just sat with them during their meeting. I kept watching out the window for AAA to arrive. They were going around the tables and talking about each person or having each person say something. I didn't think they would make me speak since I was not a part of their group, and they didn't. They passed by me. I saw AAA come so I ran out quickly. As I got out there I realized that my car keys were in my pocket. And AAA was actually a woman driving a mini-van. When I got out there and realized that I had my keys she was out of the van and lifting the rear door up to get ready to help me. I apologized for having called her out there for nothing. She didn't seem upset, like it wasn't a big deal. She said no, that was fine."
"0313"	"(2001-10-20)"	"I was so excited during this dream as I realized that I was lucid and was sharing this with my family. They didn't know quite what to think. Many of my siblings and in-laws were there with their children. But the children were much younger and not in the same chronological age order, or not represented as such by size, than in waking life. The first time I realized that I was lucid is when Chris A was just a baby and Matthew was about three times his size. I said, Hey, you men this is a dream! They all looked at me kind of funny, not quite sure how to respond. I said you can tell because look at the difference in sizes between Chris A and Matthew. Chris A is significantly older than Matthew is and it should be the other way around. I don't know if we are all having this dream or if it is simply that I am lucid, but this is definitely a lucid dream. We went about what we were doing, changing diapers, working in the kitchen, eating cookies and such. Mari Kate S had curlers in her hair and was very small. Chris A came up to me again but this time he was about 4 times the size he was earlier. I said to everyone Look, another example of this being a dream. Chris A is now 4 times larger than he was a couple of minutes ago! This is so cool!"

"0315"	"(2001-10-26)"	"I was going to work for Brad S and I had taken some hamburger with me to take home after I got off work. I put it in one of the desk drawers hoping that he wouldn't see it before we left. In his office there were two desks. His was sitting facing the door and the other was sitting at an angle facing his. I was sitting at the other desk. I don't remember what I was doing. As usual, there wasn't much to do. There were several people in there. I noticed my desk had stuff all over it just like his usually is in waking life, especially a bunch of pens. I start picking up these pens and testing them. A lot of them didn't write any longer so I threw them away. I thought to myself, why didn't he do that. Someone then asked me the same thing. I was trying to be nice and just said I don't know. He brought some new insurance man in to introduce to me. I was trying to be nice. I don't remember what kind of insurance he was selling. I told him I was satisfied with my current insurance policies. After all those people left, Susan J and Theresa Ay came in. I found that Susan J was working for him part-time and one full day a week and that Theresa Ay was also working for him. I got really angry with him and thought, no wonder I'm not getting any hours. I took my stuff and left. I was going through all these doors and hallways trying to get out. I noticed that Brad S was following me. I kept walking as quickly as I could and taking all of these different turns hoping to lose him. I finally got outside and I started flying right away thinking that was the best way to get away from him. I did. I lost him. Everyone else that was flying was flapping their arms to fly. I kind of turned on my back and was just enjoying how good it felt. Amy S had invited me to a lunch. There were quite a few people there. The attire was dressy. We went to kind of a fancy restaurant but it was a very long table with all of the female friends of hers. She was the only person I knew. All of the things we were eating were kind of colorful molds of things. Some of them were Jell-O molds. Some had mini-marshmallows covering them. I mentioned to her what Brad S had done about the hours and how angry I was that he had done that to me. A couple of people questioned it because I was trying to defend my position then. I stated that when I interviewed I got the impression that we agreed to my working 12 to 4 or 5, Monday through Friday and the weekly hours would be between 20 and 25. I stated that it has never been that way since I started. The first week I got 18 hours, and it has declined each week after that, with last week being only 2 hours. I was getting so angry talking about it. I learned that Susan J and all of these women were part of office services for the building where Brad S rents. One woman left to find out what was going on and she came back and told us that. I said, you know that really doesn't matter to me. It still doesn't make it right that he told me one thing and didn't follow through. I said I'm sure he didn't realize that Susan J and I grew up together and were best friends for a lot of years. I went and talked to Susan J to see if she was in fact doing this specialized stuff that they said she was and if she wasn't then she was basically doing the same thing he had me doing when he did have me come in. At that point different people started showing up and making all kinds of accusations about people. It was getting ugly and embarrassing. Some people were just sitting there because they didn't know what to do or say. I just decided that I was going to leave. Again, it was a series of doors that I had to go through to leave. They were all glass and some of them were revolving doors. I finally managed to get out. My car was sitting right outside the final door. I jumped in and locked the doors so that even if they did follow me they couldn't get in. I started it and put it in gear. I was in a cobblestone courtyard. It was fairly open but it had three places that you could probably drive through. They looked somewhat like alleys. All these women were walking around in floor length pastel flowing dresses and they all had boas. Some of them were bright colors, but they all had boas. I went ahead and put my car in gear. I wondered how I was going to get out with these women walking around everywhere. I managed to make it out with no problem."
"0316"	"(2001-10-26)"	"I'm driving and now I have someone in the car with me. We're trying to get back home. We don't remember the way. It seems as though we are in Norton. We take a couple of turns hoping that we are headed in the right direction. Finally there is a very large African-American woman working on the front door of her house. She had her back to us. I finally decided to pull up anyway and asked her for directions. I just stopped on the road and she turned around. I asked and she gave me directions. She said, well, you're headed in the wrong direction to go to Indy. You need to go back the other way and go to that road and turn right? I didn't know what road she meant. She had turned back around and went back to her work on the door. We were going to turn around and head back, even though we still weren't sure of the directions. For some reason we stopped somewhere and we went inside. Maybe for something to drink. People are looking at us kind of strangely. We asked for directions again and someone points to a pile of papers, like glossy photos, sitting on a table. She said, your answer is in there. So we rushed over there and began going through them. We were lifting them up and laying them down as you would if you wanted to keep them in the right order. They were pictures of movie stars. The person with me knew all their names and she was really good at naming them very quickly. When we got to the bottom it was a wedding. I looked at it and realized it was this friend that was with me. I said look at this. Suddenly we noticed what she was wearing. She was wearing a wedding dress. We finally realized that she had run out of her wedding. So we were walking around this building. There were many rooms. Each one had an altar and a lot of them were decorated similarly. like there might have been a few basic themes that they used. One of them was like a flower arrangement sitting on some goblets and there was water flowing, kind of like a table top water fountain. I finally said, we have got to go. We have got to get out of here. We finally found this one room and there were people that we knew in there and people that knew she had run away and left her fiance at the altar. We were talking about how hungry we were. This one woman came up who had baked the cake. She was so sad and distraught because no one was going to enjoy her cake. She had made some other cakes for dessert as well. For some reason she said we could taste them as long as we didn't cut into them. Like we could taste, we should take some of the decorations off the top to taste. I asked her where the wedding cake was and told her I really wanted to see it. She took us to see it. It was three squares like Mother and Daddy's. She said, but don't touch the wedding cake. So, a couple of us lifted icing decorations off these smaller cakes and were eating those. Someone took them off the wedding cake also and was eating those. Then I realized that someone had actually cut into the cakes. We were picking up pieces of those cakes and eating them. Some of them were ice cream cakes. The fiance didn't seem to be very upset when he saw this. He was crouched down next to another woman at a table and talking to her. I with this friend of mine, who was the bride-to-be, to talk to them a bit. He didn't seem to be upset with her or anything. I told my friend that I thought he was attractive and asked her if she would mind if I went out with him. She said, no, that was fine but that I would have to wait because it would be improper for me to approach him right away. As we were walking away I commented on how nice he was and she agreed. We were both surprised that he was handling this so well."
"0317"	"(2001-10-27)"	"All night long these different computer tasks were going through my head, making choices from the menus. Fixing problems, etc. Very annoying."
"0318"	"(2001-10-27)"	"I get the feeling that I was at my birth home but the people there were people from CIIS and from the sleep center. We got word that this famous shoe designer was going to be there and was going to give us each a pair of shoes. When it was almost time for us to go in this room where she set up there was a lot of. Someone said there was no line so everyone was just kind of milling around. Then a couple of people started to form a line, so I got in that line quickly. A couple more people followed and so on. Someone else started another line so I moved over to that line and everyone followed. When they opened the door and let us in. At first they just let a couple of people in so I was one of those first few to go in. At first I thought there were just a couple of styles and all in white. I never wear white shoes. Then I realized the whole room was almost wall to wall shoes and several shelves high, different colors. White, pink, beige, navy, and black. There were some that had multi-colored gemstones and flowers and looked very gaudy to me. I couldn't decide and I was going around and around and around in this room. I suddenly realized that everyone else had chosen theirs and I still had not. While I was in there, Gill U came in. I wondered what he was doing there. I thought, why won't he leave me alone. I said hello and asked him what he was doing there. I told him this was a special event just for our company employees. He kind of blew it off a little bit and continued walking around. He said something but I don't remember what. Then he left. I noticed Doctor W and his wife were there. I didn't say anything to them. I pretended not to see them there. They didn't say anything to me so I don't know if they were doing the same thing or if they really didn't see me. Julie S came up to me. I was looking at one pair in particular. She said I see that you have the same taste in shoes as I do. I said, yes I do. As it was winding up the designer was there and said something to me. I told her what I was looking for but that I hadn't found it in my size. There was one style, pink and flat heels, that was called the president or presidential. I just noticed a couple more boxes of those that I hadn't seen previously so I quickly looked to see if my size was there, but it wasn't. So her and her employees were starting to pack up. I kept walking around the room and there were these other things that she had made and were hanging from peg hooks. Some of them were dream catchers. Someone said something about the dreamcatchers. I agreed that they were beautiful and told them that I do dreamwork. They said, really, you interpret dreams? I said, I help people interpret dreams. I said, I have a collection of dreamcatchers on my office wall at home. Some of the things hanging from the peg hooks I don't know what they were and am at a loss to even describe them. maybe similar to necklaces but I don't think that's what they were. We were sitting back in the living room. Karen M was sitting there and wanted to see what shoes I had chosen, but I didn't get any. I had come out with some things in my arms though. They must have been scarves. The designer had given me those in place of shoes. I told Karen M I didn't get any shoes and asked her what she got. She was showing me the things that she got. She had some candles and decorative items but I don't know if she got shoes either."
"0319"	"(2001-10-27)"	"There was something about me taking my car to get it looked at or get an estimate or semi-fixed. I went back to the house but I didn't want to go to work. I told Mother and Daddy that I didn't feel well and I wasn't going to work. I knew I was lying but I didn't think they did. I realized I would need to act sick now so they wouldn't say anything. We were watching TV. There was more about my car but I can't remember it now."
"0320"	"(2001-10-27)"	"I went to see Alice S to ask her a couple of questions. I can't get a sense of the building I was in. Normally I would be either in the grade school, church offices, or in Shalom House. This was more like a very large, 3-4 story school or. It reminds me of Goodman Hall at SMW. I went into Alice S's office. It was very tiny and uncomfortable to me because it was so small and crowded. It had her desk and some shelves and filing cabinets, two sitting chairs with a table between them and another very small desk also. Alice S was in there. I had asked her something and she was printing a copy or getting a paper for me or for someone else. I'm not sure. The gentleman that works in her office at that very small desk was working at his laptop computer. His name was Scott. He closed it up and left. For some reason I had the sense that he wasn't going to be working there anymore. I asked Alice S what happened to Scott. She said, shh, like we shouldn't talk about it. I sat down in one of the chairs while I was waiting for her. She sat down at her desk and another man came in and started talking to her. He completely ignored me or didn't even see me there. He was standing right in front of me with his back to me and started asking her something. Then he left and a woman came in and actually closed the door behind her. She said, hi boss. Can I have ten minutes of your time? This was an older woman. She looked at me but completely ignored me and didn't say a word to me. Finally Alice S looked at me apologetically and said, would you mind? I said, why don't you give me one of your cards and I'll email you. My tone of voice showed my frustration. I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me. I just chalked it up to him being either very busy or in one of his moods. Either way this is how he would have acted so I didn't take it personally."
"0321"	"(2001-10-31)"	"I was with my family in St. Joe. I was thinking that it would be fun for us to all go to a professional baseball game together. Not sit all in one row but several rows, one in front of the other, so we can talk together more. The next thing I know we are there. I'm not sure who all was there but it was at least my parents and my siblings and I. I wanted something to eat and drink but no one else was so I wouldn't say anything. I took some money, a ten-dollar bill, out of my wallet, folded it up and put it in my shoe. Someone said something about it. I said I forgot to do it earlier and I don't usually put it in my shoe but that was easiest right now. We were referring to the fact that you are supposed to put money, like a one-dollar bill, on your person all the time for luck. I think I actually got the money out because I was hungry. A bit letter I noticed others eating and drinking and I was aggravated because no one offered to have me go with them or offered to get me anything. Brian F was eating potato wedges and drinking a coke. Later I noticed others had gone and gotten things too. Still later Brian F was now eating a cheeseburger and drinking a coke. BJ asked if I wanted to get some ice cream and I said no, I really didn't want ice cream. What I really wanted was the potato wedges and a sprite. While we were watching the game I was almost hit a couple of times by fly balls. I also noticed that in between the sections of the stands there were these very tall, white, plastic, flexible holders that were taller than the stands and they each held a golf ball at the end. The golf ball could be released and thrown somewhere. It had some purpose for the game. I thought it was very unusual. I was walking around with Brian F and BJ and we were talking about people writing and talking about the end of the war. I was thinking that if I had initiated this conversation a year ago they would have dismissed me and not paid any attention. Now BJ had heard this from someone else and was very intrigued and ready to discuss it. I recognized that things seem to come around to their geographic areas a year or so later than here. Kind of like the time lapse between New York and California fashions hitting other parts of the country. Anyway, we were talking about this one series of books, I believe they were written about The Rapture. Two of the women I worked with last year were really into them but I didn't read them because they didn't sound like they coincided with my beliefs. Anyway, BJ was very intrigued by the whole idea and Brian F was just listening with interest and as though he wanted to learn and understand. typical for Brian F. I remember saying something about this books talking about the world opening up and swallowing people and fires etc. I reminded them that they are still written by men, as was the Bible, and as were Conversations with God, by Neale Donald Walsh. I went on to say that it is impossible for us to know these things for certain. That even though these people claim to be writing from God's inspiration, they are still human men and fallible. I went on to say that we each need to find our own truth. we left the ball game and went to another place. I don't know what the place was. It was a semi-circle theater. The round stage was completely dark except for a spotlight on the man speaking. The back half of the round stage had individual dark curtains. Each curtain had the name of a place in lights. One of them was Lesourdesville Lake Amusement Park. We chose that curtain. Immediately we were transported to another place. I thought it was going to be Lesourdesville Lake but it wasn't. This is difficult to describe. It looked as though we were watching a movie scanning the night skyline of a large city, but at the same time it felt as though we were there. not physically flying and not in an airplane. which is why it is difficult to describe that part. But now it is suddenly daytime and we fly past the World Trade Center towers and they are on fire and smoking. I realize where we are and when and I become very upset and fight back tears. we are on a boat and it begins to burn. It quickly docks and people begin to get off. No one is panicking and I get off safely. There was a coral colored carpet and I had to go up several steps to get off, but it was almost mazelike. I had to go up a step, walk to one side for a little while and find an opening to go up the next step. There was one woman in particular with long sandy-brown hair. I don't know who she is but we said something to each other as we were leaving. we are back in the theater. My family members are all in seats. I am approaching them with a notepad in hand. I see the Homers sitting there as well. Kenny H is sitting on the end of the row. I sit down on the floor next to him to ask him about this experience. I am thinking that I am sure that I am still dreaming. I asked Kenny about his experience. He said they did in fact go where their curtain said they were going. He said they were awake in coming to the theater and they were awake now. I was disappointed to hear that because I was so sure to that point that I was still dreaming. I was writing feverishly to get everything down on a notepad. Some people came up behind us and set up a table and sat down there. They seemed to be upper-class people. My paper was making noise as I turned the pages and they were getting very annoyed. I was having trouble finding a clean sheet of paper but did not want to stop for fear of losing some of this. Matthew came up to me. He is a much younger boy, maybe 9 or 10. I was trying to gather all of my things to go and sit with him. I had lots of papers, a drink, and a winter coat. I was having trouble getting it all. Matthew helped. As we were walking to our seats we passed Darren. He said that Matthew had said he would visit with Darren after this. I was aggravated by this and said I would have talk to Matthew about this and we would see. We went to our seats."
"0322"	"(2001-11-04)"	"I was with Mike M, but he did not look like he does in waking life. He was taller, a bit younger looking and very attractive. We were practically running through a mall because it was almost time for a movie to start. We were going to see K-Pax. He had my hand and was practically pulling me along telling me to hurry. I finally let go of his hand and let him go on ahead. I think we made it in time though I don't remember for sure. I was with Mike M again but this time he looked different. We were at my home but it looked like my birth home. At some point I had woken up, in the dream not from the dream, and realized that he had moved in with me while I was sleeping. He was concerned about me because of my life situation lately and how I have been feeling as a result, particularly that I have been sleeping too much. He came in and sat on the bed by my side and was trying to help me wake up and encouraging me to get out of bed. I got up and headed for the bathroom. He had gone shopping and bought tons of stuff that was sitting everywhere. There was barely a path to walk through the house and patio. There was a lot of frozen food that I wondered why he hadn't put it in a freezer but realized it would never fit in my small freezer. I don't even know what all of the other stuff was. There were some decorative items and some kitchenware. I went outside and many of my relatives on my mother's side of the family were there. I know Larry K, Bruce W, and Sue K were there, they were making comments about Mike M and all of these things that he purchased. BJ came up to me and offered me some yellow gum. It was a small roll and she broke a piece off and gave it to me. She said Mike M had given it to her for her breath. I felt bad and apologized but told her that he had a lot of very fine qualities and that he truly is a wonderful man."

"0324"	"(2001-11-06)"	"The characters were like little plastic toys but they were real/alive. This couple decided that they really needed a vacation so they decided to take off and I think they were just going out to do something fun for the day. It was as though there were two of the wife. It wasn't two separate women but two of the same woman. They went and got into their little toy car and were going to leave. Now just one of the wives was in the car. They were having trouble getting out of their garage. I helped them somehow. It was as if I was playing with toys because I bent over and reached down and helped them. Some of the neighbors came out after them. They were angry with them. They drove their car up a set of stairs. They were running back into their apartment to get away from someone. Now real people were inside an apartment. There were two people sitting in old-fashioned bathtubs full of water. One really large man came in. He is one that they had been trying to get away from. He had nothing on but shorts/boxers/swimming trunks. I came up behind him and grabbed his ankles and made him fall head first into one of the tubs. The person sitting in the tub held the man's head beneath the water until he drowned."
"0325"	"(2001-11-07)"	"I went for a walk with Amy S and someone else on the Main trail. We were walking to a bank. Amy had an interview and when we came back we came to this cornfield that had a maze cut in it. We were discussing whether or not to cut through the fields through the maze or to go the way we know. I said it was so close to dark that I was concerned that we would not be able to find our way in the dark. They finally agreed and we cut straight across the way we had come. We ran into Barb M. We are standing and talking to her only now it seems just me. I asked her if she had ever been on the Main trail and she said no. She is standing with me and looking at a bunch of necklaces. I don't know where they are coming from. I think we are outside. It looks like various. I'm not sure how to describe them. Two of them were very long colored beads. Barb had never been on the Main and didn't even know where it was. I told her I would take her and add a little heart to her day. I did. We got separated. I don't know if she got lost or not. I see her in her car and she is headed back to CI but she is driving on the Main. I waved to her to come back and she does. We tell her that she can't drive on the Main that it is for pedestrians and bicyclists only. I am at Brad S and Amy's house for dinner. We are talking. Amy had invited Darren and Matthew and this other man. This other man wasn't there with his wife. We talked and had a good time. Of course I stayed away from Darren. I went and found Marshall E and I went and found Amy and asked her what was going on. why she had invited Darren. I don't remember her answer. I tried to resolve to be as pleasant as possible. I had talked a little bit to this other man that she had invited. He wanted to know what I was doing. I said basically nothing except being a full-time student because I was too embarrassed to talk about my part-time jobs when I am working on a Ph.D. We sat down to have dinner and this other man is playing with my foot under the table. I got Amy by herself and asked her what was going on. Somehow I knew this man was married but I don't remember now how. She said that yes he is married but that he only sees Shannon on weekends and I don't know how that is going anyway. I said but I don't want to be the reason anyone's marriage breaks up. I said I could not live with that."
"0326"	"(2001-11-11)"	"Nick R was with two other women. They were having sex but it was also very rough and they were hurting each other and causing cuts and scratches or something that was causing them to bleed."
"0327"	"(2001-11-24)"	"I was on my go-cart/bicycle/car. I will call it my car from here because that is what I was calling it in the dream. I was going to St. Joe. I picked up several of my relatives on the Harris side of the family. Allen was one of them but I don't remember who the others were. They got on behind me like they were one behind the other as if on a motorcycle. We were going for a drive but I don't remember where we were headed. I was going up a hill and I was having difficulty getting up the hill. Uncle H used his feet to help us get up this hill. I am sitting in Doctor Da' office. Mother and Daddy were there with me. I had an 8 am appointment. Doctor Da is a dentist. We sat there. We kept waiting and waiting all day long until almost 4 pm. I finally asked while we were still waiting and he said that he didn't show that we had an appointment. I said I had just made the appointment two months ago and that I had made it for first thing in the morning so the rest of the day I could have free. I was upset because I had now lost the whole day. He didn't even apologize. He just said that I didn't have an appointment and it wasn't in his books. He didn't have anything computerized. He just had a paper appointment book. I thought it might be the receptionist fault. that perhaps she didn't write it down in the book when we spoke. He asked me if I had a specific problem and I said that I did. I've had this tooth that I lost a filling and it's been bothering me for a long time. He said I could schedule another appointment. When I scheduled the last time the soonest I could get in was two months later and now I was going to have to wait another two months. I was very upset because Mother and Daddy thought that I had screwed up. They thought that maybe I had written it down wrong. Then there was some discussion about my taking the relatives for a ride in my car and how inappropriate that was. Matthew was with us and so was Bill F. Someone from Doctor Da' office had borrowed some audio books or videos. First it was just one and she brought it out and gave it back to me, but later she came back with 3 or 4 more. I noticed that they were all still in their cellophane wrappers which meant they had not even watched them or listened to them. They were still brand new. I finally decided to go ahead and leave. I had some other things too. Bill F was driving a pick-up truck so I put my things in the back of the truck and told Bill F to go ahead and take Matthew back and I would just go ahead and drive my car back MYSELF. No one HAS to ride with ME."
"0328"	"(2001-11-25)"	"Shortly after connecting with this man and after a phone conversation with Matthew I said I really needed to get more serious about joining the YMCA, knowing how much better I'll feel after I do. I just got done talking on the phone with Matthew and after I finished talking on the phone with this man I immediately drove to PLU to see Matthew. He was having some problems with his skin. He had this red blotchy. something. all over his skin. He was somewhat successful cooling it with some hand lotion he found at the YMCA. I did kind of the same thing as soon as I heard what they were saying. I went and took a hot shower and felt so much better instead of the lotion. But I noticed in a mirror that it was all red splotches, like hives. We discussed calling an ambulance but for whatever reason we didn't. And then, uh, first thing I. is when some of them did and the next day was Christmas."

"0330"	"(2001-11-25)"	"I was in the city where I live. I stopped by Petsmart to buy something to send to ground zero for the dogs there. It was $2.33. Petsmart said they collect things that people want to send there and that they send the shipments every few days. I could just pay for it and they would ship it. When she rang up the sale she didn't take my money. She said, no, we'll take care of it. Yet, she had rung it up on the register and she left the register open. I gave it to her and I left. For some reason I went back in and some woman was talking about something that happened to her and she said something about the Grace of God. I said, I think everyone has a little bit of the Grace of God in them. I was talking to her and one other woman then I realized that one of the store managers had overheard me. I went ahead and was pushing a cart for someone reason. I turned the cart around in a very tight space and I had two things in my arms, like a binder and a pair of shoes and something else. Odd for being a pet store. But they were my things. I put the cart back and went outside. It was raining a little bit and I rushed to get in my car. It was dark then. I am trying to get out of this parking lot and it is no longer raining and no longer dark. There are all these chain link fences. high. and they are kind of like a maze and I am having trouble getting out. I don't even remember how I got in through this. There were a couple of places that I thought I could get out but I was afraid to try because it was such a narrow opening. This one place I tried. It was at an angle but I caught the car on a wire or something as I went through and it snapped. I was worried that I had damaged the car. As soon as I went through I realized I couldn't get out from there so I had to go back the way I came. I had to really, really maneuver the car around so I could get it at the right angle so I could get through and I was worried about getting caught on that wire again. I did get through but there were like two or three wires. One was stuck to the front of the car but it kept stretching as I went through and it finally snapped around. Again I was afraid I had damaged the car. Then I realized that someone had parked their car previously and now it was gone so that gave me an opening to get out. So I went out this way. Then the pavement was almost like these really large cement. rough. rocks. It was really rough driving on them. I thought if I damage my car Daddy is going to think I was careless and I will need to reassure him that I have been trying to be very careful. That I've learned to be very careful not to damage my car by being careless. I finally got to a smooth road and I was trying to figure out how to get back home from where I was. I was on W. 56th St. I realized I had to go up this hill and now, instead of my regular car that I have in waking life, I know I was driving a VW bug but it was without the shell and a one-person vehicle. It was almost like, at least partially, it went under my own power. Maybe bicycle pedals. I had to go up this hill. I was having trouble getting up the hill. getting enough speed or power. I was talking to someone else or someone was commenting on it was a VW bug. I don't know. This part is very sketchy and makes absolutely no sense to me. It's like I'm still traveling through the streets. I had to go through part of downtown Indy. At the same time as I am going through downtown, it is as though someone is interviewing this small group of people. Three of them were male dressed in black for lack of a better word I will call them vigilantes but they were men who tried to fight crime in our city. They were talking about what they would have done and how they would have been prepared. I thought they were talking about the 911 attack. They said they would have known ahead of time and they would have been on walkie-talkies and would have cut the kids off at the pass and warned the teacher, etc. I am driving along the street and the one man is talking to a woman, girlfriend maybe, in his group, by cell phone. She is sitting on a step outside the building, saying I told you that you could leave me out of it and you said no you wanted me in it and now you're telling me that you don't need me. She was just a little perturbed. She wasn't really mad at him. Just a little perturbed by it. I'm finding at this point I need to grab the edge of the buildings and pull myself to keep myself moving forward."

"0332"	"(2001-11-27)"	"Kendall B came to visit but we were once again at my birth home. Mother and Daddy were there. He was very out-going. Shortly after he arrived he took all of his clothes off because he liked to be naked around the house. We were going to sit and talk about my dissertation but we kept getting interrupted. There were a lot of people around and a lot of commotion. I finally asked him if he would mind going downstairs to sit and talk. He said that was fine with him. We went through the kitchen and he opened up some of the kitchen cabinets looking for something sweet to eat. He found a couple of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed those on the way down. We went downstairs and there were people down there too. I think Bev and I'm not sure who else. So we were being distracted there too. I kept having difficulty getting other people to leave us along so we could actually have a discussion. I think I went back upstairs once or twice looking for more of my notes or materials. I did convince him to put some clothes on because it was making my parents uncomfortable. It started out that he just flew in for the day and then he was going to fly back out that night. But with all the people and commotion I was concerned that we weren't going to be finished in time. He said that really wasn't a problem at all. He ended up going to spend the night in a hotel I think. I just had this image of opening this hotel room and it was. you could barely open the door, like something was sitting behind it. So I was trying to open the door far enough to somehow push that out of the way so I could open the door all the way. I also remember those doorways were very low and Kendall B was going to have to bend over to come down this hall and get in the door to his hotel room. Something about two of his children."
"0333"	"(2001-11-27)"	"I went back to work as a store manager for SFI but I took over Pam T's store. It was such a mess. You could hardly walk into the backroom. There was merchandise everywhere and all kinds of odd things too, like little Christmas statues/knick knacks and decorations. Plastic containers and lots and lots of clothes. It was a mess!! After the first few days I had a very brief informal store meeting telling the staff what to expect over the next few weeks and over the next year. I told them what I had done at the previous store and what I would be doing and what I expected from them. One or two of the employees arrived late. We had forgotten to lock the door after all the employees got there. We had customers wandering in and we had to get them back we had to apologize. Some of them were a bit upset. We went back to our meeting. I told them I was going to be spending my time initially, getting the backroom in order and that I would expect them to take care of the sales floor. keep it neat and clean and orderly. Take care of the customers. Be very sales oriented, etc. When we left we went out through the back door. It was pitch black dark. You couldn't see anything. They tried to show me where the store key was hidden outside the store. I was comparing this to where we hid the key at the other store. In waking life we didn't do such a thing. I also talked about how dark it was and asked them if they normally bring flashlights. They said no they just deal with it. I made a mental note that I had to talk to Lisa S about that. On another day during business hours I went up to one of the employees and instructed her on recovery. She didn't seem really offended by my instruction. She asked a couple of questions and then got started. I also made a comment to all of the staff that I like to make surprise visits when I am not scheduled to work and that I had better never find a boyfriend or spouse visiting during working hours. There was a boyfriend visiting at that time so I went up to him and told him that he needed to go and the employee said she understood. He kind of wandered around and pretended to be shopping. I noticed this when I was instructing the other employee on how to recover the racks. Lisa S came for a visit. When she did I had the backroom in much better order. She didn't seem that interested. I didn't get the reaction from her that I wanted. She was pleased and certainly noticed the improvements. I said doesn't it look great? And she said yes. I said there is just so much merchandise back here. It was folded up on shelves. It was a long narrow backroom. She said yes but this store had gotten merchandise that a lot of the other stores did not get and that's why all the unusual stuff. We would be selling through most of this stuff over the winter season. We had both been working in the store and were exhausted and we just kind of collapsed for a little bit. There was an area where Lisa S actually laid down. I said, okay Lisa S it's time to exercise now. I turned on some exercise music and I started exercising. She said no way and finally did get up and moving and exercising. I also said something to her about that light and it being so dark outside the door at closing. She said that was up to the landlord. I said something really has to be done because it would be much less expensive for them to do something about it now then to deal with a lawsuit if something happens to an employee because of the lack of light. I was giving some employees something to sign. In the place that I sign I wrote Kroger instead of SFI. One employee was talking about how the recent changes I had implemented in the store were spilling over into the rest of her life and made some very positive changes."
"0334"	"(2001-11-27)"	"They started fighting over me. They were in a sailboat race together. It was very exciting for them and they won. Afterwards they were totally exhausted and cold. I was sitting in a chair and holding one on each side of me trying to help them warm up and letting them rest and getting their rest back. I don't know what happened from there. I got up to leave and their father, Eddie Arnold, came out of his bedroom. I saw five other men in there with him. A couple of them saw me and kind of made a pass at me. His first wife had died. The younger sister was feeling very lonely and wanted attention. I soon realized that's what both girls wanted. They just wanted all the attention and they didn't give any attention back. The girls had a younger brother and they wanted me to help them keep him out of the room. There were two doors that he could get into and they were side by side. I was trying to hold both doors closed against his efforts. I was trying to find something within my reach that I could block the door with, like a doorstop. I couldn't find anything. The younger sister, I think her name was Sandy [unknown in waking life] , kept handing me things. She didn't understand what I was looking for and kept handing me things that weren't going to work. Then I saw that the older sister had a collection of things on the wall and a couple of them were doorstops. One of them had a teddy bear face with little foam pieces that were the facial features. They were on the part that you would stick under the door. So I took the ears and stuff off so I could put it under the door. I knew I could glue them back on when I was done with it. I put it under the door but then it morphed and was no longer a doorstop so it didn't work. I had torn it apart for nothing. I suggested newspaper but that didn't work because he just pulled it right through the door. I tried various things and I ended up having to just sit there and hold the door closed as the girls had wished. I'm thinking the older girl's name was Sharon. Sharon had morphed and was now very small. Her legs had become the size of a Barbie doll. I treated Sandy like a little sister. She had these things out in the hall that were making a lot of noise. I was concerned about bothering the neighbors and convinced her to bring them in. Actually at this point she morphed into a young child. Then I heard someone else in the hallway that was making just as much if not more noise. I asked her what that was and she told me. I told her that was going to have to come in too. She got very sad so I asked her to explain to me what it was. She had these metal pails with water in them and something attached to them that was making all the noise. She would set the water in the hallway on the heat vents. She said that it helped return more water to the land. I asked her if it would work if we took the noisy part off. I said if we just set the pails on the heat vents the water will still return to the land. So that satisfied her and we did that. I went back out in the hall a couple minutes later and the maintenance man was out there. He was upset because the water was sitting there. I explained to him with her standing there what it was for. He really softened and became kind and said that was fine and we could leave them there. Everyone was happy now and we went back into the apartment. I guess sometime along here I had let the little boy back in and he was in his bedroom. I went in and talked to him a little bit and patched things up and made our relationship okay. I was commenting to Sharon on how nice it was to be sleeping with all these people. She looked at me funny and I laughed and I said I just meant having so many family members and loved ones in the house and around you. I said it's just a really nice feeling. She just smiled at me. Then I heard her dad come in and go in his room. I said that I needed to go talk to him for a couple of minutes. I went into his room and that's when he came on to me. At first I tried to resist and then I gave in a little bit. Then I tried to resist again and back and forth. I could see from the light under the doorway that Sharon was pacing back and forth on the other side of the door. Probably wondering what was going on. He had a tub of water sitting by his bed so I asked him to give me a foot massage and that would be my excuse as to why I was in there so long. He soaked my feet in a tub and rubbed them. He was very attentive. It was very nice. One of the girls opened the door and saw us and got really upset. This is odd as I have it recorded twice. The other part of the recording said I used this excuse with Sharon and she was fine with it. They lived in an apartment building as I did. They lived a couple floors above me I think. I tried to go back to my own apartment but I didn't have my key with me and I couldn't remember my apartment number."
"0335"	"(2001-11-27)"	"I was moving into Grandma F's old house. I'm not sure why I was moving in there. I don't recall actually moving my things in. I had come down the gravel driveway and I was hearing a lot of noise and thought it was my car. Then I realized that there was a car behind me. It was as though I was spinning in the gravel and couldn't move forward. I finally got it off into the grass and then I realized the noise was coming from the car behind me. They went ahead forward and backed into one of the buildings. There was a man in there working on cars. It was where the chicken house used to be. Maybe it was the chicken house. I thought it was incredible that they were able to get there car backed into the small opening of the building without any problem at all because they didn't seem to have control of the car, the accelerator or the brakes. I don't know if that man ended up being able to help them or not. It seems that he couldn't. They left. It was two black men in a car and I don't know how often St. Joe sees black people. Aunt M came back and showed me the different keys for each of the doors and how to get in. There was a big gap in the doors when you closed them. I was concerned about that for the winter as far as keeping it warm and how much extra it would cost to heat. Especially since I don't like a cold house at all. She talked about what it would take to fix it but she didn't actually say she would get it fixed. I don't know what that was about. Mother was back there. We talked about the people who had lived there before and what had happened to them and them moving out. The brother of one of those women was looking for them and didn't realize they had moved out and was talking about that a little bit. Then I guess he just left. I don't know. Mother and I went into one part of the house. It's not familiar to me. It's around the furnace. We found a bunch of boxes. I looked in one of the boxes and there was a bunch of canning lids and I started to pull those out for mother and then I realized there was other stuff in there. I ended up looking in all the boxes. I found some white and colored gauze. I found a really valuable book on dreams written by Carl Jung and it was in mint condition. I was so excited I was in tears. I was really surprised to find it. that grandma had such a book and that it was in such good condition and that I had found it. For some reason one of the women who used to live there was there now. She had some kind of injury and needed some gauze and first aid tape. I didn't want to give her all the ones that were pretty colors cause I was going to save that and use it as ribbon. I gave her some of the white. As the dream continued she wasn't there anymore. When I took all this stuff in the house and put it away and drug all the empty boxes out into the trash pile, which was in the center of the circular driveway by the barn. I realized I hadn't had lunch and was getting a headache. I found myself a snack bar and ate that. We kept working. That didn't really do the trick so I went down and fixed myself a bowl of soup. We were going through kitchen cabinets. I found some things that the other women had left and was throwing away things that I wouldn't use like baby formula. I sat down and was eating my soup. I'm not sure how to explain this. I felt we were sitting inside yet at the same time it felt like outside as it was a picnic table and there was a lot of greenery and hay and cobwebs at the one end of the table. This stuff was going in my soup. I was picking it out and getting disgusted by it. I started moving all this stuff away from the end of the table. All these family members were now. Bob F and his family were there. BJ, Mike A and family were there. Nicholas F climbed up to the table and grabbed my soup. I said, hey bud how about if I fix you a bowl of your own. He said okay and I started looking for a small bowl for him. While I was doing that Mike A started telling a story. He stopped and somebody said that he didn't think I was listening. I said, I'm listening I'm just looking for a bowl for Nicholas F while I'm listening. I don't know if he ever continued his story or not. I got Nicholas F some soup and then I started going back through the cabinets again. I said, ah here is the important stuff, the pasta! We talked a little bit about my spaghetti container here at home and how I always keep it full and that spaghetti is my primary comfort food. I was telling everyone about the dream book I found and how excited I was about that. Mother and I were outside. I realized that I needed to take a broom and sweep off the outside windows and walls because they were full of cobwebs and dirt and stuff. I went back inside and. this is really strange. It is as though I was sitting inside and mother was sitting outside and I wanted to raise the shades. They were the old-fashioned roll shades. I lifted up the screen and realized I still couldn't' get to it so I asked mother to raise the shade. Then I thought that was really odd and that I would have to go outside every time I wanted to raise or lower a shade. My soup was full of grass, and dirt and cobwebs. I asked mother where the compost pile was. She showed me and I went out and got rid of the rest of my soup. It was vegetable soup. I was pushing all of this greenery stuff away from the table so that wouldn't happen anymore. I told the others that they could come and visit now but that was part of my apprehension about moving in there - that people would be dropping any and all the time. I wasn't sure I was ready for that. It is one of the things I appreciated about living further away."
"0336"	"(2001-11-29)"	"We went to visit a friend or someone I know that lives in the country. He has 22 acres of land and he was going to be on the news with his tractor and with a cow or a dog. He does these tricks with this animal and his tractor. I can't really explain what the tricks were even though I can visualize one of them a bit. There was some comment about how good the food was there and about it being out in the country and being an hour away from something but I don't know what. I was asleep in one of the bedrooms and someone came in and crawled in bed with me and I couldn't wake up. I thought that it was really happening and I couldn't wake up and I was feeling for the person. I thought maybe it was Nick R. I kept saying, Nick R, is that you? But he wouldn't answer. Finally, the dog went in and started attacking this person and chased him away. It turns out it wasn't Nick R. The dog was kind of shaking me. I was finally able to wake up then. There was something else about this dog but I can't remember what now. I closed the bedroom door then and stuck something under the door. The dog grabbed it and drug it outside and was attacking it. It was just sitting there tapping his paw against the floor and guarding this thing. I guess because it still had the scent of this man. I finally got up and went out and said good dog and then said something else to him so he knew he didn't have to stand guard anymore. It was a collie. There was another little dog, like the one on the Taco Bell commercials, came in too and I picked him up and took him inside and let him run up the steps."
"0337"	"(2001-11-29)"	"We were getting ready to take Matthew to the hospital for his surgery. Bill F was going to go with me. I guess it was Bill F, Matthew, and me. Doctor Pa and Doctor Pi were both there too. They had some kind of stockings over their faces, making their faces look very strange, like a bank robber might do. They had them over their faces for the surgery, which they were discussing. Doctor Pa planned for the surgery and some options. I wanted to be sure what they were talking about. I said I would like to get it all done today and someone said, ok. Well, then that's what we'll do. I still didn't know what that meant. The five of us were going to drive to the hospital together. At first I asked if I was to ride in the ambulance with Matthew or drive separately. I think they said we could all just drive. I asked Doctor Pa if he wanted to drive and the rest of us just ride along since he knew the best way. He said that was fine."
"0338"	"(2001-12-04)"	"Before I arrived or before I got into the house I was talking on the phone or something about having had some surgery. So I was arriving in pajamas and a robe and I was talking about a itch and about how each time I scratched the itch my gown moved up a little bit and I was making jokes about that. So I was still joking about that when I entered the home to begin the lecture. I was using a hairbrush to scratch my itch. I was sharing my life story of my journey to finding my current path. It was an in-home lecture. Some of it was my family and some were, I suppose, friends of family. I remember specifically Mother, Daddy, Bev, Aunt P, Larry K, Bruce W, Dick W, Sue K, Linda W. At one point, when I was kind of caught off guard, I had forgotten that this was the purpose of this lecture so I was having a little bit of trouble composing myself to start to talk. I found myself very teary and didn't want this to be a tearful talk. I was also somewhat concerned because my parents were there and I was guarded on what I wanted to share in front of them and I also did not want to hurt them in anyway by anything I said. I finally got started and a couple of times people started their own conversations about unrelated things. I just quit talking until they all quit talking and decided to pay attention. I was thinking how rude that was and how much it irritates me. I find it disrespectful to a speaker. I went through a little bit of my history and I got to People's drug stores and I started that maybe I needed to fast forward through. just recap company closings, etc and how I took that as a sign to change career paths.  "
"0339"	"(2001-12-05)"	"I was working for BCC. Our desks were right next to each other as they were in waking life when I worked there. The daughter of the boss was working right next to me. She was younger and turned the radio up really loud. I don't remember what kind of music it was or if that bothered me also or if it was just the volume. I asked her to turn it down and she refused. I reached over and turned it down myself and told her it was difficult to hear on the phone with the music so loud. She just reached out and turned it back up. I reached down and turned it down again. She turned it back up. The boss came up and told me to just let it go so I quit. I was just working there part-time. I remember I was packing up all of my personal things in plastic grocery bags and I was surprised at how much I had. I had two of them full of nothing but candles. all different colors and sizes. The boss had left. It wasn't that I was present but I knew that he was talking to someone about my leaving and concerned about it. He didn't want me to leave. He finally came back and was negotiating with me to stay. My negotiations included a $2 an hour increase in pay and 3 weeks paid vacation and I don't remember what else."
"0340"	"(2001-12-08)"	"Matthew and I were on our way to St. Joe and we stopped on the rode and picked up Bob A. He was back in my home state to visit his family. He is a career army officer and lives in Texas I believe. We stopped and picked him up and agreed to take him home before we went to see my parents. He and I were both giving Matthew directions while he and I both chatted. his parents did not live where they do/did in waking life. He directed Matthew to some back roads. I told him I didn't remember his parents living back there or moving back there. We got to his house and four of his brothers came out. In waking life they were not his brothers but Don Sc and three of his brothers. I commented to Bob A that he and his brothers haven't changed a bit in 25 years, that they all looked exactly like they did when I graduated from high school. I was looking at their height and such. I was amazed that they still looked the same. They hadn't seemed to age at all, height, weight, etc. After we got there we find out that Daddy had wanted to borrow their tractor. I think Bill F was there already but I don't know if he had a car back there or if someone took him there and was waiting for us to take the tractor back to the house. We ended up with three vehicles though. We had my car, a truck, and the tractor. Matthew drove the truck. I drove the car. Bill F drove the tractor. The Sc boys came out to do something to the truck or the tractor. We're getting ready to take the vehicles and tractor back to daddy but now it is Uncle H and Aunt R's house. We're in their garage and there is stuff piled everywhere, wall-to-wall and 5 or 6 feet high. Uncle H is cleaning things out and getting ready to get rid of a lot of stuff. Aunt R is in very good health. Her and I were talking about doing this cleaning. I said, yes, in the last few weeks I've been cleaning a lot of closets and drawers in my own home. It feels so good having done that. Getting rid of stuff that I never use or look at. that just sits there. We were looking for some paper towels because there was oil all over the seat of the tractor. Uncle H and Aunt R were being very frugal. They had the select-a-size paper towels and they would give us the smallest possible each time and it wasn't enough to wipe up the oil. I had a sense at one point when I grabbed two additional ones that they were making some kind of comment about how many of these towels we were using. One of us had done something to spill some water on a worktable or something and we used paper towels to clean it up. We tried to clean it up before they noticed but Uncle H saw us. He said not to worry about it, that he does it all the time. He helped us clean it up. I also get the sense that maybe we were putting a lot of this stuff they were getting rid of in this truck that Matthew was going to drive. I took some little stuffed animals or animal toys of some kind, like you would get in a kids meal - and moving them from one spot to another. By the time we got ready to leave the garage had much less stuff in it. Aunt P was there as well. I just saw her once when we were getting ready to leave. I approached her and thanked her for the money she recently sent me and told her how much I appreciated it. She just asked me again to keep it a secret between us. There was some discussion or confusion about who was driving what."
"0341"	"(2001-12-08)"	"Someone had broken into my house. I was wondering if I was dreaming or awake. I thought that I usually only have these dreams when I don't set my house alarm before going to bed and I know I set it last night. But then if I'm dreaming I want to wake myself up and I couldn't. So I was frustrated with myself. I also thought if I'm dreaming and lucid why can't I change what is happening. I could see my front door from my bedroom door, which I can't in waking life. This did not occur to me. I was trying to close and lock my bedroom door very quietly. I was peering out and could see that my front door was partially open. I didn't know if someone had come in and left or if someone was still in the house. I didn't know if it was just maintenance men or someone who had broken in. I went ahead and locked it and hoped that they either wouldn't come upstairs and try to get in or that if they saw that door that maybe they would just leave but they didn't. my bedroom door was right across from the end of my bed. I heard them come up and try the door so I leveraged myself against the door with my feet against the bed hoping to keep them from getting in. I heard them take out the tools and remove the pins in the door. They shouldn't be able to do this from the outside in waking life because the pins are on the inside of the room. But they did remove them. I was being unsuccessful in keeping them out. I tried to reach the alarm pull cord but couldn't get to it. They finally got in and they said something about me not being able to get to it. They didn't hurt me. I started talking to them and trying to be very cooperative so they wouldn't get violent or hurt me. There were both men and women. They said that they had recently bought or built a new home and they were here to get things that they needed or could use in their new house. I said I was surprised that they wanted anything that I have. I went downstairs with them and they had a very large pile of my things that they were going to take with them. One of things that they had was my black everyday dishes. I asked them to let me keep those and I would give them my expensive china that I never use. I told them that it was Noritake, very elegant, and there were many more place settings, etc. so they agreed to that. I was going through these wood cabinets, kind of like an armoire, though they were built into the wall. They had many different size compartments. Some were drawers. Some had doors. Some were just open. I thought this must be a dream because I don't have these cabinets in waking life. I was looking for the china and couldn't find it. I told them the one box was an old whiskey box that would be used to ship 12 bottles. I was getting very nervous because I was afraid they would think that I was lying and didn't really have the china. I suggested that they might have found it already and not realized it. I turned around and saw it sitting in their pile and pointed it out. I told them the other box was the original box and said china on the sides of it. We found it too then."
"0342"	"(2001-12-09)"	"Bruce W and Carl W were chasing me all over trying to tickle my feet. Aunt J had given me these two beautiful armoires and they had circular racks made of wood. They held ties and clothing that had belonged to Uncle A. The circular racks were about 6 feet tall and approximately 2 feet in diameter. As they spun it was beautiful color. The one was completely covered with ties. The other with other clothing."
"0343"	"(2001-12-09)"	"I was on this, I don't know what, and Nick R came back. He told me that he never takes me with him because I wouldn't fit in with his rich and famous friends. He told me I wasn't good enough to be with his wealthy friends. He was drinking while I was in the car with him. The roads were yet and he was driving very fast. I was very frightened. It was after that, that he said those things to me. I went ahead and got dressed and was going to meet one of his friends that he told me I wasn't good enough to meet. I was dressed very nicely. There is so much to this and I don't know what order it goes in. I was with someone but I don't know whom. I don't know if I was married to him. We had gone on a trip and I had bought a lot of Native American items, jewelry, feathers, blankets, etc. It was really fabulous. Our butler wasn't around to help us pack and we were in a hurry and we had a baby and we were trying to grab a few things because we had to meet this duchess/important woman. We just had so many beautiful things. Some of them were very small. I was pulling them off and putting them in drawers and stuff so they would be safe to travel and so we wouldn't lose anything. We just left everything else for our butler, hoping that he would get back and be able to get it all packed up for us in time to catch our train. We went in this special place to meet this woman. She was lying on a bed. I curtsied and shook her hand, as did our nanny/assistant to me. We chatted with her briefly. I had to do different things to make sure I was sitting in the right place and sitting properly, etc. The woman is in a hot tub with her husband and making love to him. We were all trying to avert our eyes. My husband had also been sitting on a bed and he fell asleep. I got up and walked away and I was trying to figure out what to do or where to go. I ended up in a hot tub with someone but I have no idea who it was. It wasn't my husband but a man who truly appreciated me. After Nick R told me I wasn't good enough, I got dressed up and I was going to go meet some woman by myself-one of his wealthy friends. I knew my way out. I thought Oh yes, I know my way out because I dreamt this. I dreamt it earlier in the same dream. I went to this woman and her name was Betty [unknown in waking life] . She was very classy. She welcomed me and she could tell I was upset and she asked me why. I told her and she was very sympathetic. She asked me if I would like some strawberries and cream. I was looking at my assistant and this woman to take the lead on what to do and how to act. I got a very small bowl of strawberries and cream. I didn't go sit with them but rather stood back in a dark spot where I wouldn't be seen in case I did something wrong or spilled something, etc. One of her female staff members came to me and asked me if I would like to go sit down and I said, very truthfully I would really like a place where I can sit and be alone. She took me to this place where I could sit by myself. It was like a bench in a closet. As I was sitting there eating, the bowl was suddenly much larger and fuller than when I started. I was fighting back the tears. I hadn't eaten all day so I was very hungry and very tired. But then someone came in and told me that they had to hide me. So I put my feet up on this bench and they pulled the clothes past me. These two young men came in. It was their closet and they were looking for some clothes. The mother and the staff person were trying to distract them and try to hurriedly select something so they wouldn't discover me but they did. They were so kind and compassionate. They wanted to know what happened and I told them. They told me that he didn't deserve to be with someone like me. They said I have so much love to give and just want to care for someone and be attentive to them. I wanted to go sit with Aunt J and ask her to tell me all about Uncle A. For some reason, at some point I sensed that he was the one I was with. He was protecting me as a spirit protector. There was also something about one or more housing subdivisions. Maybe flying over them?"
"0344"	"(2001-12-09)"	"I was with my CIIS classmates and we were at some kind of army facility. We were working on a project to reduce violence or develop methods other than weapons to defeat the enemy. We were having different meetings. At times I was frustrated because, as usual, people weren't hearing me or weren't truly considering what I was saying. We had found some toy green plastic army men. We had decided to make something like a biscuit and place the toys inside the biscuit. The others wanted to put them in before baking the biscuit. I told them they would melt that way and that we would have to put it in later. They all disagreed with me and they were going to go ahead and do it their way. Really strange. I don't know how that ended up but I think I saved one out to maybe do myself, my way. I moved on to the kitchen area where the men on KP duty were preparing meals. I learned that a lot of our men got sick from that food. One of the reasons was that they got salmonella poisoning from hamburgers that had been cooked but then had been left sit out too long. The cooks would not know how many to prepare at a time and they didn't want to run out so they would prepare more than they thought they needed. They didn't want to throw any away so they would leave them sit out until the next group of men came in to eat. I had suggested that they have a counter at the doorway. a bar like you see at an entertainment venue. so it would count the number of men coming in. The men in the kitchen would be able to see/watch it and could use that as a gauge to determine how many to prepare. The head cook thought that was a great idea and said he would take it to the proper decision-maker. I pursued that a little bit and told him I was going to follow up with him and see how that conversation went and so forth. I met someone and I introduced myself as the future VP of the US. He kind of chuckled. I chuckled too but said, you just watch. A little bit later I met Hillary Clinton. She was the President of the US. I again introduced myself as the future VP of the US. We chatted a bit and I said, I'll be following up on that counter idea. She looked at me quizzically as she didn't know what I was talking about. Someone else was in our conversation and said, we'll talk about that later. I went back to the kitchen and I was still looking at things there. It occurred to me, I suggested to someone, if we would be able to poison the enemy's food as an alternative to weaponry. They said yes that would probably be doable. might be fairly easy. There was a discussion about what kind of foods we would use and such. I overheard one of the men talking about getting a divorce when he gets home. I was talking to them about that and discouraging the idea. He said something to me that hurt my feelings. I said so and was being a little dramatic about it but not letting on that I was. He apologized and I said, we'll make that. I had been standing on the other side of the counter so I went around the corner and gave him a hug but he didn't let go. He was kind of joking around and kind of doing that for the benefit of his buddies there because they were getting a real chuckle watching us. Then he kissed me. A long time. Then he asked me how I learned to kiss like that. Then he whispered in my ear, you want to give them a real show now? We'll give them a little tongue. I said, You want to give them a real show? Just follow my lead. Because I didn't think the first kiss was that good."
"0345"	"(2001-12-09)"	"I was with Eric and Stephanie Forrester. I think we were watching two of their small grandchildren. One was a boy and another a girl. I think they were playing hide and seek inside the house. It was dark outside. The little girl went outside. There was a lot of greenery. shrubs and such, narrow paths, steps, etc. I knew as soon as she went out she was going to be very hard to follow and keep my eye on her. I called to Eric that I needed him to come out right away to help. I finally grabbed her and brought her back inside but she went right back out. She said something about us trying to keep her inside. She said something like oh yeah, watch this. She turned into a very small chameleon or a lizard or some such and darted into the dirt. As soon as she came back up I grabbed her. At this point, Eric and Stephanie and the boy were out there and they had each grabbed one also. None of us knew which one was the little girl or if any of them were her. We took them and put them in this box. Now they were like snack cakes. We were trying to figure out which one was this little girl. Each of us took a bite off of one thinking that it would make her turn back into a girl. It didn't work. Someone had suggested that if we did that we would figure out which one was her. The little boy just kept eating until they were all gone. As soon as he did he realized what he had done and he got very upset and was crying."
"0346"	"(2001-12-09)"	"I was in this place and I was monitoring,. It was like a shelf with stacks of tea bags. They were four deep and maybe 8 high stacks. They were right up against each other. Somewhere along these stacks of teabags there were also some other things like bags of M & M's. There was something else but I don't remember what. Even though they were teabags and candy, they were meant for these babies we were caring for. They were like health supplies or nutrition or something for these babies. There was a baby that needed one in particular and we were out of that one or a baby needed something and we didn't know what or maybe I had given the last of what that baby needed to someone else. Then there were these little packages of something like lifesavers. They looked like lifesavers but they were more like sugared jelly candy in mini-rolls. I opened one up to show someone what they really were."
"0347"	"(2001-12-12)"	"Don from the Get Real Challenge on Oprah was at my house. I had the impression that we were just friends but that he was interested in more than that. We were sitting in the kitchen of my birth home. He was having, maybe ill or some kind of medical problem. We went to the bathroom several times. The last time he came out he looked like he was going to fate. He leaned up against the wall, the corner, and was holding on to doorknobs. His face just got blood red, deep dark red. Blood started pouring out of his face. Primarily out of the area of his right eye but it practically covered his whole face. I didn't know what to do. I grabbed some tissue to hold onto to blot up the blood while I called 911. When I called 911. at first I was having difficulty dialing it. I kept dialing the wrong numbers because it was kind of dark and I couldn't see the numbers. Finally got the number and told them who it was and they said, Oh no, not him again. They finally did come and took him out."
"0348"	"(2001-12-12)"	"I was in the kitchen backing chocolate chip cookies for Matthew as a reward for something. I don't know if I forgot about them or what but I came back to the kitchen and the two trays in the oven were very done. I had not even switched the bottom tray to the top yet so I took them out and then I noticed that there were different kinds on the one tray from the bottom. I realized that they were left there from our cookie baking day in December. There were snickerdoodles, chocolate chip cookies and something else. I had newspaper spread out on the kitchen counters and was spreading out these cookies. I ate one or two of them. Some other people coming through the kitchen would grab one and eat them. I said that I was baking them for Matthew. Matthew seemed to be younger than in waking life. BJ came in and said something about these other kinds being in there if I was baking chocolate chip cookies. At first I just kind of grinned at her, afraid to tell her what they were from. She guessed, ah. They were left over from cookie baking day. I said, yes they were. There was another child there working on some homework. At first it seemed like boy and I made some comment about the cookies being a reward and how well that works as a reward. Later it seemed that it was a little girl and she was working off the money that she had wanted and her parents had bought for her. She didn't realize how expensive it was. Somehow I lifted up a piece of paper or something to see how much it cost and it was $300+ dollars. I just thought it was going to take her forever to work off, that she had no idea how expensive that thing was."

"0352"	"(2001-12-17)"	"I was in Bev's house and they were having a problem with their roof. The construction company had to tear all of the insides out and rebuild it to repair the roof. They tore out all the inside walls and completely rebuilt it. When they repainted I noticed what a sloppy job they were doing. They really did a very bad job. I wondered if it was because they had a bad attitude because they had to redo all that work or if they were just in a hurry, or maybe just poor quality normally. I was just wondering what the deal was. I was going upstairs, maybe into an attic. I almost hit my head on a board that they were attaching. I asked them if it was attached that low before and so they raised it a little bit."
"0353"	"(2001-12-22)"	"Matthew and I were moving into this new apartment. It was here in the city where I live yet it was on the beach. It was a big place. It was one story. Had a big screened in porch. There was a lot of room. Bill F and Brian F were moving in with us too. There were two different rooms that I was deciding between for my office. The first one I decided on we had moved all my things into. Then I decided that the other one faced the screened-in porch and ocean so I decided to make that my office instead. That way I could work in there and listen to and feel the ocean. Then there were two other rooms. One for storage and another for a laundry room. It wasn't a fancy place. I was just absolutely in love with it because it was on the ocean and because of the screened-in porch. I kept saying how great it was to be on the ocean and that it was even less expensive than where we were living now. Bev and her family were there helping us move. As we were moving I was asking different people if they had been out to the beach yet. Bev had because she loves the ocean as much as I do and she just thought it was so great. I said, good, now you'll come to visit me more. She said, Absolutely. Especially in the summer. I asked her if she had taken Rachel S out to the beach yet and she said she had and that Rachel S had loved it. Stephen F was there and Mari Kate S. They were being especially helpful. One other thing I remember is that there was a lot of furniture that I was trying to move around in these rooms. I at least wanted to get all of the furniture to the right rooms before everyone left. Some of the furniture was in pieces and had to be put back together."

"0355"	"(2001-12-25)"	"I was at my birth home with all of my siblings. I was trying to talk Bill F and Brian F into switching bedrooms with Bev and me. One of them didn't want to do it but I don't remember why. I was trying to get them to switch, first of all, because Daddy had put a sliding glass door to the patio in their room. I had Sir Gallahad and I had decided to keep him because Bill F was going to be his primary caretaker. If I had the room with the sliding glass door I could put him out on the patio at night and he would be easier to clean up after. Bev didn't want to switch rooms and Bill F didn't want to switch. We talked a little bit about Brian F and Bev sharing a room and Bill F and I sharing a room. But then we decided that was not the best idea at our age. We finally ended up switching bathrooms. We ended up doing a major remodel to the bathroom that was going to belong to Bev and me. When we got done with the remodel it had a kind of Florida feel to it. It was a lot of white wicker. Very spacious. Mother said after we were done that she was really glad we had remodeled because she liked it so much more. We moved the bathtub. We took the shower stall out. It was very nice. We had fixed up a whole closet for Sir Gallahad and for another animal. a duck. Sir Gallahad learned how to talk. I don't remember what he said. The sliding glass doors from the boys room seemed to be at the back of the closet. I had to move all of these clothes out of the way every time I wanted to open or close it. I don't think we were going to put Sir Gallahad out there after all. Bill F and someone else had been working with him and gotten him to a point where the hall closet worked very well for him. I remember what we did but not well enough to describe it. Part of the trick was getting him to stay in there at bedtime. It seems that someone else was involved somehow. But I can't remember who or why. Even though Bev and I were living there and sharing a room, Mari Kate S and Andrew S were also there. After we had finished all of the remodeling we were having problems with the toilet in the boys room. It almost overflowed every time you flushed it. Every time we tried to flush it Daddy would have to run in and stop it before it did overflow. I kept having to go to the bathroom so I kept going to use the one we just finished remodeling. But then the last time we used it we had the same problem there. It did overflow a little before Daddy got in there. Earlier, before we did all this moving around or something in Bev and my room, the housekeeper came in and vacuumed the floor. There were some bugs and stuff. I said, well, that's not my fault. She said, no it isn't. There was all this powder and I said, honestly, all the powder is my fault. We wanted to finish cleaning up from our work in the bathrooms. It was getting late and Bev wanted to get Mari Kate S and Andrew S home. We made Andrew S lie down in the boy's room but that wasn't working because he kept getting up. Then I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. There were two toilets in there. One sitting out in the room where their white chair always used to sit and the other was in the closet. Andrew S wanted some milk. I went to the refrigerator. There was a baby bottle in there, partially full. Bev told me to just fill that up and give it to him. I didn't even question the fact that I was giving him a baby bottle. I was just questioning filling that one up and giving that one to him. Somebody said that Mother had plenty of milk so it wasn't a problem. So I went ahead and did that. I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. Later he got back up again anyway. I had gone into the bathroom and started cleaning up while everyone else was doing something else. I had gotten most of the mess cleaned up except for scrubbing the floor. When I did that Andrew S was sleeping in there. I asked Bev if I could scrub that while Andrew S was sleeping and she told me no. I took him to Mother and Daddy's room to sleep. I did end up scrubbing the bathroom. Nick R was there waiting for us to get done. He finally said he had to go. It was pretty late at night and I was concerned about him driving home and staying awake. He apologized and said that he was sorry but he really had to go because he had an early morning. Andrew S kept interrupting us. Bev was trying to stop him. I was trying to say good-bye. I walked out into the kitchen and was sitting in the corner of the counter. He moved close to me, in between my legs and said he really wanted another chance. I questioned that it would make any difference. He said that it might not make any difference on the phone calls but it would make a difference in any other way. I was really debating and asked him why it wouldn't make any difference on the phone calls but I woke up before he answered."
"0356"	"(2001-12-25)"	"The power went out. I got my flashlight but the batteries were going dead so I went into the office to try to get two fresh batteries. I realized there were ants everywhere. It was really freaking me out, even though ants don't bother me in waking life. They were all over the carpet, climbing up the walls, in the closet. I just kind of dumped the bag of batteries on the floor. I couldn't find two batteries the right size for my flashlight. I made my way downstairs. The ants were down the steps, climbing up the hallway walls, all over downstairs. So I was trying to move very quickly and get into the toolbox and get that flashlight so I could get into the breaker box and flip the breakers to try to get the power back on. While I was trying to get to the other flashlight Matthew came down and wanted to know what was going on."
"0357"	"(2002-01-07)"	"I was in a hotel. I was trying to get out and I was flying. Somehow when I was flying to get out I kept getting to one point where I would get turned around and right back to where I was. I no longer had control and something turned me around and sent me back. There were Christmas trees in this hotel with the old-fashioned tinsel. I thought the trees were so pretty. I ended up in this bar. Maybe there were strippers in there. I was lying on the bar and there was a man there who was my bodyguard. I just thought, I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to get out of here. He came with me. He was going to get me out of there. We were trying to leave the hotel, only now there was another couple with us. It was a black couple. As we were trying to leave the hotel, we kept coming to these things that you might see in an amusement park fun house. It looked like; I don't know how to describe it, like one looked like it was a spiral. It just looked like a picture but you could actually walk into it. You didn't know. You had to just walk into this picture and you didn't know what was going to happen. We did that. Then we came to another place that looked like squares that just kept getting smaller. I actually led us into that one. I had some kind of square thing that one was red. The spiral thing was kind of like silver and black. I had this red square. We were going through. It got to a point where it was so small. I realized that we weren't going to be able to go any further. I said, back up. Back up. For some reason I thought we had to do it quickly. This man I was with, my bodyguard. It was he and I and two other women. He got us out of the hotel and we were in a car. He was driving really fast. He headed into the woods on this road. The road was extremely hilly and curvy. I was very scared because you couldn't see what was in front of you. He was totally confident. Some of those hills were so steep down and so steep back up again. The kind that makes your stomach jump. He is going through the woods. All of the sudden we were in water. Our car was floating in the water. I said, roll down the windows and try to grab some bottles or pieces of wood or something that you can use as a paddle. None of the other three would grab anything. I grabbed a bottle and began paddling. I got us very quickly to a dock. It was out in the middle of the water but it was a dock attached to a house. They couldn't believe how quickly I got us there. I didn't tell them but there was an animal underwater that actually pulled us to the dock. It just seemed that I did it. It was a cow, because later it was a cow's head. We got out of the car and these people invited us in. It turned out to be the family of one of the girls that was with us. I think one of the girls with us was named Phoebe and I think it was her family. They loaned us a boat. We were standing on the dock before then. I was talking to Phoebe and said, You know. This is probably the highlight of our life. This trip that we've been on and where we're going. I don't remember where we were going. She agreed. I said, We really need to just enjoy and appreciate this trip while we're on it. Because we will likely never do anything like this again in our lives. Somewhere along here, before Phoebe joined us, myself and this man were in love. This other woman. I think her name was Patty [unknown] but I don't know here. The three of us decided that we would live together. We decided that we would tell people that we knew. When we were driving, we were driving along this field and saw a friend of ours working in this field. We stopped and were talking to him, I think the man I was in love with was named Tom [unknown in waking life] . Tom told this man, Yep, Patty and I are going to live together. He didn't say anything about me. I was really upset and hurt. I didn't say anything. Then I saw a penny along the road and picked it up. Patty and Tom got in the car. I saw a whole bunch of change along the road and I started picking it up. They were getting really aggravated with me. They kept saying, come on. We've got to go. We've got to go. I was picking up all of this change and putting it in my pocket. When I finally got in the car they said, don't you realize what you were doing was illegal? Picking up that money. I didn't understand what they were talking about. why they thought picking up this money that someone had dropped along the road was illegal. They apparently thought it belonged to this man that we stopped and talked to. We were in the car and Tom and Patty both knew I was really upset because of what Tom had said to our friend and that he didn't mention me. Tom took his pants off like he wanted to have sex with me, as though that would make everything better. I wouldn't have any part of that. We were headed into the road. This is when Phoebe was with us now too. Phoebe's parents loaned us this boat. We were in the boat headed someplace. Phoebe was talking about being pregnant. I said, that's alright Phoebe. You and I can get an apartment and I can help you take care of your baby. Everything will be fine. We learned that Patty was pregnant too but it wasn't Tom's baby. I went back to Phoebe's parent's house. The others were attacked by some men on another boat. I hid under the house when they came there. They left. Tom came back and told me that he realized that I was the only one he really loved. We kissed."

"0359"	"(2002-01-14)"	"I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop. Then when I finished I turned to her and I said okay now if you would share. She said, No, I don't want to now. I said, well, that's pretty childish but okay. The people in the group were pretty amazed at the examples I gave them. They left."
"0360"	"(2002-01-14)"	"We had set up this thing to make people that Jennifer K had been killed. I mean we did the funeral and everything. Then later we had her hiding at Jean H and Carl H's house. After the funeral was over I went back there to see her and we realized that the people who tried to kill her the first time were out there somewhere so we crouched way down in a field. They came through and they were poking through the weeds with a stick and they just barely missed the top of our heads. It was a good thing that we were crouched down far enough. Fortunately they couldn't see us. And most people still believed that she had died. There were three men involved. The one man, the one who was the head of the ring, the worst character of the three, actually ended up dying. The other two ended up being hurt or injured or something because they ended up in the hospital. The one died and the other two recovered and did a complete turn around in their lives. I think I ended up dating one of them or being married to one of them."

It was like it was raining inside it was so bad. My parents were away and I was trying to track them down and get the message to them and try to figure out what to do. Because it was just everywhere, so I couldn't even set buckets under drips. It wouldn't do any good to mop it up because it was raining so hard and was coming in so fast."

Then Bev and her family were going to be leaving soon and she asked me if I wanted to take a nap with Rachel S. So I went in to take a nap with Rachel S. Then when they were getting ready to leave I asked John S about my computer. He said it wasn't done yet. I asked him when it would be and he said not for a week or so. I thought Oh no because all of the information I need for job hunting and for school and everything was on there. So then, they kind of hurried and started packing up. He was going to try to start working on it. I said, no, I will find someone in the city where I live to finish it. I don't remember what else happened with that. We were changing Rachel S's diaper and she had a big growth near her genitals and I was afraid to ask Bev about it. I was surprised she didn't say anything. Finally she did. She was frustrated because the doctor's weren't acting concerned or anything."

"0364"	"(2002-01-29)"	"I had to move or I was moving out of my apartment. But the new apartment that I was moving into wasn't ready yet. I was having a sense that I was moving with someone and that I wasn't. I don't know which it was. We were trying to find a place to live while we were waiting for our new place to be ready. There was like an old shed on the property that we were moving from so we were just going to move in there. We went to one side of this shed and someone was living in there. It turned out that it was somebody who had just moved their things in there without permission. When we told her that we had to move in there she left. Then we went to the other side and saw that there was room there also. It sounds like a duplex but the doors were on opposing walls. That side was full of junk. There was some kind of concern about maybe something we needed not being there. I'm not sure. Maybe there was no bathroom in it or no kitchen maybe. I just don't know. I went to check on the progress of my new apartment and they had the floor down but no walls up or anything like that. I started moving things over there, small things like lamps and such. They weren't in boxes, though. I was simply taking them over there and sitting them on the wood floor. I was talking to a couple of the workmen. I thought Oh well. I have all this stuff all over the floor now. Now there is no room to bring the furniture in."

"0366"	"(2002-01-31)"	"I was on the television program Just Shoot Me. It was apparently my first time on the show. I was standing waiting, ready for my cue to go on. I was to go into Jack P's office through a side door with a cigar box. There were two short cigars in the box but they actually looked like two rosebuds lying on a white cloth. Before my cue he came out and I was standing next to a crewmember. He said to the crew don't have them offer me or ask me to smoke one of the cigars because I don't want to do that. She nodded yes and he walked away. I thought hmmm, when I go on I'm going to ask him to smoke one of the cigars with me. It was my cue and I went on and he was standing on the right end of his desk and I walked around him to the left end and I opened the cigar box and said here, join me. It kind of threw him for a loop. He acted like he couldn't see or something so I moved around the front of the desk closer to him and again offered him the cigar. Then someone else came in and took them and said something and left. We touched and he was saying something to one of the crew about my doing that and so I decided that I needed to go apologize. We were done for the day and he was in his dressing room, I suppose. I went back and excused myself and said, I really wanted to apologize. He kind of looked at me. I said, Well, I was standing right next to the crew person when you said you didn't want me to do that. It bothered me that you just didn't say it to me since I was standing right there. He smiled. I said, but still, that's no excuse and I am sorry that I did that. He seemed to like that. He smiled and said No problem. Don't worry about it. He left. It was a really weird set. When I was going in and out I was climbing over these boxes and up over these walls and back down. One time when I came in there were all of these boxes piled up, some above my head, with stuff like different bright colored paper towels, different colors of toilet paper and all kinds of stuff. In one box there were marshmallows, both big and small. One of the bags of the large ones was open so I took a couple of them and ate them. One other time Jack P was looking for the marshmallows. He had expressed a romantic interest in me. I think it was to someone else first and then I heard about it. I thought that was very exciting."
"0367"	"(2002-02-02)"	"I stopped to see Dorothy S. What a mistake! She was at home baking cookies for the church or school. There were cookies everywhere. Valentine's day cookies. I stopped in and she greeted me, but not with a hug or anything like she would have in waking life. She opened the door and let me in. I went in and tried to have a conversation and I misworded something and she was asking me what was going on so I told her. She said she wasn't going to go back to school. She was very content being a full time mom and homemaker. I thought that was great. Unfortunately, then I worded the next thing wrong, I said if I could stay home and live off someone else I would do it in a heartbeat. That was not the best way to word it. I went on to say, but I would want to continue my dreamwork because I get such a high off it. It is just so much fun and so rewarding. She just looked at me and didn't smile or respond or anything. I tried to repair my first sentence by saying I think it would be great to be at home full-time to take care of the house and things like that. Her youngest daughter, Tina S, came out. Then they had to go to the school to pick up Tara S. She asked me if I wanted to go along so I did. We got to this school and there was a basket with a bunny in it. I get a sense that it was Tina S's. Dorothy S asked me if I still had my rabbit. I said, No, as he got older and developed his adult coat I became more and more allergic to him. She said, Oh, that was just his first coat. If you had waited until his second you would have been fine. I was thinking, that was his second coat. I didn't say anymore. The rabbit in the basket got away and we were chasing it and he hopped up a tree and was hopping around on the branches. We were having trouble catching him. Finally he started back down and I was able to grab him. I held on to him until- Dorothy S went into the school to get Tara S. When they came out they had this stuff in her hands including this really big stuffed pink animal. When we drove to school I was sitting in the front seat with Dorothy S and Tina S was in back. I don't _____ getting in the car. We went back to. On the way back to her house she was talking about exercising and how she has this stationary bicycle that is so easy to do an hour a day on. She has been doing that and how good she feels. While I was watching her walk into the school to get Tara S it looked to me like she was pregnant. I wasn't going to ask if she wasn't going to say anything because I would hate to be wrong. Because that would imply that she looks like she is pregnant, which she does to me. Anyway, she was talking about what great shape she is in from riding this bike, and going on and on. Then I find out right before I leave that her and Tony S both used the Hollywood 48 diet. After we got home these three men showed up and she was playing racquetball in the house with these three men, in the dining room and family room area. She wasn't really talking much so I finally picked up my keys and said, Well, I'm sorry but I need to go Dorothy S. I tried to wait until they took a little break so I could hug her and she just kind of looked at me and kept playing. So I just waved goodbye and headed out the door and left. I tried to leave but I had car trouble. She gave me keys and was going to let me drive Tony S's white Rolls Royce with red interior convertible home. I was trying to maneuver it to turn it around so I could get out with all of these trees around. Either her mother or Tony S's mother went in and talked to Dorothy S and were kind of, not scolding her but, telling her that she really had no idea what it was like be a single parent responsible for everything in the household. earning the income, trying to keep up the house, do a good job raising the children, etc. That she should have been more kind to me and respectful that I am doing all that and continuing my education."

"0369"	"(2002-02-08)"	"Matt Damon attended two of my dream groups. The one I remember specifically was the second one. We were getting the house ready as best we could for him to come. When he came he wanted to be treated like anyone else. He was just a farm person who was just an actor. I was also having these same thoughts."
"0370"	"(2002-02-08)"	"It seems that I was someone else - maybe. There were three characters, almost like cartoon characters, but we were real. We were in this big warehouse looking for costumes. We were on this trolley that went around the warehouse so you could look for your costume. There were other people on this trolley. As people found their costumes they would ride back to the front door and get off. But finally it was just the three of us and we kept going around and around and we didn't select anything. The owners were getting really upset with us. Finally, they started going really, really fast so we couldn't even see the racks anymore. We were outside walking downtown Indy."
"0371"	"(2002-02-08)"	"I was with family members. It was women and children. We went to an amusement park. We were trying to decide what to do; whether to go ahead and ride some rides or wait for the men to join us. We did ride some rides. On one ride the operator stopped to let someone off and the rest of us in my family decided to get off as well. The men had finally joined us. My husband was a different nationality, dark skinned, about the same height. We weren't walking next to each other. he finally walked up next to me and put his arm around me. He didn't have a shirt on. Average size man. I put my arm around him. I thought it was odd that he didn't have a shirt on and I don't particularly care for men to be out in public without a shirt on. he was sitting and I was standing next to him. I leaned over and I kissed him on the cheek. He gave me a strange look. He said, I don't know why you do that. I said, why, what's the big deal. He just really disproved of any kinds of public displays of affection, even though it was a simple kiss on the cheek. We finally went to this big area, where you could get food and sit down at these long tables to eat. We were sitting there. We had two small children. I don't know if they were twins or simply very close in age. One was a girl and the other a boy. Through most of the dream I thought they were twins. It wasn't until the end of the dream that I questioned that. We were sitting in this dining area and my husband pulled out a gun and shot some people. Then he turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the chest but he didn't die right away. He lied there still for a minute. I was down on the ground next to him, perpendicular to him. I saw him raise his gun and I reached to try to get it away from him so he wouldn't shoot anyway else. Another man was sitting close by and saw. I was weak or injured or something and this other man managed to get the gun away from him. Then my husband died. We are walking toward our cars to go home. I was injured and walking with a cane. I would come to the top of the incline where the floor was polished. It was a really pretty colorful tile. Because it hurt for me to walk I thought I would just slide down the inclines. I would slide until I stopped or until I bumped into something in front of me. I was going to let my daughter stop me at the end. My sister said I couldn't do that because she's so little that I would just knock her over. Of course, she was right. Before we left the amusement park, after my husband died, one of my sisters said, well, Eddie's here. He'll be here for you now. He was either supposed to be my husband now or wanted to marry me. I thought he wasn't that attractive. I wasn't physically attracted to him. He seemed like a nice enough man. I was thinking about this as things progressed. I thought, well, gee with what I've been through you would think he would be a little more attentive to me right now. I was injured and having trouble walking and he didn't really do much to assist me. He didn't ever ask me if I was okay or needed help or anything. I thought that was kind of strange. I was back at my birth home and I was in my bedroom, my two children were in the boy's bedroom. Brian F was there. Daddy was there. I went outside for some reason. Aunt P and Aunt H came. I kind of looked over to Aunt P, hugged her, and started crying/sobbing. She was consoling me. Aunt H went ahead and went inside. I finally went back inside and went into the bathroom. There was something weird about the bathroom but I can't remember now what it was. Then I went back into my room. I just had my robe on and nothing on under it. I was lying on the bed crying. Daddy came in. He was lying on the bed next to me, talking to me and stuff. At this point, it felt like Mother was also dead. So he was talking about how this was difficult for me too. He kept wanting to touch my pubic hair. I kept pushing his hand away and I finally yelled, STOP! He said, why? I said, because it makes me really uncomfortable. He said, well it shouldn't. I said, but it does. He tried one more time and I angrily pushed his hand away and said, STOP IT! He finally got up and left. I was just lying there sobbing and Brian F was fixing lunch. grilled cheese and tomato soup. He asked me if I wanted some. I said, Yes I do. I'll be right out to help. I apparently stayed in my room too long. I went into the other room to my kids and they had been napping and they heard me come in and they both got up came to me. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell them that their daddy is dead. How am I going to raise these two children by myself? I already raised one child by myself. I don't want to do this again. My little girl, she was just a little bit shorter than the boy was. This is when they didn't seem like twins to me. I even questioned it in the dream. Which is really odd they were my children. The little girl asked me where Elly was. She said, mommy. I said, you spend so much time with Elly you think Elly is your mommy. I said, I'm mommy and I'm right here. I guess I didn't tell them about their daddy. I went out to the kitchen to help with lunch and I could see that everyone else was done and Brian F hadn't made anything for me. So, I got stuff out of the refrigerator and I was going to fix myself some lunch. I looked in the living room and Mother was sitting there. I stopped in my tracks. I looked again and I thought, it is mother. I thought, is she alive? So I walked in very slowly and leaned over her. She was sitting on the couch with her head back and looked like she was sleeping. I said, mother? She raised her head and said yes? I just started sobbing and she stood up and I hugged her and I told her that I thought she was dead and I told her how much I loved her."
"0372"	"(2002-02-08)"	"Extremely sexual. I had a lot of mixed emotions. Sadness, discouragement, hope, excitement, anticipation."
"0373"	"(2002-02-09)"	"I saw Bev. She had lost 120 pounds, which would make her maybe 80 pounds. She looked really, really thin. Not necessarily good thin. She had done it in just six weeks."
"0374"	"(2002-02-13)"	"I was at Kings Island with Daddy and three other family members. I don't know which three. Daddy had gone off by himself somewhere and was supposed to meet us at this one spot. We were sitting there for him for a long time. We realized we didn't have much time before we had to leave and I was frustrated that we had spent so much money on tickets to get in and we weren't going to have time to ride a single ride while we were there. We sat down and continued to wait. We finally decided that we needed to just go try to find him. I didn't want to go off by myself because I have trouble finding my way around there and not getting lost. We just all stayed together and it seemed to me that we were retracing our steps. I don't know. this is sketchy. We covered the whole park and didn't find him. We were going to see if they had any kind of a PA system where they could page him. We didn't know how we were going to find him. It was dark and they were closing up. The employees were starting to go home and we were getting really concerned. We didn't know how we were going to find him. I went in to use the restroom. They had very strange restrooms like in a foreign country where they don't actually have a toilet but rather just a drain in the floor. I heard some employees in the restroom talking. It seems as though someone was chasing us or I don't know. We kept going in and out of these hallways. We would accidentally end up in the men's room so we would just rush through hoping we wouldn't be noticed and finding our way out. But we kept weaving in and out of these, like hallways or something, and couldn't find our way out. It was almost like a maze. We would find our way out into a hallway of the building but then there wouldn't be anyplace else to go except a couple of very small doorways, like children's size doorways. Some child had set-up something like traps and told us at the end of that hallway that we had to go just one way. There is a lot missing and a lot that I simply cannot describe. There was no ceiling on this building. The walls of the building started collapsing like dominoes. We jumped on top of them and were just trying to stay on top of them as they toppled over."
"0375"	"(2002-02-14)"	"I was asleep but experiencing extreme periodic limb movements, both arms and legs. I could hear someone say that I should get up and take some Advil or ibuprofen as that would help it tremendously. However, I couldn't wake myself up to do so. I thought I was crying out help me, help me. But no one was around to hear me. At first I was asleep in my own bed here at home and realized that there was no one else in the house to hear me. The scene shifted and I was in my bed at my birth home and I was thinking that BJ would be coming to bed soon and she would hear me and help me. The scene shifted again and I was an elderly person in a group home. I shared a bed with someone and there were four of us in the room. I was experiencing the same thing but the caretakers refused to give us anything. She was a very mean person. Several of us were experiencing health problems that kept us incapacitated and the caretaker preferred it that way. A new caretaker came and she gave us all the medications that we needed to feel better. We immediately began to feel better and we got out of bed and began doing things and going places. Several of us went to visit our families for the first time in a long time. One of the people died however, having been able to say their good-byes to their family. We were all happy for that person. Because of that death there was a change in bed partners. It wasn't necessarily same-gender bed sharing but there was no romantic or sexual activity either. I think over the course of the dream several people died, but they were all happy at the time of their death. This felt really good. I don't remember the exact transition of all the scenes. I was at this church. I don't recall my age. I was sitting in the pew not feeling well. I thought I was going to pass out. Just as I thought I was going to pass out, I saw myself slump over in the pew. I realized that I had died now also. The monsignor of the church was standing by my side. Even though he was alive, he could see me standing next to him. It was his job to help direct people who were newly crossing over from his church, so he had been given the gift by God to see the spirit of the person who had crossed, just as they had done so. He assigned them a spirit guide to lead them until the person was comfortable being on their own. Before I left with my spirit guide, the monsignor walked me around the inside parameter of the church. On the walls were banners in memory of those who had passed inside the church. He pointed out my banner. The banner said some very nice things about me. I didn't realize it was me, however, until he lifted it and showed me my name underneath. It was an incredible feeling. Especially as we floated into the air and overlooked the people and scenery beneath us. We floated over the cemetery. I saw Grandma F's headstone. I went to the ground and brushed away the grass and leaves. I spoke to her, hoping she would come out and speak with me, but she didn't. I was okay with that, thinking that it just wasn't meant to be, or at least not yet. I arose and continued floating around the cemetery. I saw Father F's headstone and went down to it. My spirit guide said that after passing we can have a wish come true that we know couldn't when we were alive. I really wanted to talk to Father F again so his spirit arose from the grave. My spirit guide left us alone. We had a wonderful chat. I went back inside the church and was looking at the banners again. This time I noticed one for BJ hanging there. There were a number of people/family members represented on her banner. I was surprised to see her banner. that she had died. But I also didn't know who all the people represented. The monsignor, who was now Father M, came up and told me that it was her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He also told me that she hadn't died yet, but that only I could see her banner as a sign that she would be joining me from that church. Her and her children came into the church for my funeral. They were very sad and I didn't want them to be sad for me. I was very happy. It felt wonderful to be free of the limitations and suffering of the physical body and a physical existence. God allowed her to see my spirit and communicate with her. It provided her with comfort, not only with my own crossing over but with the idea of her own eventual crossing. I did not tell her about her banner and what I knew about her crossing. I went back out to the cemetery for my burial. As I was hovering afterward, I saw my family wandering about the cemetery with the Kidwell family. Aunt A was pointing out that they had purchased burial spots so she, Uncle J, their children and their spouses, would all be buried together. I thought how unusual this was, at least according to the cemetery rules at St. Joe. I went back into the church. There was a mass going on and Father Marty was standing near an inside door. Another priest had just taken over as Monsignor of that parish. As I watched, I saw Father M's spirit leave his body. The new Monsignor directed him to me. I was to be his spirit guide. I welcomed him home. I took him around the parameter of the church and showed him the banners, and pointed out his own banner. I helped him get adjusted to floating. I took him to the cemetery. I told him about the ability to have one wish realized now that would not have been possible while in the physical body. Later, which must have been months or years later, I went to Father M's gravesite and saw that he was completely decomposed. All that remained were the things that he was buried in and with. Still, somehow, I was able to speak to him. I told him I wanted to be with him again, that I really missed him. He said, but don't you see, it's too late now!"
"0376"	"(2002-02-16)"	"I was in the garage of a house. I went outside to look at the address to figure out where I was. I saw the number on the house was 914. The name on the street sign was Field St. I realized that I was lucid so I ran back into the house to get a piece of paper to right it down so I wouldn't forget it when I woke up. I thought this might be my next home. When I went back out to look again and make sure I had it right, as happens in dreams every time I looked at the number on the house it changed. It kept changing up from 400. I couldn't read the street sign anymore but I remembered that it was field. I wanted to find out where the house was. I found a piece of paper. At first I thought it said it was in CI, then I saw PT on the paper. As I was headed back to the garage I was noticing how nicely the property was landscaped. Near the garage door was an evergreen that was dying, however. It was as though it had vertical stripes of brown dead branches all around it. I leaned over to click off the outdoor light by the cord hanging from it. I remember thinking that I needed to get the evergreen replaced. I noticed that there were lights on inside the house, but behind the garage. I went inside and back to those rooms to see what the rooms were and why the lights were on. There were three different rooms. The first one was a laundry room. The second one had bins in the wall kind of like a post office box on the street, where you pull it open and drop the mail in. One of the bins was for mail and the other was for trash. I thought it was so cool to have a mail drop box there like that. The third room had the same kind of bins but these were for recycling. They were small narrow rooms. I left and went into the main part of the house. I was wondering around in awe, with the thought that this was going to be my future home in waking life so I was very interested in looking around. As I entered the main part of the house from the garage it had a huge open foyer with a very high ceiling. Directly in front of me was a wide staircase with banister on both sides, centered in the foyer. The stairs were carpeted, a print, maybe oriental pattern. I started up the stairs to see the other floors and a woman came in the house. I didn't know what to say to her because I didn't know who she was. She seemed to be Mexican perhaps. I thought she might be the housekeeper. I don't know how but I realized that I was the housekeeper and she was the woman of the house. She was giving herself a facial, I suppose, because she appeared to have a green facial mask on. I asked her if I could speak with her. She took me up to the first landing and sat in a chair and I sat on the floor at her feet. I asked her for her thoughts about dreams and the truth of their messages. She agreed that dreams are important and often given us factual information. I told her that I had dreamt that I was going to be living in this house. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she ever thought about having a live-in housekeeper. I said I could do that and proceeded to tell her the benefits to her of doing that. She agreed to the arrangement. I asked if I could look at the rest of the rooms in the house. The house seemed to have several stories but perhaps just 2 or 3 rooms on each floor. The house was fairly large though. When I was approaching one set of two doors, she mentioned her son who had died young. These were his rooms. I looked in one room and there was nothing in there but a bed. She was talking about his awards and accomplishments and that she hadn't touched his rooms since his death. I went to the other door. I felt as though I was going to fall off the landing but I'm not sure why. The door opened up from the floor and there was nothing in there. It didn't even seem to be a room. I was trying to clean the dirt off the door as I held it up. still afraid of losing my balance and falling off the landing. We went back downstairs. I did not see a living room or any bathrooms in the house. We went into the kitchen. Someone else was there now. Someone that I knew but I can't name them. The owner was getting something to drink. She had become a soda machine and she was spinning in circles before pouring herself something to drink. After she turned back into a person I asked her why she spun around before pouring her drink and she said she does that to mix it up before pouring. I poured myself some juice in a glass that looked like a miniature brandy snifter. I saw two little girls playing in a window, inside the house. It almost looked like an empty store window. It was carpeted and well lit but empty, except for the two little girls playing there. I learned that the owner's two sisters lived with her as well and that the two children belonged to each of them. This made me think that Matthew might be able to come and live there as well. She was scolding her sisters about something and they were all preparing for bed. Three men came in to talk to the owner. She introduced me to them. One was responsible for the house, the other for the landscape, and the third oversaw everything. I reminded myself that I should tell the landscaper about the dying evergreen. She gave me a key to the house and told me that I could move in the next day but I would need to start early and be done between 3 and 5 in the afternoon. I told her that was not a problem, as my family would want to be finished by then anyway. I was thinking that I needed to hurry home and call them so they could get there early in the morning. She pointed out to me to clean up the glasses that the others had left sitting before I went to bed. We remembered that she had not yet shown me my room. We went upstairs and she unlocked the door to my room. It was as small as a closet. Room for one twin size bed and a dresser. It did not even have a closet in it. There was an alcove in which I thought another twin size bed might fit. I asked her about doing that so Matthew could stay there as well. I think I woke up before she answered me. I was walking around outside just looking at the house. I was thinking that I wasn't that crazy about the looks of it from the outside but that it was beautiful on the inside. I also didn't like that it was only a one-car garage. The outside was red brick and had no windows that could be seen from the front or the left side. The garage was on the right side of the house. It did have interesting lines. Standing in front of the house, facing it, it sat on a corner, with the cross street on the right side of the house."
"0377"	"(2002-02-16)"	"I was the daughter of a black family. We lived in a bad part of town. One of my brothers went out to play with his friends and we heard shooting. We all got down and got him back in the house. Mother and Daddy, but particularly Mother, was talking about the kind of friends my brother had. My parents were thinking about getting a new bed and then had one delivered to try out. There was hardly room for it in our small home/apartment. I'm not sure which it was. I had a room upstairs that I shared with siblings; I think both brothers and sisters. My brother had some of his friends over for a party. My parents had just gotten new carpet and his friends got peanut butter all over the carpet. I told him he needed to get it cleaned up before they got home but he didn't do anything. I worked on it some but quit. I don't know why. Some of his friends wanted to dance with me. Now I was a white person and his friends were white as well. I was supposed to choose one of his friends after I had danced with several of them. I chose one with long, dark, wavy hair and dark eyes. He had a very smooth, clear complexion and a very kind face. We hit it off pretty well. it was months later and a girl showed up saying she was the mother of this man's children. The children, however, were actually snakes. Real snakes. Two of them were huge. Very long and very big around. They almost looked like cobras as you noticed their hoods when they raised off the ground. There was also one much smaller snake. I didn't want anything to do with them. I hate snakes. I suppose I fear them. Anyway, I was told that I was now responsible for these snakes because I had chosen this man. But he decided he was no longer interested in me. A bunch of his friends were there but they all finally left, and left a huge mess. I noticed that the peanut butter stains were still there and I couldn't believe that my parents had let my brother get away with not cleaning them up. My parents decided that it was time to move into a bigger home. My mother designed a very contemporary and very large house. When we were ready to move we were taking things off the walls and packing. Every time I thought we were done I realized there were still many things on the walls that we had not taken down and packed. I especially noticed that I had missed plaques and things about Matthew and I wanted to be sure not to miss them. The neighbors had some mean dogs, maybe Dobermans. They kept coming into the old house and worrying us as we were trying to pack and move. When we got to the new house I couldn't find my room. I went into the house and it had a very strange type of spiral staircase. The spiral staircase reminds me of something you would see in a Dr. Seuss book. Very odd shaped, large, and bright colors. As I went up the staircase I kept finding bathrooms and I knew who they were for. Then I found some bedrooms and I knew who they were for. But I didn't find my room. I finally went and asked my mom and found out that she did not have a room put in for me. Now the family was black. I'm not sure if I was black or white at this point. I was very upset that I did not have a room and I didn't know where I was going to go or what I was going to do. I finally found my dad and told him what she did. He was upset and just shaking his head. He was and wasn't surprised by what she did. I know that I am not her daughter but I am his daughter. I think he is going to send me to live with a relative until he figures something out. My stepmother told me I could have one of the bathrooms because there were many more bathrooms in the house than there were people."
"0378"	"(2002-02-17)"	"I was in Wal-Mart and was looking for a computer keyboard with a touchpad mouse in the keyboard. One of the associates was. It looked like we were either in the toy or the hardware section. We found a black keyboard with half of what I was looking for attached to it. The shelf was coming away from the wall. The associate said they didn't have the rest of it. I was looking back behind that shelf to see if it had fallen down there. She took me to the front and was going to ask so I carried it with me but they didn't have the rest of it so I just gave it to her. I was going to leave and as I was getting ready to leave there were displays that I thought was computer equipment so I stopped to look there to see if they had one but they didn't. They had all of these black plastic cases. Kind of like a case that you would carry a slide projector or something in. They were all different sizes. I went outside and there was a construction company working on the parking lot. They wanted hardly any cars in the parking lot. They had piles of tar here and there that they hadn't smoothed out yet. I was trying to drive around them and stay out of their way. It seems like I did this twice but I don't know why. One time my car was more like a clothing rack on wheels, made of steel pipe like I used at SFI when preparing merchandise for the sales floor. I had to use it kind of like a skateboard. I was trying to go around these piles of tar and stay out of the way of the work trucks. I say Susan A. She said something to me about an event coming up."
"0379"	"(2002-02-23)"	"I was working for Doctor C at the SVSDC. Doctor W still worked there. I kept trying to avoid him because I didn't want him to see me there. I was wearing mauve colored scrubs with a white jacket with a colorful print. I worked for Doctor C not for SVSDC. I think I was in research. One time I went in to pick something up and the night tech."
"0380"	"(2002-02-24)"	"The characters on the show Seventh Heaven. Mary had been killed by a burglar. She joined a child that they had lost. The child was about a year younger or a year older than Mary. I can't remember her name now. Mary was visiting the different family members that she left. her husband and her children. She was visiting them frequently to watch over them and see what was going on with them."
"0381"	"(2002-02-27)"	"I was with a large group of people. We went to a prison to do one-on-one counseling with prisoners. I didn't know all the people in the group. Terri O and Audrey T and Karen W were all in the group. We had car-pooled. When we arrived and went inside we had to walk along this ledge. All of the walls had a ledge just a few inches off the floor and only about 4-5 inches wide. We had to walk on this ledge rather than on the floor. We were obviously in single file. When we each came to the person that we were supposed to be counseling then we would go into that cell. We had to climb up into the cell with the prisoner. I was the last one to get to the cell of the prisoner I was going to be working with. I was in a section that was all women. I had past one cell and I thought I past the one I was supposed to go into. Since I wasn't sure I backed up and looked at a sign on the wall to double check. Then I went back and climbed up into the cell with the woman I was supposed to be counseling. There were two women prisoners in that cell. The woman that I was counseling was in the middle of a visit with her five children. I don't remember a lot about the counseling session. Going into it I was somewhat concerned about doing one-on-one counseling with a prisoner. I wasn't sure that I was ready or qualified to do counseling with a prisoner. When we were ready to leave we had to walk on these ledges again. This time, when we were leaving, we got separated. Some of us got lost and were having trouble finding our way out. There was one point that we were walking by the prisoners but they were no longer in individual cells. They were in spaces that remind me of cubicles. There were 6-8 prisoners per cubicle. Half on each side of the cubicle. There were no doors or bars on the end. We were at a higher level than they were so we could see down into the cubicles and see them. Occasionally there were some standing. We finally found our way outside, but we weren't all together. When my group got outside we realized that there had been a breakout. The prisoner's who had broken out had guns so I scrambled to get into a car with some of the other counselors. I think there were five of us in that car. Karen W was driving. We just kept telling her to drive faster. There was a lot of shooting going on. I thought we should all be crouching down in the seats so we wouldn't be hit by bullets coming through the windows. But I didn't say what I was thinking. We did keep telling Karen W to drive faster. I didn't understand why she was hesitant to drive faster. With all the shooting going on, there was shrapnel falling on the roof of the car. As it was falling it was disintegrating the roof of the car. It wasn't coming through the roof, but more like melting it. There was black matter dripping down and landing on us, in our hair and on our faces and sticking. I don't remember that it hurt but I don't think it was going to come off very easily and I think I was concerned about it leaving scars or injuries. Now I was trying to get into a car with someone else. I did. As we were taking off I saw Audrey T running to get into a car. I kept saying that we needed to stop and let Audrey T get in but they wouldn't stop. They said, no, we just need to keep going. I was very upset with them about this. Karen W was driving. This is confusing. She wouldn't stop for Audrey T to get in. We got away. I don't know who I was with. I was with two black women that I don't know. We were out in the country. We came to a place where. I think we went to each of their homes. Each of their homes was like a very small wooden shack. maybe 8 ft by 8-ft square. They were very run down and full of stuff. One of them just had a couple of people in it and the other one had people sitting along all four walls. I was lying out in the grass. I woke up. I couldn't open my eyes all the way or couldn't see clearly. It was kind of like when I wake up and am having trouble with my contacts because I need to put drops in my eyes. I got up and started walking and I could feel the grass under my feet and how rough or uneven the ground was. I bent over and felt the grass and thought, oh, I'm awake. I started walking and then I saw two men walking up behind me. They had been with us at the prison. Now, though, we were all dressed up. They each had on suits. I thought we were all awake."
"0382"	"(2002-02-28)"	"I was on the beach in Hawaii near the ocean. I was talking to several people. I don't know who was there except for Kendall B. He was there with his wife and kids. There was some other man there as well. I was talking to them. Kendall B's wife and kids got up and left. I continued talking to Kendall B. He said, we have to be very careful here like this. I thought he meant that he didn't want to be seen talking to me with no one else around. So I got up and walked further up on the beach and sat down. Kendall B came back up to me and asked me why I had left. I said it was because of what he said about being careful. He said, that's not what I meant. This is very sketchy. We talked some about what he meant. I'm in my hotel room and he comes in and we talk some more. I went back out to the beach and the palm trees were very low and very thick. I had to push the branches away to get down to the ocean. There were other people around but I don't remember any of them. I spent a little time in the ocean. Either Kendall B and some of his family or just his family were there. I went back with them to their room. I spent time with all of them there. He had two young boys. I was playing with the boys and they asked me to spend the night with them. They were all sharing one bed. I said they didn't have room for me and his wife said, sure we do. So we were all lying horizontally across the bed. His two boys wanted me to sleep in between the two of them. I don't remember if I ended up staying there or not but I did lie down in the bed with his wife and the two boys.  "
"0383"	"(2002-02-28)"	"I went to the mall on a Sunday. Macy's was closed, but they had a door open so people could go through the store to get into the mall. It was dark in the store. As I was going through I noticed that they had one cashier working and one of the managers was there. They were letting people shop. The manager saw me and asked me if I would hang some signs for them. Apparently I was an employee but it was my day off. I was really irritated by this because I didn't want to do it because I didn't want to work on my day off. But I also didn't feel that I should say no. I grabbed the signs and I very hastily hung four signs. I didn't do it the way I would have, had I been on the clock. I ran out of tape. As I was getting ready to leave the manager said something to the employee. The employee explained how I had hung them. I had hung two facing in one direction and two facing in the opposite direction. I went out to the mall. There was a deli there. I decided to buy some ham and have it sliced. There was another woman there who was also buying ham and wanting to have it sliced for her own business. One of her hams was the size of a small person. She was dragging it on the floor and she had two smaller hams in her arms. I just had one small ham to have sliced but they made me wait until they were finished with her. So I set mine on the counter and decided to walk through the mall while I was waiting. As I walked through the mall I got lost. I got to one section that was all glass walls and doors that could be pushed open and shut. I got stuck in there. It was kind of like a maze. I was feeling panicky, as I would in such a situation in waking life due to claustrophobia probably. I finally stopped one and asked them to PLEASE help me to get out of there and back into the mall. She helped me to get out of there and back into the mall. But then I still couldn't remember which way I needed to go to get back to where I came in. So, I walked for a little while. I stopped someone else and asked for directions again. They gave me directions. I went up a ramp to one store that she had directed me to. The store was all unfinished furniture. The walls and floor were all the same kind and color of wood so it all blended together. I was walking through that store trying to find my way back out into the mall section that I wanted to be in. I couldn't find my way out so I had to stop someone else. I came to this counter and a man was working behind it. It was the actor that plays Dennis Finch on a weekly comedy program. I asked him for directions. As he was giving me directions he mentioned a place called Chow Chow's that sells great hotdogs. He said I would be walking by that. I said, Oh that sounds wonderful. I love hot dogs. I could really go for a good hotdog right now. Then I noticed that they were selling hotdogs in their store as well. I said, well, you have hotdogs. He made a sarcastic remark. I bought a hotdog from him. He didn't even ask me what I wanted on it. He was just putting all kinds of stuff on it that I wouldn't normally ask for, but I didn't stop him. I saw that they had desserts and asked what they were. One of them looked like a small bon-bon. They were telling me what it was and it was something very rich and exotic. I told them I would take one of them as well. I said, by the way, how much is it? He said, Ten dollars. I said, Ten dollars? I thought it must be really incredible so I was going to pay the ten dollars for it. He said, you're going to pay that? I said, if that's how much it costs. I thought it must be really wonderful to be worth ten dollars. He said, I was kidding you. Then I saw another kind of dessert and said I wanted that at first. He was taking his time fixing it. Kind of playing around. I had one near me and said, this one isn't full. I was still having trouble finding my way back. I finally did find my way back to the ham man. The first woman was gone but so was my ham. The man wasn't sure what I was talking about. I said, I bet you gave it to that other woman and he agreed that he probably had. I decided to just leave. I was in the CAS office. I was very sleepy and didn't want to drive home being so sleepy so I laid down on a sofa in the reception area to take a nap before I went home. While I was napping these other people kept coming in and I don't know who they were or why they were in there. They were Chinese. Maybe they were cleaning people but they had their children with them and the children were playing with some toys. They saw me there sleeping and were trying to be quiet. They didn't realize that I wasn't really asleep and knew what they were doing. I finally got up and said something to one of them because I couldn't get to sleep and I got frustrated. I did finally leave."
"0384"	"(2002-03-05)"	"I went down several flights of stairs with no handrail. That would normally be a little scary to me in waking life."
"0385"	"(2002-03-06)"	"I was on my way to the office and I was taking the route. I thought I was taking the route of K1 to 106th St. It seems that this is how this started. Then I was going up this road towards this path and I came up to an intersection. It was raining and there was something for me to step over as I crossed the intersection. I was thinking that I was looking for an intersection with a traffic light. I also remembered that I often miss that intersection and have to turn around and come back. That's what I did this time too. I turned around. I stepped off the path onto this farmer's property. As soon as the way was clear I got back on and headed back down. It seems as though when I stopped at the bottom of the path while I was talking to this man, there was somebody else behind me. He was also within earshot but I don't recall him participating in the conversation. The vehicle was like a sled but it has wheels instead of running blades. You can use it on any kind of surface or terrain. I was taking it for a ride, I guess is the best way to describe it. I went up this road and then go off onto a path that goes up a hill and then it leads into a park. From there I just picked it up and walked back to the car. When I was on my way to the path, I went to far and had to turn around and come back. When I turned around and came back, there was a fork or something and I took the wrong fork maybe. I was in this really wooded area. I was right along the edge. It was very narrow. There was hardly room to walk and I was on a kind of stone ledge. I could see the path just a few feet below me but too far to just jump off. I had to work my way backward to get back down on the road where I was supposed to be. Then I went back down to where I needed to be to go up the mountain path. I got to the bottom of the path. There was a man sitting there checking people in before they went up the hill. We were talking about exercise. I was talking about my blood pressure being so high and that being kind of dangerous. He warned there had just been a storm and that the path was rough right now. I thanked him for that. He was sitting there. I didn't want to get on my skateboard, for lack of a better description, where he could see me because I didn't want him to laugh or anything. I also had a blanket with me. Maybe I put the folded blanket on top of the sled to lay on. I started walking up this hill but it was so steep that I could hardly walk up. I would use my left foot to plan and then kind of pull my right foot up behind me. I had my left toes twisted towards the right, until I got out of sight from him. Then I was going to get on my skateboard, but the path. Some women came running down the path past me. The path was so full of leaves and branches and such that I had to keep walking. As I was walking I was using my hand to brush away the leaves and such off the path for anyone who came behind me. There was a tree trunk, a tree that had fallen. Instead of being across the path it was long the path the other way, leaving very little path to walk on. So I had to just keep walking. Then I came to a place there was a really big limb. I still couldn't ride. I had to keep walking. I got to a place where there was a big ball of plastic along the path attached to branches and stuff. I got it free and let it fall down the hill towards a house that was on the left at the bottom of the hill. I got past it. Right past that the path ended at a drop off. The drop off was very steep. The path was very narrow, almost had a point. Three sides around me dropped way down. I was really scared at that point. I was confused. I didn't know where to go. I couldn't believe that the storm had taken the path away. literally. It was a wide space between where I was and up ahead. There was no way you could even attempt to jump across. So I was looking around to try to decide what to do and was thinking about the situation. It was just unbelievable to me that this had happened. I turned around and I saw back and to my right some women were coming up towards the path that I was on. They were coming from a different direction. So I thought I would back down and then go off on the path where they were. But as I was backing down, there was so little path that I was very afraid of falling. I was looking for something to hold on to, to steady me. I reached for this branch with my left hand and then I was reaching for it with my right hand also and became very unbalanced. What I was reaching for wasn't there. The end of the branch that I was holding with my left hand just wasn't long enough to grab with my right hand too, but it was also pulling me forward a little bit."
"0386"	"(2002-03-07)"	"I was giving dream lectures as the guest speaker at an elementary school in a class. I did several in one day for a variety of ages. I also did one at a high school. No, I think this was a college class. One of the men was attracted to me but would not say anything to me. I don't know how or why I knew that. There was also another man that carried on like he was attracted to me but I think it was just a ploy to get me to help him with something he shouldn't be doing. We went to a reception. There were a lot of refreshments. The man who was just acting like he was interested in me kept trying to convince me to hold on to his marijuana joints for him. I didn't want to have anything to do with it. He kept trying to sneak it under plate somehow. I kept saying no. Someone else, I think one of the college personnel found it and this man told him that it belonged to me. I denied it and said it belonged to him and that he had been trying to get me to hold on to it so he wouldn't get caught. After that I went out to a parking lot but I don't remember what happened after that. I started going to this school's basketball games. The one man that I knew really was attracted to me but wouldn't say anything to me was on the team. First I thought he was a player but later he was the team mascot. Everybody loved him. I went to one of the games and there was a special section that I always sat in. For some reason the people who sat in that section were significant but I don't remember why. I went up to the registration table to find my seat. The man who was signing me in said there were only two seats available. I asked him who was on either side of the empty seats. He said that he was one of them. I said that's good. The other seat was saved for the man that was attracted to me. I was cheering through one of the games and then winning some games or that game. For some reason, this college man wasn't involved in the game anymore because of something that was going on. He was frustrated or discouraged. I finally talked him into participating again. This is the point where he became the team mascot. At the final game, he put on the mascot uniform and came running out onto the floor and everybody was cheering and ecstatic that he was back. It seems that maybe I dated this man and then got married. We did end up getting married. We were definitely soulmates. Very much alike in our values and our ideas and ideals, our philosophies about life. We could not have been better matched. It was quite wonderful. He was attractive. We lived in this very small house that was very run down. We had a very active sex life. Very passionate and intense and frequent. We were taking pictures of each other's genitals but I have no idea why. It was not for any erotic purpose. We were talking about the beauty of the human body, especially the genital area, and intrigue of how the male and female genitals were created so differently. We took the picture and wanted to get them developed but we found out it was going to cost us $12,000 to do that. Obviously, we didn't. I think we were going to use them for artwork. At this point I was the woman but watching the dream also. I was tired of the physical state of the house we were living in. I wanted to move into a bigger and a little bit nicer home. Nothing big and fancy but just not something that was so rundown and falling apart. I also wanted something just a bit bigger. This created quite a rift in our relationship because he was very content where we were. One of the things that was nice is that when we got married we were both so okay with living in that house. For some reason I changed and wanted to live in a bit bigger and nicer house."
"0387"	"(2002-03-08)"	"Many members of my family had come to the city where I live to attend my child support hearing with me. I was living in a house. It was just a series of problems. I was rushing around because I didn't want to be late. They were doing different things to slow me down or to impede my timeliness or schedule. I was living in a house, maybe in a house on Lakeland Dr. I was thinking about the laundry room and the backdoor there. BJ said something about me having a backdoor and I said, yes, we have a backdoor in the laundry room. She said something about it and I said, well, it's not like we hang out in the laundry room. We finally got in the car. Someone else was driving. I was sitting in the back seat and trying to give them directions. I could hardly see. They were driving really fast. They missed one turn. We got on, I think it was 82nd St. but it didn't look like 82nd St. in waking life. They were driving very fast and were in the wrong lane. Because they were in the wrong lane they ended up on I-70 and weren't supposed to be there. As soon as we realized what we had done we pulled off and started backing up through the median trying to get back where we wanted to be. There were some workmen who were just watching us. It didn't look like we were going to be able to get back. We couldn't get to the other lanes where we could head the other direction on the other road. We kept backing up and then we had intended to try to back up in the grass back on to 82nd St. Bill F, Brian F, Mother, BJ, Rachel S were all there. We all ended up in different places. I said, You left Rachel S alone? Brian F said, Well Bill F was going after her. I was just freaking out that they had done that. Rachel S is only 3. Several of us ended up on a boat headed somehow between the highways. Someone else was on something in front of us. We were pulling on this rope to move the boat forward and get us where we wanted to be. Whoever was in front of us joined us on the boat. We all ended up together, with Rachel S. While we were on this boat it was raining or storming. We had two things of candles and two plates with two pillar candles on each. Julie D was with us at this point. She was saying something about the candles being lit so I was trying to protect them from falling over and causing a fire or burning anyone. We finally ended up at the child support office where we were supposed to be. My attorney was trying to be very nice about my whole family being there but she realized that we shouldn't talk in front of them. She tried to find a place where she and I could talk privately. I pointed to two sofas that were positioned into an L shape. I suggested we sit there and talk. She said that was fine. Then she said No. Let's go to one of my associate's offices. So went there. I had the feeling that she was going to be very effective and that she was very understanding, sympathetic with my case, of the same beliefs."
"0388"	"(2002-03-09)"	"I was having a big fight over the phone with Darren about this child support issue. I wanted to try to resolve it. I wanted to try to make one final attempt to resolve it before going to court. His final comment was that he had told several people that he was just going to use a court appointed attorney."
"0389"	"(2002-03-09)"	"Some kind of romantic situation with Bill C."
"0390"	"(2002-03-09)"	"I had gone to see Doctor Pf. We were standing in the hallway outside of one of the exam rooms. I told him I was feeling so much better since I was back on my medications and I thanked him for that. He gave me the bill and I headed to the counter where I normally pay. It was as though I was having trouble seeing. That only lasted for a few seconds. When I got to the counter to pay I noticed that the bills were different. They were no longer the two part forms. It was just a regular piece of paper. He had not written any amount due. I handed it to the nurse and she said I could just hold on to the paper and pay the bill on-line if you want or she could take a check. I said that this would probably save their office a lot of money. She didn't say anything. I left and realized I didn't have my shoes on. I only had my socks on. I went back in to that window and realized that I had stepped out of my shoes while I was talking to her. I was trying to be inconspicuous because I didn't want to tell her what I did. I was kind of embarrassed. I stepped back into my shoes. As I was going back through the reception area there was a body of a bird lying there but it didn't have the head. It really bothered me. I was hoping that I wouldn't see the head lying somewhere as I headed to my car. I went to the car and for some reason I went back in again but I don't remember why now. As I was going back in, there was a multi-colored, fairly large bird. He was saying, This is bad. This is bad. Mommy's hurt. Mommy's hurt. It wasn't a parrot but the bird was speaking like a parrot. I went inside and I was going to say something to someone to see if they could help. Just as I got in one of the doctors went outside and he found another bird lying there. This was the mother bird. He said ohhh and then took it inside and tried to heal the bird. He did help and he later brought the mother bird back out. There were a bunch of children around watching the mother bird trying to get around again. I got ready to leave. It felt as though this was something I had done before. But for someone reason I felt that I couldn't back up or it would be too difficult or too much trouble. So, I went through the grass just a little bit to another part of the pavement to get back on the road. After I was back on the road I realized I was on the wrong road. I was going to turn around. Just as I was getting ready to turn around my car started dying so I managed to get into this driveway. Even though the engine didn't die I couldn't get the car to stop. So I kept trying to steer it. I went off into their grass but I finally got it to turn but I ended up in the driveway of another house. I kept turning and ended up back in the driveway of the original house and finally ended up back on the road but still headed in the wrong direction. All of the sudden the car started running again. I got to a place where I could turn around properly and go back and get back on the road going south the direction I was supposed to be going. Except that it didn't look like A1 Rd. South does in waking life. Nancy [unknown in waking life] and I were outside, maybe at McDonald's or something, though it didn't look like a waking life McDonald's. We were standing on a wood deck. Matthew went inside. Jennifer K came and met us. I got a call from Darren then."
"0391"	"(2002-03-10)"	"Sondra from IHC called me and asked me again to come in for an interview. When I got there, there were several other people in the reception area waiting for an interview for the same position. She was fussing over me being the ideal candidate. She finally took me back to Scott M's office for my interview and was going on to him about how I was the perfect candidate. We were talking about how I excel in operational issues and the connection between my studies and their purpose."
"0392"	"(2002-03-13)"	"I had back surgery. The cut was made from my lower back near my right side all the way up to the middle back of my neck. I was recuperating at my birth home. I don't recall if I was living there or not. I was trying to find someone place that I could be comfortable and not bored. I tried to lie on my stomach on the sofa but it wasn't comfortable. Someone suggested we open the sofa bed but I said no because that would block others from seeing the TV. I kept wanting to turn over on my back but either realized I couldn't or that I had to be very comfortable doing so. I woke up slightly as I was turning over in my own bed and still being in my dream I was very careful so as not to hurt my back. People were coming in and asking me about my surgery and I pointed out where the scar stopped and started. I went to a concert with some other people. We were going to hear the Dell's. I was concerned about being able to sit in the seats because of my back so I took my own chair with me. It was like the chairs in our training room. People were looking at me funny for bringing that chair with me, but I didn't pay much attention because I wanted to be able to be there. I sat my chair down where I had planned to listen to the concert and then left for a minute to get something. When I came back some people had moved my chair and were stretched out on the lawn where it had been. I said, wasn't this chair sitting here? They said yeah. Trying to act nonchalant and innocent. I just picked up the chair and moved their legs with the chair and put it back where I had it. After the concert was over I was standing by this chain link fence, the kind that you would see at a baseball field. I said hello to some people I recognized. Then I noticed Vince P walking towards me. He looked like he kind of wanted to avoid me. He came up to me on the other side of the fence and kind of leaned up to the fence and gave me a kiss through the fence. Very typical of Vince P. He started making excuses for not returning my calls."
"0393"	"(2002-03-16)"	"Mother called me at about 4:30 am. I answered but was having trouble hearing her. At first I thought she had said that Daddy died. Then I realized that she said he was in the hospital. that he had a stroke. It sounded as though the prognosis was not very good. I asked her about that. She seemed hesitant to answer me. I told her that I had been having dreams lately that something was going to happen soon. I didn't tell her that some of my dreams were waking intuitions. I've had lots of thoughts over the last months that daddy won't be around on the physical plane much longer. I am unclear if these are precognitive preparations or if they are reflections of my own thoughts and feelings. I somehow knew that I was the third of the six children that she had phoned to inform of this latest development. I was wondering about the implications of this stroke in light of his pacemaker and the fact that it is in constant action these days rather than jump starting his heart occasionally as it did when it was first implanted. I was also reflecting on his deteriorating health such as his shoulder and legs and that he can no longer have surgery because of the pacemaker. I decided that I needed to leave immediately to go down there. Matthew was still asleep and I decided to walk and let him come and get me later in the day before he headed back to school. They live an hour and a half drive away. It didn't seem to take me that long to get there. In fact, I was one of the first to arrive, even though I live the furthest away. Bill F, of course, was there. But he was the only one there. It didn't seem to be too long before the others had arrived. Mother was still at the hospital. It wasn't long before Mother arrived home, with Daddy in tow. They had released him from the hospital already saying that he was fine to come home already. We all visited for a brief time and then decided it was best for each of us to go home and let our parents get some rest. John S and Rachel S were there with Bev. They asked me about one of their girls spending some time with me. I confirmed that I have wanted both of them to come and spend the weekend. There was some discussion about Rachel S still being in diapers. She had some type of a rash or something and wasn't wearing a diaper or underwear at the time. We were all getting ready to leave. I put on my gloves and reached outside the back door to grab my boots and put them on. There was a lot of snow on the ground and it was quite cold. As John and Bev pulled away I waved at them to stop for a minute. Bev was sitting in the back with Rachel S. I asked them if they would at least drive me as far as the interstate so I would less distance to walk in the snow and cold. They questioned my request to be dropped at the interstate rather than Rt. 46, as walking on the interstate is illegal. I agreed that 46 would be better. I decided that when they stopped at the intersection I would get out there. BJ was getting ready to leave as well. I asked her if she didn't want to go through Brownsville to go home. I thought that would take some of the walking distance off as well. She said no and gave reasons for not wanting to. She didn't even ask why, or perhaps did not want to acknowledge why because she didn't want to appear harsh for saying no, given the reason that I was asking. I got in the car with Bev and John. As we drove towards the interstate there were lots of Christmas decorations all over around and in the streets. We were commenting how unusual this was for St. Joe. They obviously had invested a lot of money in these decorations. They were really quite beautiful. Some of them were in the middle of the streets with room for people to drive on either side of them. Others were lined along the streets, seeming to sit in wood shelves. Others were in the center of circles and lined around the outside of the circles as well. it seemed as though I was outside of the van because I was brushing snow off the top of the decorations. John and Bev had dropped me off but I was still inside of this massive Christmas display. It was like a maze to me and I didn't know how to get out to get where I wanted to be. I kept trying different paths but to no avail. It was like one long display with halls going off to both the right and the left at equally spaced intervals. Some of the halls were dead ends. Others led further into a maze. Still others led to the outside, though not necessarily where I wanted to be outside. Many parts of the display were mobile. the walking path was as though it was a treadmill, or people mover. in the display I saw something spinning around in front of me. I stopped to get a clearer look. It appeared as thought three people were part of this display and spinning with it. I realized that two of the people were simply forms of people but the third was an actual person. It was Bill W. I reached out to try to get his attention, although it was spinning very fast. He stopped and got off. I told him I couldn't find my way out. He offered to help me by giving me directions. I followed his directions and at times found my way out, but still not where I wanted to be. Sometimes it seemed as though the path was blocked but you were supposed to push ahead and the display items would purposefully fall like dominoes to allow you to exit. Even this did not work. when I exited is where I saw the first circular display I mentioned above. It was breathtaking. It included evergreens and poinsettias, all touched by fresh-fallen snow. I moved around the circle trying to find my way. People were supposed to place something from the previous display in the circular display. I found myself back inside the maze with Mother and Daddy. I was trying to make it easier for Daddy as I was concerned about his health. I told him that Bill W had tried to help me. I was with someone else. a woman friend. We were trying to find our way out. It was pointed out to us that there was a pattern on the path and that if we counted a certain number of patterns that we would find out way out. So, for example, once we identified the first 24 squares, we could take either the right or left path and it would lead us to the outside. We tried it and realized that it was accurate. At this point this maze seemed to be just that. something set up as a display/entertainment for the local people and they would enter specifically for that purpose. From the outside it looked like a carnival tent. I noted that they had it closely sealed off everywhere, even the ground. One of the men responsible for it said they had to do that to make sure no outside light got in and that no one could see out. My friend and I decided to go back in and try to get back out using a different pattern. This time we decided to count ovals. Unfortunately the shapes were in the form of sunglasses so we could easily identify the ovals. Still, when she followed my counting we made it back out. At some points I was feeling panicky and stressed because I couldn't get out."
"0394"	"(2002-03-18)"	"Brush with Death I was in a hospital."
"0395"	"(2002-03-18)"	"I had just gotten a new dog. It was full-grown yet very small, maybe 4-5 pounds max. It was white. Perhaps a poodle. I called it Inga. When Matthew asked me how I arrived at that name I said in go the information and out come the knowledge. In go. Inga. Matthew and I were in bed asleep. I reached for Inga and she wasn't there. I wondered if I had just dreamt her or if I really had this dog. I got up and walked around the house looking for her. At this point I was in my birth home"
"0396"	"(2002-03-18)"	"I had built a new home on the property where Grandma F's house used to be."
"0397"	"(2002-03-23)"	"I was sharing a hotel room with a woman. [unknown] I don't know if I knew her in the dream either. We were getting ready to check out. We were packing. She got packed very quickly and was waiting for me. We were going to go out together. Someone else came in the room that was in our group, I guess. They chatted for a little while and were teasing me about how much I had to pack. Everything was not folded yet or anything. I had wet bath towels. I said something about how I was obviously not going to do laundry before I went because of lack of time. So I was just going to take everything home wet. The towels and everything. The other person left and I was just going to throw everything in the suitcase the way it was. This person that I had been rooming with started folding things for me. I started collecting my things while she was folding. She commented on a couple of pair of shorts that I had. that they were nice. I said, yes, that's one of the advantages of having a teenage son. Every time he doesn't want something anymore he just gives it to me. She said, that's a nice way to get some nice clothes. I continued packing. It was taking me awhile. Now Brian F was in the room. While I was collecting my toiletries in the bathroom, I noticed my roommate had left a lot of things in there. I said something to her but she said she was just leaving it. I went to the dresser in the room and found more of her things. Again she said she was just leaving them. I went back into the bathroom. Brian F apparently got tired of waiting and he and my roommate decided to go ahead and leave. I got a little bit upset because I knew if Brian F wasn't there she would have waited for me. So I was just kind of short with them and said, no, that's fine. Just go ahead and go. I finished up and went down. At this point I think I was in Banff because I was with my CIISC. Mary Kay C, Karyn L, Bonnie K, and others were starting to say goodbye. We were crying. It was hard to say goodbye. It was especially hard for me to say goodbye to Carmen A. Her and I hugged for a long time. I was taking my suitcases out. I had this cart and it had two bales of hay on it. I had to push it through the grass to get to where I needed to go. As I did that one of the bales of hay fell out. There was a man sitting out front that was supposed to be part of the hotel's display. He was a model. When he saw the bale of hay fall off, he got up to help. He took a bale of straw from his sleigh and put it up there. I told him he couldn't put it up there because it was straw. He didn't know what the difference was. He put it down. He grabbed something else and put it up there. Again, I said, no, that's straw too. You can't put that up there. So I grabbed a bale of hay and put it up there. I finally went into the room where some of the cohort members were. We were waiting in this space. We had to climb up into this very small space. I was feeling very uncomfortable because I am claustrophobic. I was also unsure that I could fit through these small spaces. I stayed on this ladder and looked in. It was very full. There wasn't any room for me anyway. I saw my roommate in there with Brian F. I said something about needing to leave soon. She said, Why? We have almost two hours. I said, yes, but I was told we needed to be at the airport two hours in advance. She said, well, my agent said one hour in advance was fine. Brian F agreed with her. There wasn't a lot I could do. Sometime before that I was talking to people about flights. I had a 5:15 am flight so we needed to be at the airport at 3:15, which meant we needed to leave the hotel by 2:45. So I think we decided just to stay up and not even try to sleep before then. Terri O said something about how early the flight was. I think when we were having that discussion we were in a small meeting space together. We were all sitting around on the floor. I'm not sure what we were doing. When I was standing on this ladder and just after I said that, someone said that we all needed to get on the bus that they were taking us all on the bus at the same time to the airport. I was kind of relieved that we were going to go ahead and go early. For some reason now I was one of the last ones to get on the bus. I know I had a lot of luggage. My roommate kept saying something to me about my one piece of luggage. She kept saying that I would have to check it and I said I wouldn't. She said, well you know they have to fit under the seat. They are very strict about that. I said, yes, I know. And it does. She said this a couple of times. I said, I've used this before and taken it onboard with me. She finally walked away, but in a snit. As we were getting on the bus I was concerned that all my luggage had gotten on there. Brian F and I were the last ones. They were starting to pull away. Brian F jumped on the back of this pickup truck and was just holding on. I was running along. He kept telling me to go somewhere else. I finally said, Brian F, would you just grab my hand and help me get on? He did. At this point everyone was in trucks instead of buses. Well, some kind of truck like vehicles. It seemed that they were attached or something, kind of like a train would be. But they were all open so we could still talk to each other. Someone on the inside about being so uncomfortable. I said, well, at least it's better than this. I can just barely hang on riding on the outside of this truck. I was concerned because I had hardly anything to stand on or to hold on to. I was concerned about going around turns and hills and things. We were at the airport and getting our luggage to go check in. I couldn't find my purse. I was panicking. I was going different places to see if anyone had turned it in. We saw a couple sitting different places. We looked at them but they weren't mine. Then I saw one that looked almost exactly like mine but realized it was just a tad different. I finally realized I was just going to have to try to do without it. I was sitting in the airport waiting. I was sitting next to this young boy, maybe 10-12 years old. He had a marker and was drawing pictures on his leg. I must have bumped him. Or at least he blamed me for causing him to mess up what he was drawing on his leg. So we talked a little bit. I asked him if he wanted to see me draw something on my leg. He said sure and handed me the marker. It was brown, so I drew a Herman on my leg. He liked that. Then I drew a picture of a woman's face. Everyone thought that was very good. When we were in the trucks there was a box that had all these markers and things in it. I was asking who they belonged to. People didn't agree with each other on who they belonged to. I said it sure looks like the markers and things that belong to the cohort. I said, They were in a plastic container. Someone else said, yes, but someone took them out of the plastic container and put a bunch of socks in the container. This bothered me a bit that they had done that."
"0398"	"(2002-03-24)"	"A lot of very intense anger on my part. "
"0399"	"(2002-03-25)"	"A lot or relatives from the Harris family had come to my birth home to visit me. It was mostly women and children. Joan W. was there. The only male I remember being there was Larry K. The women had come to see me because they knew that I had been through some kind of trauma and they were coming to offer support and comfort. They came because my immediate family would likely not be offering any type of support and comfort. Particularly, Aunt P and Aunt H were trying to be comforting. I went out to the woods and someone was out there with Larry. They were playing games with the children. I played with them for a few minutes and then went back in to the house. I was in the bathroom and could see several people standing right outside the bathroom window. I was moving around cautiously because I didn't want anyone to see me in there. Matthew and I are in some kind of a vehicle, in seems to be a car. We are driving down to my mother's hometown because I decided I wanted to go down and talk to Aunt P and Aunt H. I decided to go down and see them because I had a dream about them. As we were driving down there we saw Aunt H walking towards us. We stopped and turned around. I yelled out the window, hey, you want a ride. She said, Sure. She walked around the car and got in. She was on her way to work at Kentucky Fried Chicken. I told her I was on my way down to see her and Aunt P. She asked why. I said I had a dream that I had talked to them and since I honored my dream I decided I should come down and talk to you. So we went ahead and took her to work but it turned out that she didn't have to work. We headed back to her house but now we were in some other kind of vehicle. It was shaped kind of like a luge but it ran on something like railroad tracks and it was open. It was almost more like a half of a pipe, enclosed on both ends. Matthew and I were sitting on it. Somehow we had to use our hands or our legs to make it go. Aunt H or Aunt P was going to go with us but there wasn't room inside for them. Then Mother was there. I didn't want to go then because I can't talk to them as freely if Mother is there."
"0400"	"(2002-03-30)"	"I had series of nightmares. Every time I was trying to call out to Matthew and trying to wake myself up and I couldn't. Sometimes I would think I was awake and that he was sitting by the bed and then he would not be there all of a sudden. The last time I didn't think I was dreaming. I thought I was just half-asleep. It felt as though someone was pressing on my mattress or sitting on it. I couldn't open my eyes to look and I also couldn't speak. I tried to say Matthew's name and I couldn't. I was getting more and more frightened. I kept trying to call out to Matthew and I couldn't. He was home from college during this time. I was trying to bang on the bedside table to get his attention and that wasn't working. I was having trouble controlling my arms to do that effectively. I actually thought I was awake at this point. I grabbed my clock radio and tried to turn the volume all the way up. I couldn't get it to play very loud because I couldn't get it tuned in clearly to one station. I kept trying and trying to call Matthew. I was finally successful. It came out, in waking life, as a shriek. He said it sounded like a ghost and at first he was afraid to come out of his room. "
"0401"	"(2002-03-30)"	"I took in a roommate. She was a black woman about my age. During the day she babysat children here in our apartment for a living. She was also a very good cook. She had people over for meals. I said this would work out great because I don't like to cook. We decided that she would do all the cooking in exchange for me cleaning the bathrooms. For some reason I headed upstairs to my bedroom. She had gotten rid of all of my furniture and personal items, everything that I had hanging on the walls. She had replaced it all with all of her own things. It was all an African-American motif. She had even had some remodeling done without my knowledge. I was very upset by this. Partially because we hadn't discussed this but also because she got rid of all of my things. She simply took over all the space and left no space for Matt Or me. When I went back downstairs I realized that she had done it there as well. I was speaking with one of her relatives. This relative said it just wasn't right that she had done that and I was just going to have to break our agreement and tell her that she was going to have to move out. The relative said she wouldn't change. that it would be her way or no way with her. I told her and she was very upset but she got all of her things out right away. I don't know if I hired an attorney or what. Someone heard about what had happened and had gotten different stores to give me all new furniture, new carpet. It was Beautiful cherry wood furniture. The latest in technology. radios, TV, computer, etc. Some of her relatives stayed around and was helping me get settled. They were very nice. They felt very bad about what this woman had done to me. When they got ready to leave they all hugged me, wished me well, and apologized again for this woman's behavior."
"0402"	"(2002-03-31)"	"I sense a lot of strong emotion. I was in some kind of relationship with Wes S, or maybe it was exploring a relationship, walking away and coming back to it. There was a weather disaster involved, maybe a hurricane and or a flood. There was another couple involved. I think there were two children."
"0403"	"(2002-04-01)"	"I was at work. We had people coming in for the Executive Seminar. Vince P was one of the people who showed up. I was very surprised and said something to him. He said, well, you should have known that I would be here for you. I thought this was odd because he hasn't returned my last couple of phone calls."
"0404"	"(2002-04-18)"	"I was myself as a little girl, still living at home. It was before Bill F, Brian F, or Bev was born. It wasn't my actual birth home. It seemed to be even more out in the country than where we actually lived. There was something going on with horses. Daddy and I went to this barn to check on our horse. He said something about Grandpa F's horse being there. I said, You mean Grandpa F is here? I knew Grandpa F was dead and that if he was there it was only in spirit. Daddy said, yeah, he's back there. He's sitting on the other side of his horse. One thing that was very strange about this dream was that others saw me as a little girl, I knew that I was my current age and they were just seeing me differently. I had never experienced this before."
"0405"	"(2002-04-19)"	"I attended a class reunion at my high school, ECHS. The reunion began with introductions in the auditorium, though the auditorium did not look like the waking life auditorium. Liz C was there leading the program and introductions. When I first came in I sat near the back and alone. There weren't many people there yet and I didn't know the ones who were there well enough to say hello or sit with them. I saw someone come in that I thought was Audrey T. She sat a few rows in front of me. She introduced herself to the group as Audrey T but did not mention her academic activity. I stood up and said something because I thought she should be recognized for it. A little later this person stood up and turned around to get my attention to tell me she wasn't the same Audrey T. Later in the program I was sitting closer to the front and to the left of the stage, left facing the stage. Audrey T and Paulette W were sitting next to me. Audrey T good-naturedly asked me about it. I apologized and said, you wouldn't believe what I did. I'm the absent-minded professor. Paulette W said, me too. That's what people call me. I said, That's what I tell people to call me also. It's the most comfortable explanation I have found for the silly mistakes I too often make. I explained about thinking she was another Audrey T. It was my turn to introduce myself. I jokingly said, are you sure you're ready for me? I talked about my dream work, my studies, and my future goal to write and do research. Everyone cheered and clapped. They were excited that we were finally going to have a Dr from our class. I went back to the back of the auditorium again and was talking to some of the men who weren't participating much, actually nodding off, that I knew and generally speak with at reunions. Don St, Bill Cra, Joe L, and Mike Kn. We joked a little at their lack of participation. As I was sitting there Darren came up and said hello. I said hello and walked away. In the meantime, some of us were dancing. Dwight W had introduced me to his wife and asked me to dance. I danced twice with Dwight W. He became aroused while we danced and was trying to make sure no one noticed. During the second dance he wasn't as careful and some of the other men noticed. His wife became a little agitated. I went up to her and spoke to her and apologized and smoothed things over. She realized I did not do anything intentionally. Paulette W was chasing after me, bullying me, trying to coerce me into doing something I didn't want to do. As in high school, I didn't have the courage to stand my ground and say no, so I did as she had asked. I put on part of the school mascot uniform and was walking around the school with others doing similar things. There were maybe 12-20 of us. One of the teachers came up to us and told us we had violated his classroom and demanded that we make amends. The task he gave us to do seemed to take quite awhile. When we finally finished and went to the cafeteria, almost everyone was gone. Soon people came back into the cafeteria saying they had just left for a little while. The reunion was not over at all. Later Darren was provoking me on purpose, with some of his buddies. I was getting very aggravated. At this point I'm not sure where we were in the school. He seemed to be on a lower level than I and I was peering down at him from a balcony of sorts. I had a pole or something in my hand and I swung it at him to get him to stop. It hit him in the neck and I thought I might have killed him. Someone went up to him and his head broke off. The man said I couldn't have helped it because he was frozen solid and of course his head would just break off like that. I wanted to call 911 immediately and see if they could save him. Everyone else thought it was useless but there were mixed feelings about how to handle it. Some wanted to call 911 and the police and simply report what had happened as it was an accident. Others, including Dwight W, wanted to hide the whole thing because they wanted to protect me. I was simply walking around in a daze. I couldn't believe what had happened. I just kept thinking that I killed my son's dad and that I was going to have to tell him that his dad is dead. All of the men there, though arguing, began to try to cover up what happened. In the meantime, police arrived and wanted to know what was going on. They kept trying to question me, but I was in a daze and could not even think or speak. I was simply walking around in this daze and trying to get out and go home without even thinking about that being my purpose or why I wanted to do that. Dwight W kept trying to get me out of there but the police kept seeing me and trying to keep me in the school. The men had put up very large pieces of cardboard all over the place in what seemed to be a basement, trying to hide any evidence and trying to hide Darren's body. It felt like a maze down there. I kept getting lost. I would find a way out and then someone would spot me and pull me back in. Sometimes I would actually get outside but had something like a medical bed to get home on and had to power it myself. I was trying to find the best way home to not be spotted. Still I would end up back in the basement. This happened too many times to count. Some of the ways out were square openings in the wall that I needed to crawl through to get out. Then I began getting lost. I could no longer find the ways out that I had found earlier. The square openings I found were much too small for me to crawl through. When I found one Dwight W was standing there and encouraging me to go through, thinking that I could fit. I told him there was no way I could. The square was maybe 12 inches square or less. The fact that a death had occurred had finally become known to the authorities, though they could not get any details from anyone and could not find the body. They brought in a large crew of people and began emptying everything out of the basement in an attempt to find the body and evidence. They had me help load cardboard and stuff into trashcans to be taking outside. I continued to try to find a way out and would keep getting pulled back in. Dwight W and some of the others were moving larger things out, such as large racks of luggage and mattresses. This one woman directed me to begin emptying the racks of graduation gowns into trashcans. She said they all needed to be destroyed now. There were a couple of times that I simply tried to hide behind the cardboard or the luggage or mattresses. Dwight W was afraid I would be found and wanted me to get out of the school. Because of the state I was in the authorities decided to allow one of my sisters to come and get me and take me home. When we were outside another of my sisters came running up with some of her friends and was told what happened. Neither my sisters nor their friends could believe that I had done such a thing with intent to kill. I found myself back in the basement cleaning up and putting the gowns in the trashcans. As I was doing this I realized they were coming very close to finding the body. I decided that, regardless of what the others thought, I was going to tell the authorities what I knew about what actually happened. I went outside and found the women who had been giving me directions and she took me to the man who would take my statement. I asked if I could give it in a private area rather than with all those people around. He was very warm and kind and told me not to be frightened."
"0406"	"(2002-05-04)"	"I was at my birth home. Some of my family members were there. I played in the backyard a little bit with Rachel S on the swings. She was laying with her stomach on the swing. There was another little girl swinging right next to her. I was afraid they were going to hit each other because the other little girl wasn't swinging straight. I went towards the house. We were building a new house next door for Uncle E. I had asked them to leave certain jobs for me to do because they were things I really enjoy and that I knew I could do them well. But then I kept not getting around to them and I was feeling guilty because I had committed to these things and asked the others to save them for me yet I wasn't getting around to them. This whole image of building a new house for Uncle E and my concern about these jobs that I had committed too. This time I went in to the house we were building. I was going to start painting. I realized that the last time I had painted I had left the paint can open. I was afraid the paint wouldn't be good any longer. But Mother went in and just picked up a roller and started painting, so I guess the paint was fine. She asked me how much I still had to do. I told her that Daddy said I had to do ten coats. There were spots all over the walls where I had done trim and prep work. Mother pointed out that I hadn't done along the ceiling yet. I acknowledged that. But I also said that trim is easy when the walls and the ceiling are the same color I knew Bev was sitting alone in the backyard so I went and asked her if she likes to paint. She said yes and came in to help. Brian F was also in there painting. We were painting a light green over a dark green. It was very dark in there and I was having trouble seeing. The others weren't complaining. Daddy brought me a light but it didn't help that much. only in very small areas at a time and I couldn't move it around easily. This was a very big room. They were not even finished constructing the interior walls, so it was very odd that we were painting already. I started to paint around a light switch. I got paint all over the switch plate. I was trying to wipe the paint off. I decided to find a screwdriver and remove all the switch plates. Mari Kate S asked me why I wanted to do that and I told her that it is much easier to paint around those areas if you remove the switch plates first. I removed the screws and switch plate that I had just painted over but I dropped three of the four screws. I was getting very agitated trying to find the screws that I dropped or trying to find replacements. I kept walking around and around the room, looking through piles of stuff lying all over the floor trying to find these screws. The main part of the dream was me just going over and over and over trying to find screws. I was having trouble getting around. There were a lot of chairs in there and I really just wanted to clear it all out so I had room to move but it didn't seem to be bothering anyone else. There was talk about having dinner because we had been working for quite awhile. Someone mentioned having burgers. I wanted chicken. Someone mentioned Kentucky Fried Chicken. The majority wanted that then but my parents would never eat that."
"0407"	"(2002-05-05)"	"I think everyone that was working on the house was getting really tired. Some of the construction workers started drinking and some of them got very much out of control. Some of them were coming on to me, but some simply because they were drunk and one or two were earnest in their affection. A lot of them were getting very boisterous and acting very rowdy and inappropriate, taking their clothes off and such. I decided to try to get away from the mess. I headed to my car but was afraid to go all the way to my car because of some of the men around it and because some of the drunken workers were driving their cars around there like maniacs and I didn't want to get hit. I also had Rachel S with me. Someone offered to walk me to my car but then they almost got hit. Another woman arrived and offered to let me use her car. We had to do something with child car seats. A very heavy rain came and was causing a small flood. Some of the cars were halfway deep in water. I was trying to get away. Someone gave me a parachute and walked with me, there was a group of us, to this bridge. We had to jump off the bridge and then open our parachutes. We couldn't see anything but clouds below us so we had no idea what we were jumping into. Some of them were scared because I opened my parachute too soon. I think I was holding Rachel S while I did this. I landed just fine. Then we had to jump into these boats on this river. I did that with no problem. There were lots of dishes, and decorative items floating in the water. I saw people gathering things. I gathered a few items. Just as I was getting ready to get out of the boat I learned that we were allowed to keep anything we gathered. I was disappointed that I had not gathered more. I didn't seem to have Rachel S any longer. I asked how to let the boat know when I needed to get off to get to my car. Now my car was in a different lot and it was daylight. Someone told me to pull on something and then would slow and pull to shore. I got off and walked about two blocks to my car. I was back to where I had to jump in the boat in the river. This time I knew about gathering things so I was able to gather up quite a few things. One woman gave me her car keys and instructed me to go get her car and pull it up to where the boat would pull to shore so we could easily load up all the things we gathered. Anyway, she got in trouble for parking her car somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be. They let me off the hook when they realized I didn't know anything about it, that I was just trying to do her a favor by coming to get her car."
"0408"	"(2002-05-05)"	"I think it was Matthew and I moving back to Lakeland Dr. I think I went to the owners of the home we used to own there and asked them if I could go in and look around. We went in and I was amazed at all the changes. They had gotten rid of the laundry room and the large deck we had built on the back. They had also put in a basement. I don't know how you add a basement to an existing house. For some reason the neighbors didn't want to accept me. the neighborhood seemed very nice, just as it was in waking life. At another point it seemed like it was very rundown and dangerous. At another point in seemed almost cartoonish in things that were in the street etc. At another point I was either a part of family that lived there or maybe a friend or simply an observer. The adult male in the family was prone to violence. The family members often tried to avoid him or hide from him when they felt he was dangerous. For some reason I didn't shy away from him. I seemed to be the one that was able to manage him and help him through his anger without hurting anyone."
"0409"	"(2002-05-14)"	"I was very excited to see Uncle A. I was at St. Joseph church. The church had hardwood flooring. The majority of the floor was raised about three steps. When you entered the main part of the church you had to go up 2-3 steps to get to the pews. For some events they would move the pews back, or around, to make the floor more like a stage. They had moved all the pews to the back of the church and the lowest level. Father came back near the pews but remained on the top level. When I came in I saw Uncle A and Aunt J sitting in one of the pews. I was so excited to see him. I immediately went and sat next to him and told him how long I had been waiting for this and I had so much to say and so many things I wanted to ask him. I apologized over and over for not being at his funeral and told him how badly I have always felt about that."

"0412"	"(2002-05-15)"	"I was at an intensive. I couldn't room with Carmen A because she was rooming with Lorna B. I don't know why I wasn't rooming with Jo V. I was rooming with two new cohort members. I had to share a bed with one of them and that person didn't like me. She was being very mean to me in the room and I heard she was saying some very ugly things about me in group sessions. One of the things that she said, apparently standing in front of the entire group at a program, Who does that woman think she is? How dare she talk about articulating something related to dreams. Though those weren't her exact words. I was feeling very upset that she was attacking me like that, both in the room and in front of any groups of people. One time I went to the room, I was going to bed early because I wasn't feeling well. I turned the heat up because I was cold. I put on my flannel pajamas, grabbed an extra blanket and proceeded to get in bed. As soon as I got in bed she turned the heat back down. She started verbally attacking me to face then. I decided to get up and leave the room so I went into the bathroom. I partially changed my clothes so I could go out. I went out into the hallway and get a Diet Sprite. I saw Terri O. She noticed I was crying and asked me if everything was okay. I said yes. She knew better because she could see I was crying and upset. But she just cheerfully said okay and started to walk away. I was really surprised and hurt by that. I did want to talk to someone about what was going on. Then I saw Mary Kay C and Karyn L and told them what was going on. Unfortunately they already knew because they had been in one of the programs where she had made one of her comments. Karen W and Julie S were also aware of what was going. On my way back to my room Karyn L and Karen W were standing together and whispering. I made some sarcastic remark because I felt they must have been talking about me because they quit talking as soon as they saw me. I said, That's right Karen W. I said some other thing, but the rest wasn't very nice. I had seen Karen W and Julie S in my room earlier with this other woman. I thought they might agree with her. I went back to my room. Karen W and Julie S came into my room a few minutes later. They weren't doing or saying anything to defend me."
"0413"	"(2002-05-16)"	"I was back at the old house on Lakeland Drive for a visit. I looked out the patio door and saw that they had removed the deck. I went to the backdoor in the laundry room and opened it. They had made the yard much higher, the height of the door, both to the left and to the front of the door. You could step out about 3 or 4 feet. In the grass directly in front of the door there were cement strips. They were about 5 feet long and only about 6 inches wide. They went to the top of the yard and had about 12 inches of grass between each one. I tried to use them to step up and see the yard but wasn't successful because they weren't wide enough. I stepped back inside and tried to close the door and saw a snake hanging from the top of the door. I grabbed something and tried to knock it off and to the outside and close the door quickly but there was another. I swung at it a couple of times and couldn't knock it out. As the dream progressed there were snakes everywhere in the house. I don't like snakes at all so I was panicking and terribly frightened by all of these snakes."
"0414"	"(2002-05-16)"	"I went to the BE Retreat Center for an appointment with Sister Toni. As I was walking in I realized I had left my planner in the car and would need it to schedule my next appointment. I turned around to go back to my car and I couldn't remember where I had parked. the parking lot was different than in waking life. There were three rows for parking. I couldn't remember the correct row or position in the row. I guess I just decided to forget it and go on in. I entered the building and was waiting in Sister's office for my appointment. Various people came in and out. Susan J was there. She was laying in the fetal position, facing the wall, in a corner of the room by the desk. I was sitting at the desk at this point. She was crying and very upset. Someone told me that someone close to her had recently died. I recognized the name, though I don't remember the name actually being used in the dream. I said, No wonder she is so upset. Still I could not recall her relationship with this person, only that she had been very close to him. It was a male. I knew it was not her husband. I questioned if it might have been her brother or her son. Her daughter also came to mind, but I think only to help me place Susan J's son. Doctor W came in the office. He saw me but did not say a word, acknowledge me, or anything. He simply laid something on the desk, turned, and walked out. I was so relieved as I did not want to have any kind of uncomfortable exchange with him."
"0415"	"(2002-05-17)"	"Nick R called and said he wanted to come back. As usual he was apologizing profusely etc. I told him no and reinforced why I was saying no by reminding him of things that we had both discussed before. He said he was coming anyway. I told him I would not let him in. He arrived and broke into the house. I was in bed. He came up to my bedroom and lay down next to me in bed. I told him he had to leave, that I did not want him there. I was half-asleep and had trouble waking myself up. He had undressed before getting into bed. I finally became fully awake and got out of bed. He chased me around the bedroom a bit, thinking I was playing around I guess, but I wasn't. I went downstairs and was becoming frightened. I asked him repeatedly to leave but he refused. Matthew showed up but he was much younger than in waking life. I managed to get into the kitchen and I pulled out a butcher knife. I handed it to Matthew to use if he had to, while I tried to call 911. I couldn't get through to 911. I tried several times. In the meantime, Matthew had stabbed Nick R 3 or 4 times in the stomach. Nick R just looked down at Matthew with the knife still in his stomach. Nick R is laying on the floor, but still alive. Matthew and I are upstairs and I decide to just call the local sheriff's office. Before they could arrive Nick R managed to get up and leave the house. He got in his car and drove away very fast. The next time my dream group met I felt I needed to tell them what happened in case Nick R should show up again, and also to explain my current state of being, nervousness. Two people got up and left immediately without a word. One of them was Alice S from my church. The others left at the end of the group time as usual. None of them seemed particularly concerned for me or for themselves. I was relieved that they weren't concerned about being there, returning, or that Nick R might be outside. I was curious that none of them, particularly Dan M, seemed concerned about me. I am in a very futuristic building. I don't remember how I got there. Some of the people there had the ability to what seemed to be simply move through the walls or through unusual openings in the walls. They moved me and some others into different areas, like small compartments. We were paired up in no particular order. I was in a compartment with a young woman and we were instructed to take our clothes off. She was a young black woman. She started to dance. All of a sudden they burst in and she was gone. They accused me of being a tease and that I provoked Nick R. They took me to a room where he was recuperating. This wasn't a hospital though. I went into the room to talk to him. There was a lot there but it was so unusual that it may be very difficult to describe. Somehow Nick R and I realized we had both been set up. We talked things out and decided to work together against these people to try to escape and to try to stop their actions against others. They had a, for lack of a better term, futuristic factory. They were either manufacturing people, or rejuvenating live people. One of them was my Aunt A who is still alive but in her 70's. In this factory they had made her look much younger. In one part of this building you could watch them manufacturing body parts to look like certain people. You could watch the body parts coming off an assembly line belt. I was looking for hands that looked like mine. The body parts were all different colors. After they put them altogether the person rolled through giant rollers and were painted a flesh color. In some cases they painted them other colors. In one part of the dream I was painted dark black, not like skin-color black, but a regular black. I was supposed to blend in with other people who worked there. I think I ended up being a kind of marbleized black so I stood out just a little but it didn't cause a problem. As I made my way around the building, I kept getting lost. The building walls were very unusual. In some cases they seemed like colored adobe. In others they seemed to be stainless steel. I now had the ability to move through these walls and strange openings the way others had previously. I didn't see Nick R anymore from here but I knew that he was working in another part of the building trying to foil these people. The factory had been taken over by women and the work they were doing now was only for good."
"0416"	"(2002-05-17)"	"Our cohort was arriving at Sequoia Seminar for the final intensive of our PhD program. I arrived at the dining hall and was saying hello to those already gathered there. I talked to Mary Kay C about the location of our cabins. She told me our cabin was the furthest from the dining hall. I was very concerned about this because I had so much trouble navigating the mountain on our previous trip when our cabins were the closest ones to the dining hall. We were mulling around between the deck and the surrounding grassy area. I saw Jo V and asked her if she had saved me room in her cabin, since we have always been roommates. She said of course she had. When I went to my cabin I realized it was the closest one to the dining hall. I didn't have a key or it was in the cabin so I went back up to borrow Jo V 's key. I went back down again to change before our first meeting. As I was going back and forth all of the other students were standing together for group pictures. Terry K was there, from GC. it did not strike me as odd that he was there. I tried to walk in an area that would not interfere with their pictures. I saw others who were milling around also. I wondered why our cohort was not being included in this group photo. I thought it might be due to the fact that this would be our last intensive. I still thought they should have included us. Now, upon waking, I wonder who the other people milling around were as I know they were not members of my cohort. I finally got into my cabin but it was a very little, about 3 square feet cube with no roof. I reached into an area and got my clothes and was trying to change my clothes without being seen. Melissa J and Bonnie K came up and looked at a note on the door. I started to say that Jo V , Carmen A, and I were in this cabin but they quickly walked away. Then Carmen A came up and said they were looking for me because everyone was waiting for me. I was a bit irritated but said I was trying to hurry and would be there as quickly as possible. As I was changing the group photo finished and I saw some people exercising. They were all doing the same exercises and widely spaced apart. Each person had a partner car. The person was dressed the same color as the car covers. Each car had a colored cover on it but was being driven. The people were moving in conjunction with the cars, as though the cars were directing each move. I thought it looked very interesting, but unusual. I finally arrived back at the meeting room in the conference hall. Everyone was discussing where we were going to meet. Most of them thought we could use that room, but others thought it had already been spoken for. There was some discussion about having to use the meeting areas closest to our cabin block. Most didn't seem up to making the trek from that meeting space to the dining hall three times a day. I went to the kitchen and asked if we could have meals delivered. as we had during our first intensive there. They said they no longer do that. He was trying to give me some explanation that had to do with Mother's day. that was past already. I asked if he could prepare box meals and one of us could drive up the mountain at each meal and pick them up and take them to our meeting space. I think he was saying that he could do that when someone from another cohort interrupted and said they would want the same thing."
"0417"	"(2002-05-19)"	"I was the housekeeper for a man and his young son, similar to the movie Sleepless in Seattle. I had been working for them for nearly a year when they began the search for a new wife for the man. I was in love with him by this time. They found his new wife and I was experiencing the expected feelings about the entire situation, but I did not end my employment there. I did not feel the marriage would work out and I didn't want the man to feel worse when he found himself without a wife or a housekeeper. Shortly after they married, the wife became pregnant with their child. She gave birth to twins. Shortly thereafter she left him but took the twins with her. He was heartbroken and I for him. Within a month or so after she left she returned with the children, but only to leave the children with him to raise. She said she was not ready to raise the children. The man was a fisherman by profession. He had numerous fishing containers setup outside his house. They mostly had wood frames made of 4x4 beams. They were around 4 _ feet tall, 7 feet long and 2 or 3 feet wide. The top ledges were only a few inches wide. I took a bike outside and was riding very fast around the ledges of these various containers. They were all full of water. I don't know if they had different kinds of fish in them or what exactly was in them. The man's mother was concerned for me that I was riding a bike around these ledges, especially since I was riding so fast and turning practically on my side as I made some of the corners. I was somewhat frightened and yet surprised at how confident I felt in my ability to do this successfully. The man gave me a net the size you would use in an indoor aquarium and some ziplock bags. He sent me to one of the containers to begin catching fish. I found I was just as successful using my hand as using the net. All of the fish were about the size of aquarium fish but some larger than others. Some seemed impossible to see, either because they were so thin or because of their coloring. I'm not sure which. Others were larger and blue and white in color. I filled one bag. There was a lot of discussion going on between this man and his parents about this woman and the children. At this point the man was my ex-husband, Darren. When the woman returned with the babies we were in the midst of having a yard sale. Each of the containers now had flat tops covering them and we were sitting things for the yard sale on them. I found boxes of jewelry that I had put away because they were related, primarily, to my marriage to my ex-husband. There were a lot of earrings that were bride & groom and such. There were other earrings that I asked Bev if she would allow Mari Kate S to wear. Bev tried to describe what she would want to wear and what she would be allowed to wear. Jody S was also trying to help clarify for me. Mari Kate S finally came out and was looking through them. I picked up a few pairs and pointed them out to Bev and Jody S. They were some of my favorites from the past that I had been saving, hoping they would come back in style. Kay H brought a number of things out that I loved. Some of it was jewelry but others were knick-knacks I was quite surprised that she didn't tell me to just take the things I wanted. After the yard sale was over we were moving everything back into the garage. Kay H and Darren didn't think I knew how to properly care for the twins, so I let them take care of them and I concentrated on organizing the garage. Ray H had a few shelves in the garage with various glass and plastic items sitting on them. I wanted to put all like items together and move the glass items to the sturdiest shelves. In examining the shelves I realized that one was simply made up of a nylon fabric and resembled a kite. It also had hinges so it could be dropped similar to a drop leaf on a drop-leaf table. I realized it was useless for storage. I went to another shelf that was a huge half-circle that protruded far into the room. I was trying to move some of the furniture and things along the walls so I could move around more easily and get to these shelves more easily. In doing so I nearly knocked quite a few of the glass items to the floor. Actually I think I did knock some of them off but don't recall anything breaking. Near this one unusual shelf was also an unusual metal rack on the wall that was being used to hold glasses and such. This rack rested flat against the wall but hinges allowed different sections to be pulled just far enough away from the wall to allow you to slip an upside down stack of glasses on it. There were quite a few pieces, 100 or more, of one type of blue glassware. Some of them were on this wall rack and others were on the large semi-circular shelf. I was going to put them all on the shelf but then realized that shelf would not support all the weight. I was going to put them all on the rack but then Kay H came out and began telling me how to do that as well. Just for fun, someone suggested some kind of contest involving the number of garage sale items we were each working with. An adult was to represent a child. I was representing Rachel S. I would have won except that I did not get my items counted fast enough, primarily because I had so many more than the others. which is, oddly, what it took to win but you had to have them counted in time too. We are back to dealing with and arguing about the care of the twins. The size of the twins kept changing. they weren't even as big as my hand. At another time, one was nearly the normal size of a newborn and the other was less than the size of my hand. Then they were pieces of paper rather than actual babies, but each baby was two pieces of paper rather than just one. There was some discussion about where the twins would sleep and where Darren and I would sleep. Certainly, I had no desire to share a bed with him as the mother of the twins had done and yet somehow that seemed to be critical to the nocturnal care of the twins. The bed was not a normal bed however. It was more like a sofa with a cot in front of it. We each sat on one end of the sofa and stretched our legs out onto the cot. For some reason it was finally decided that I was to leave and take the twins with me. It is unclear to me if I was to take them permanently or if I was taking them on a purposeful journey. I was to take this journey on horseback, alone with the twins. There was a man helping me to prepare the horse, saddling him and putting the things I would need in the saddlebags, etc. I am traveling on a Native American pilgrimage with Matthew. I have the sense that the purpose of this pilgrimage was primarily for Matthew but somewhere along the way I realized that I was and would continue to derive as much if not more from this journey as he would. We had several things that Matthew had to accomplish on this journey. I believe it was to include two nights out in the woods. There were a number of people on the same journey, so we found we were not alone in figuring out what to do or knowing what we needed to do or how to accomplish those things. I was glad to know this. We became very fond of our fellow travelers. I became more in love with Native American Culture than I had even previously been. The people were wonderful and the traditions and rituals were so rich and wonderful. The rituals were wonderful not just because of the ritual itself but because of the transformation Matthew and I, and others, experienced as a result of completing each ritual. there was something that would be beneficial for Matthew to acquire. Oddly, the only way he could acquire it was to purchase it. It was quite expensive and I realized that neither he nor I could, or should, spend that much money on that item. An elderly Native American man sold it to us for what we told him Matthew had in his bank account which was around $16.99. I felt bad because we lied to him. Matthew had nearly $35 in his account, which was the actual price of the item. I didn't want Matthew to be totally broke so I lied to the man about how much money Matthew had. This struck me as particularly odd because I knew I wouldn't normally do this. When Matthew was writing the check to the man, I made sure he kept hidden the total from his check register. There were several scenes in which the entire group was riding horseback to our next destination or ritual. We were told that for one of the rituals Matthew would need to entirely undress. I knew Matthew would be uncomfortable with this but understood the purpose of the ritual and thought it would be very beneficial. I realized how beneficial it would be for me so I participated in the ritual as well. It was incredibly freeing, as though my soul had been freed. It was exhilarating. I became totally hooked on the entire process and future opportunities. When we settled into our campsite for the night we were preparing meals. I was having a little trouble contemplating eating the food that we were expected to eat. I couldn't bring myself to eat the first thing. The next thing they brought was the foot of some very large animal. It still had the fur on it and everything, but it had been cooked. I cut off two toes. I gave one to someone else and then I ate one. I was surprised that it didn't taste too bad. It seems that I was even eating the fur and didn't mind it. In our next ritual we were given some freedom in how we completed it. Given how great it felt to be able to complete the ritual of being completely nude in front of all these strangers I decided that I would remove most of my clothing and due a Native American dance around the campfire. Everyone admired the progress I made and my new level of confidence. I thought about the twins, thinking something like oh, yes. The twins. I pointed them out or said something about them to the others. Later I thought, wait a minute. I started out with the twins. I can't just not have them in the dream anymore. So I remember thinking something about having them in a type of papoose on my back. We are now sitting in another location talking about future similar, but advanced, journeys we can complete. We would do so in a certain order. To progress to each journey we would need to adequately complete the requirements of the prior and be living a certain lifestyle. At this point I am writing notes on a piece of paper about the things I need to do so I can achieve this level and move on to the next journey. Some of the things this included were writing on a more natural kind of paper and wearing different kinds of jewelry. like more things with feathers and such. There was some type of Native American title that went with the completion of this journey. I can't remember now what it was. It started with a T. Tahoe? Tecumseh? I don't know now. While we are at this place there are also containers sitting around for trash and other things. I was trying to get all the trash into the right container, as I knew that was a perfect example of this new lifestyle. At first another woman or two was somewhat deterring me from what I was attempting. They did not see it as that important. Then someone came around to collect the trash and had a momentary conversation with me about it and I realized that I was right. There were also binders and books sitting around. The speaker was talking about various things we could do to complete the various journeys. She mentioned something about Deepak Chopra. I recall seeing other names. There were other rituals but I don't recall what they were now. I went on a short horseback ride with someone else. There was something sexual about this experience. I was trying to help this other person heighten their sexual awareness or be able to get more pleasure from sexual experiences. On our way home I was riding with a man I had just then met. We clicked immediately and fully."
"0418"	"(2002-05-20)"	"I was at a meeting or conference. Someone was making a presentation about the Maori Drawing. I had an Aha of a way to make my use of this drawing better with dreamwork. I left quickly and went to get my files or something so I could make notes of my idea. As I was thinking about it I realized that wouldn't work anyway as it would be no different than doing a regular Maori drawing. I think I'll see if I can talk to Kendall B by phone and discuss an idea about this with him. Maybe I'll just wait until conference."
"0419"	"(2002-05-24)"	"I was living on the first floor of Shirley J's old house on Morse Lake. Bev's children came to spend the weekend. Matthew was not there. I was having trouble managing them myself. I was preparing to go on a trip and was going to be taking them with me. It was going to be air travel. I had a 6 am flight. I realized we would need to leave the house about 3:15 am. It was 1 am or so before I got them to bed. I was trying to decide where they were going to sleep. Since Matthew wasn't there I was going to have Andrew S sleep in Matthew's bed and have Rachel S sleep with me. There was another bedroom on this floor. I thought I would have Mari Kate S sleep there. However, I decided, since this was a very large, expensive home, I would take them upstairs and show them the rest of the house. I thought they would enjoy seeing it. As we started upstairs I thought, since Shirley J's bed never gets slept in anymore and it is such a large bed I could have all three of them sleep together in that bed. I'm not sure why I would do that though. We went upstairs. The house has these big wide staircases with red velvet carpeting. We went to Shirley J's bedroom. I opened the door a little bit and noticed a big pile of bed linens on the floor next to the bed. I started to open the door a little more slowly and I noticed someone in there. It turned out that Tom G was sleeping on the floor with a girlfriend.] I woke him up. He sat up and said, What the ___?] I quickly said, Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize anyone was in here. He got up and came out. I said, I come up here every now and then just to check things out and make sure everything is okay. I didn't know you were here. Actually I was trying to come up with a good excuse for being up there. I also couldn't figure out how he got up there without my knowledge. We turned around and walked away. I don't think he followed us. I realized that there was another couple up there, friends of his, in another of the rooms up there. We started to make our way down. The rest of the dream, down the stairs, was a long time. It became a maze of rooms and walkways. Some of the time it was ramps. Sometimes it was escalators. Sometimes the floor actually rolled downwards, so you stepped on it and then just let the floor roll you down to the next level. At each level there was another group of rooms. The rooms were very unique and some had themes. One of them was an Alaskan room. It was pure white, cold, snowy, and icy in the room. There were Eskimos in the room sitting my igloos and fires, wearing white parkas. I think they actually lived there. I had a lot of trouble keeping track of the children, particularly Andrew S and Rachel S, but even Mari Kate S from time to time. I was getting very frustrated with them. I would ask Mari Kate S to help me get Andrew S and Rachel S. Andrew S was playing with Rachel S on a stair rail and she fell off backwards and down several floors. I went crazy. I was screaming and crying. I was afraid to go down and see her, yet I knew I needed to get down there immediately. I knew it was going to be devastating for bed. I didn't see how Rachel S could possibly survive such a fall. I ran down the several flights of stairs only to find Bev standing there holding Rachel S. Bev had tears in her eyes and I could tell she was very upset. She had caught Rachel S, so Rachel S was fine. I didn't even try to explain to Bev what had happened. She didn't look particularly upset with me, but with what happened and what the potential outcome could have been. She didn't seem to want an explanation. I took Rachel S and Bev said something about, yes, you know how I am about my baby. I can't seem to separate myself from her. I'm always worrying about her. I was surprised that Bev was even in town, but she left right after that. Now we were back with Andrew S and Mari Kate S and we were back to working our way down these various levels of floors."

Dwight W was standing nearby, jealous because he thought that Albert S and I were attracted to each other. Dwight W was interested in me. I told him there would be no romance between he and I. I remember climbing up into the tree for some reason. I don't know if it was to get something or to get away from something. I think we were perhaps a little older than teenagers. I remember their being a school, steps, and a hanger."

"0422"	"(2002-05-26)"	"I decorated this room. I simply had to move my hands in different ways and the colors and the patterns on the walls would change. Sometimes I had trouble getting them to change so someone else would do it for me. One time I wanted to change it back because I didn't like the new look, but I was having trouble doing so. Someone else helped me. There was a bed in this room that seemed to be enclosed by fabric and several steps up from the floor. You had to go up a few steps and then part the curtains/fabric to climb into the bed. The colors were so bright, vivid, and beautiful. There were lots of gold and silver shiny things like stars and such."
"0423"	"(2002-05-26)"	"It was a Dollar Day. Many of the JLI members were working. They had a very large buffet lunch. Some of the members were serving dinner and washing dishes. There were three rods of bedspreads, one above the other, in the backroom. I looked at all of them trying to find something I liked. There were two rows of children lying on the floor at naptime, where the rods of linens previously were. The rods are steel pipes attached to the ceiling and floor and not the type that can be moved easily. The children were not given mats or anything to lie on. They had to lie on the cement. Some of them weren't actually lying. They were moving around a lot in their own little space. This seemed to be okay. I went and had lunch outside with Jane H and Janet S. After we finished eating they needed to get back to work. I put my dishes away and told them I needed to go as well. I spent some time on the sales floor looking at some furniture and talking to some shoppers."
"0424"	"(2002-05-27)"	"I had lunch in the mall with my CRHP sisters and Sue P. Sue P said Vince P hasn't been well and hasn't been around much, maybe not in town much. I wondered if this is why he has not returned my calls lately. Sue P had black and yellow hair braids attached to her hair. We all sat at round tables with 3-4 people per table. We were at Keystone at the Crossing Mall. When I left the mall I couldn't find my car. It was near Christmas time. There was snow on the ground and it was very cold. I went into another restaurant, which you could enter from the parking lot, to warm up. Bill C. was there alone, sitting in a booth. I joined him and he told me he was waiting on another couple that he was going to be dining with. We chatted until they arrived. They all invited me to stay and then Bill C could drive me around to find my car. When we got ready to go he needed to use the restroom. He went down this long hall and was waiting for someone to come out. He was wearing a long beige sweater, similar to one I own. His had large patches of brown leather on it. We were driving around looking for my car. We were talking about Christmas and that he still needed to do some Christmas shopping with just a few days left. I recall talking about his family and some other things. He told me that I needed to lose weight. I could tell there was some chemistry between us. I don't recall if we found my car or not. Before I got out of his car he leaned over and kissed me."
"0425"	"(2002-05-27)"	"Someone, a female, was organizing the books on my bookshelves. She was putting them in order by author, mixing in my dream books with all the others. I told her I wanted the dream books separate, on the shelves nearest the computer."
"0426"	"(2002-05-31)"	"I believe I was with Susan J throughout this entire dream. I think we were at her house. Susan J was having a LRJ party in her home. She had not done the elaborate display that I used to do for those parties. I was telling her that I should have done mine that way, as it would have been so much simpler and less expensive than creating all of the elaborate displays that I used to create. I don't remember whom she had invited. She showed me around her house. I said, I finally get to see your home. We talked some about our children. I can't recall the age of hers in relation to mine, either a few years older or a few years younger."
"0427"	"(2002-06-01)"	"I was staying either visiting or living at Morse Lake with friends. Someone was banging on the door. It sounded like they were using chains. We tried to ignore them because we didn't know who it could be and we were somewhat afraid to let them in. We finally could no longer ignore them so we went to the door. It turned out that their boat was sinking into the lake and their baby was still in it. I was aghast at how they could allow something like this to happen, that they were all safely out but their infant baby was still buckled in. I yelled at my friends to follow me and instructed them to lean over one side of the dock and push with their hands down on the end of the boat that was still above water. It raised the other end of the boat far enough that I could rescue the baby. I dried and nurtured the baby. I was hesitant to give him back to the parents. They didn't seem very concerned. The baby's name was Robert. I began calling him Robbie. The parents hesitantly took the baby back and they all left. A few hours later they returned and left the baby. I raised Robbie for a few years. His parents came back and took him back until he was an adult. A few years later, a group of people began blowing up houses that sat on Morse Lake. We were watching from inside the house, yet it was as though we had an aerial view of the lake and could see the top of each home as it was blown up. We kept being thankful that they didn't get to close to us. Finally, however, that did get to us and they blew up our house. None of us were hurt, but landed in the lake with a piece of our house, about the size of an average size boat. We all climbed on top of this piece. It was flat and somewhat oval in shape. It had carved poles coming up with another flat piece of wood on the other end of the poles. This gave us shelter over our head. There were four adults including myself and two adult male children. both mine. These two children were named Greg and Charlie and I simply adored them. They were my life. During the entire dream I was attending to my children, to keep them near me and make sure they were safe. As we were floating in the lake, we saw Robbie. alone. He floated over to us and got on our raft with us. I was so ecstatic to see him. He said he and his parents had split long ago. I asked why he hadn't come back home to me and he said he wasn't sure that he was welcome. I fussed over him quite a bit at that point, but trying to be careful not to make the others jealous or to question if I loved Robbie more. I simply felt so bad for Robbie and the life he had. I considered him my own son. Another of my son's found us and joined us as well. I don't know how many of these boys were my biological children or if they were my children the same way Robbie was. I can't remember the name of the fourth one. He is the one that felt most unloved and left out. I tried often to reassure him because all four of my boys were all equally important to me. We decided we needed to take pieces of the wood and paddle down the lake to another town for refuge. As we paddled the lake became more and more crowded with other families in the same situation. Some were actually in boats, but most were on pieces of wood from their homes. As we continued down the lake it became a river and became very narrow. At points the river was bordered in wood. We had to navigate through these sharp turns that were much smaller than our raft. Somehow our raft seemed to lift right above the wood barriers and carry itself over to clear water. We ran into several similar situations. As we navigated along, we saw many people stranded on the shore and frightened. We decided there was room for more people on our raft so we pulled along the shore and allowed more people to join us. At one we came to a fork in the river. If we continued straight ahead, we could see another town that was being destroyed. At the end of the left fork we saw a carnival. We somehow maneuvered our raft over the grass island and headed down the left fork of the river towards the carnival. As we neared the carnival we saw that it was also being destroyed. We found another fork and veered off in that direction. We finally found peaceful waters with homes on either side of us and no sign of danger. However, there were many things floating around us. These things, as best I can describe them, looked like floating counters with stools, such as you would see in a diner. There was a woman behind the counter of one. It looked as though there were enough seats for everyone on our raft so we asked her if we could come aboard. We were all hungry and thirsty, as we had been afloat now for many hours. This had begun at dusk and it was now way beyond dawn of the next day. She didn't seem to want us there, as she didn't want us to take up all of her seats. There were many others with more seats and no people so we went to another."
"0428"	"(2002-06-02)"	"I was living at my birth home. My father was the man who is the father in the TV show State of Grace. He was a very kind, loving, compassionate father. He had some health problem and was required to rest and not be too active. It seems as though he was in the hospital. I brought in a deck of cards and I moved his tray close to him so he wouldn't have to stretch or move too much to play. There were four of us playing. I commented once that I didn't like the playing cards we were using because the symbols were too confusing. At least for me, I added. The others didn't seem to have a problem. We were each supposed to have three cards in our hand at all times. When it was our turn, we would lay one card down and then draw another from the stack. I have no idea what the game was. I realized I had a lot more than three cards in my hand. At this point it seemed that we were at home and Daddy was standing behind me. He told me to turn my cards face down and he would take the extras away. He took quite a few. I showed him there were still way too many, so he took more. I was wearing my purple sleep shirt and I walked outside on the back sidewalk. Daddy came up behind me and hugged me. I was crying. He wanted to know what was wrong. I told him how frustrated I am because I try so hard to lose weight and to get my sleep schedule under control and I continue to be unsuccessful. I told him I need help but I don't know who can help me or how."
"0429"	"(2002-06-16)"	"I was a member of the family on the TV show Seventh Heaven. It seemed to take place, in a way, over a period of several years. I was one of the children. I was the one that seemed to be particularly close to the father. It seemed that the mother of this family was in some way abusive of the children. Not physically abusive and not sexually abusive. She neglected them and was abusive in how she punished them. We were in the attic of the home and it was very similar to the attic of my birth home. There was a regular staircase that led to the attic. The whole thing was hardwood floor, not finished. You could walk through the middle but towards the walls you couldn't stand upright as the roof angled down. The attic was used for storage. Myself and two of the younger siblings were up there. I get the feeling that we were up there because we were being punished. We started organizing the stuff up there but I'm not sure why. In one section of the attic there were a bunch of boxes of blankets. There was a pole. The pole held hangers with blankets folded over them. Mother came up into the attic. I don't know if she was particularly angry. We were explaining to her what we were doing. On one end of the attic there were a bunch of very long narrow boxes leaning up against the wall. They were really dirty and had cobwebs on them. I kind of pulled one of them over a little to see what was in them. It was curtain rods. I was going to move them to the other end of the attic. As we had been organizing things we were moving them down to the other end of the attic. Then I started second-guessing the way I was moving everything down to the other end. I wondered if maybe that wasn't the best way to organize things up there. Maybe I should categorize things but not bunch it all together so much. Maybe leave it spread out more. I was going to do something with all of those blankets. The father came up now also. This is the first time that he got a sense that the mother was mistreating the children. I think eventually both parents went back downstairs and left us up there. The parents were hosting a party. The mother was starting to act towards the guest the way she normally does towards her children. She was also treating her children, in front of her guests, the way she normally treats them when there is no one else around. People were becoming very concerned about her treatment of the children. Her behavior became worse and worse. She was eventually committed to a mental rehab facility. The father was extremely distraught over this. Not over the fact, so much, that she had been committed and he was now a single parent, but rather that he had just learned what she had been doing to his children and he was distraught over the treatment of the children as well. It was especially difficult for everyone when she was getting ready to leave. She was walking slowly around the house looking at anything. She was feeling very sad but not necessarily remorseful. I don't think her feelings were associated with the fact that she was being told to leave but just the fact that she was leaving. There were no feelings of remorse. The father was staying away from her purposefully. I can't recall if he even spoke to her or embrace her before she left. It doesn't seem as though he did. Sometime later, she came back for a day visit. He didn't want to see her at all. He was still very distraught over the abuse. I get the sense that he was not going to be able to forgive her for this. Of course, in the TV show he is a minister and is very forgiving. The mother in the waking life show is not at all as she is depicted. Nonetheless, he is still really struggling with this because it is his own children. This next part seems to be a few years later. The children are coming home for a Christmas celebration. A couple of the older children are married and have children of their own now. The youngest child, Ruthie, is a little bit older now. Somewhere Ruthie and Simon were creating a big sign but I can't remember now what it was about. When everyone was there for this celebration. I had said earlier that I felt as though I was the child that was closest to the father. Several times during the dream, when I approached the father to offer comfort, I was the one that was always asking him if he was okay and hugging him often, sitting with him, when I could tell that he was especially distraught. The mother returned and she wanted to return to live there. She was knocking at a double door, trying to get in. I had my body against the area where the two doors meet to try to prevent her from getting in while the others asked the father what to do. He finally said we should let her in. When we opened the door we realized she was moving back in because the double doors led into the garage and we saw the garage piled full of all of her things. She was very frazzled and dirty looking, as were all of her boxes of possessions. As we were moving her in, there were rolls of carpeting. They were small enough that we could just pick them up and throw them over our shoulder to carry them. We realized while we were doing this and talking to her that she had remarried after she left, even though she had never gotten a divorce from my father. She was pregnant with her new husband's child. She was leaving him."
"0430"	"(2002-06-17)"	"Al H and his wife were living in the city where I live. I was at their house. I'm not sure why originally. His wife was not Diane H. They had two little girls with red hair. There were a lot of bizarre things because it was springtime, and yet the little girls were getting ready to go to school but were dressed in winter coats and hats and scarves. I was playing with them as they were waiting for the bus. All I could see was their eyes. The scarves practically covering all of their faces. I was playing with them and they were giggling and carrying on. Al H was just watching me interact with these two children. When they went to get on the bus, for some reason, they took their hats and scarves off and I saw their red hair. At some point they were paying me to do some things around their house. One of those things was planting flowers in their flowerbeds around the house. Another was to take care of getting this huge stereo system installed. I can't now remember what the third thing was. The dream progressed as I was getting these things taken care of. We were having a lot of trouble with the stereo system and getting it installed properly. First there were problems with the installation itself. I mean, just getting the units attached to the house. They were being attached outside. They did finally get everything attached but then it wasn't working. One of the neighbors from across the street. She was an older woman and had come across the street to talk to Al H's wife about it. At first Al H's wife was concerned that she was coming over to complain. So, right away she became defensive and ran out to the ward to talk to the neighbor. It turned out that the neighbor wasn't upset at all. Diane H kept saying things like, if it's ever a problem be sure you tell us. The woman kept saying, No, I'm not concerned about it. We finally got the installers out there again. There were about 15-20 men working on this thing. They had a platform built to get up to the roof level. They had on uniforms. They remind me of astronaut uniforms. They were big and puffy and had big boots. They were all over the place trying to get this stereo to work. They had lined them up along the back yard while they were working and trying to get them working. They were then supposed to put them back to wherever they were supposed to stay. Al H and Diane H were getting frustrated that it was such a hassle to get it to work. They started becoming concerned about the neighbors. They were finally ready to just leave the speakers where they were and actually they were beginning to not even care if they even got them working or not. All the men in the uniforms came trampling down from the roof and were gathering at the side of the house and by their truck. One of them was telling me something about these pieces of wood attached to the side of the house, while he was lightly hitting them, tapping them. He said, If they ever go out, if you see any other house with these on it and they don't have service either, then you know it's just been a blowout. These wood panels looked like plywood panels and they looked really ugly. No one seemed to be particularly concerned about that so I didn't worry about it either. During this process the landscaper was there and Al H was asking why the different types of flowers were all planted together. He said, well, that was your fault. They weren't planned that way. You were given the layout. We just deliver the flowers and you were supposed to plant them. That was one of my jobs. I was looking at the layout and I pointed out to the landscaper, see, you have this number here, this number here, etc. And that's exactly what you delivered to me. You delivered this many of this certain flower, and this many of that flower, etc. So that's how I thought they were supposed to be planted. She said, No you received twice that many and half were for in the back flowerbeds. I said, It doesn't say anywhere on here that they aren't planted together. I'll just dig them up and replant them. Al H agreed that I needed to do that. His house was practically right next door to WDF. I had walked over there just spending time waiting for one of the contractors or something for the house. I went into the office and it was a mess. It looked like they were moving people around. I said, Wow. I don't think I even remember my way around this place. It seems that Marcia N was there. I think I talked to her for a little while. There was someone else. They asked me if they could help me. I said, No, I used to work for Al H. They said, Oh. His office is right over there. I said, No, that's alright. I'm really just spending time waiting. I went back to the house. Marlene F was there talking about how she used to work for Al H also. She didn't in waking life. There seemed to be some kind of competition going on between her and I for Al H's affection. Al H came on to me once. I gave in and we ended up making love. Later in the day I was teasing him, being playful. He said, Geez. Back off. You really need help. I was really offended by that. I just decided that was the end of that. I wasn't going to do that again. Later he was very distraught and I was trying to comfort him about all these things going on and reassure him that everything was going to be taken care of to his satisfaction and that everything would work out okay. Al H and Marlene F and I were sitting on the sofa. Al H was in the middle but it was an odd shaped sofa, so we weren't sitting right next to each other. I was feeling envious of Marlene F so I moved over right next to Al H so he could lean back against me. I was stroking his hair and such. Marlene F reached over and was trying to stroke his arm and comfort him as well."
"0431"	"(2002-06-17)"	"Kay H was at my house. I believe it was my birth home. We were in the kitchen preparing a meal. I was expecting a blind date. I was fixing fish and pasta for my date, Matthew, and myself. We fixed Kay H some hot dogs. I got into the lunch meat drawer of the refrigerator. I asked Kay H why she has always hated me so much. She said she was concerned about Darren and Matthew. She went into the other room. I told Matthew, who is 5-6 years old, to take Kay H's hot dogs to her. We went ahead and ate because my date was late and I thought he might be standing me up. After we ate I went into my bedroom. I sat on the bed and tried to call him. I don't know if I couldn't remember the number, if I was misdialing, or if I was just having trouble getting connected. I got the wrong number several times. Suddenly, he came bounding into the room and plopped onto the bed, lying on his side, propping up his head with one hand, elbow resting on the bed. This seemed to be perfectly natural for him, even though we had never met before. We introduced ourselves. He apologized for being late. It was due to his work. He has a job working with young people. This causes him to have a hectic schedule. He says this has prevented him from having a lasting relationship. that most women can't deal with it. He says that if I want to be with him I will have to accept that. He and I were in a car. I had to return a wig to some thugs. He was concerned about me. He suggested we not get out of the car or stop the car. As we drove by the thug's car, we just threw the wig out our car window and into their car window. We went back to the house. My parents show up. I went to change clothes. When I came out there was a wall of bright pink chiffon curtains that were periodically gathered together in a rosebud fashion. They were at the top of very wide, white steps. When I got to the bottom of the steps there was a wall of bright yellow chiffon curtains, again followed by a set of wide, steps. This was repeated 2-3 more times. This man and myself were fighting off a group of thugs. We were doing pretty well holding our own at first. But then we both got picked up and thrown into a wooden wall/fence that resembled a wood plank fence. It was solid like a wall, however and none of it broke when our bodies slammed into it."
"0432"	"(2002-06-17)"	"I sit at the window and gaze out into the crystal clear air adorned with the lush landscape of a warm spring day. The emerald green carpet of grass highlights a sea of Mother Nature's finest floral jewels. What could possibly improve upon such a perfect day? Before I finish the thought in my head, I hear the whirring of the garage door, as it lifts to allow entry. I walk out to meet him. Such a paradox! It seems both like minutes and like years since I've seen him last. And still the butterflies flitter, a familiar sign of new romance, and I know I must stop them. This is an unattainable romance. Or is it? He enters the room and we sit side-by-side, sharing a glass of wine. He is charming, engaging, and intellectual. I found the conversation both stimulating and titillating. He is everything I remember him to be. How can that be? This is the first time I've actually met him and engaged with him. Yet it feels as though I've known him forever. As our conversation continues I notice the familiar, initial, light touches on the arm and hand. The touches of a budding romance? As we both express our enjoyment of the evening, we part company. My mind begins to work on this mental puzzle. Had we really not engaged before now? Is this how it feels to meet a soulmate? The conversation was so easy. I totally forgot myself as my desire to know everything about this intriguing man grew stronger. What a wonderful feeling, to be so focused on another. Thump! Confusion. Reality. , where have you been? What do you think you're doing? Where do you think you're going? Can you not see all of the roadblocks? Love conquers all you say? That kind of talk is for romantic fools. But, the chemistry! The spark! The fire! The beauty! The feeling of finally being at home! Is it simply a romantic fantasy? Maybe more people should look at the possibilities instead of the impossibilities. Perhaps that would give me the long yearned for love. Perhaps if more people thought that way it would give the world a long yearned for love. The world is full of both/and. Remove either/or, assumptions, and judgements from your vocabulary. They are the curse words of the new millennium."
"0433"	"(2002-06-18)"	"I was with Ben D. We had gone out of town together to visit his brother Stanley. Apparently we had been in a relationship now for a little time at least. It was evening. We were sharing a bed, but only to sleep. He expressed his concern over his brother hearing us making love. We spent some time kissing, cuddling and being playful. It was somehow going to have a negative effect on him if his brother found out. Perhaps it would effect his inheritance or something he owned. I can't recall for sure. When he leaned in to kiss me the first time. I saw his face so clearly it was as though I was awake. I questioned if I was lucid. I thought, Wow. I see his face as though I were awake. It was a very nice feeling. I had said something to him about how much his affection for me meant to me. He smiled and said, me neither. I smiled and thought to myself that it was kind of an endearing thing that it didn't bother me that instead of returning or affirming a positive statement like that, like saying I feel the same way, he always turns it into an opposite. Instead of saying me too he says me neither. In waking life I just rolled my eyes as I tried to explain that because it is difficult to explain. This is the best I can do. I remember being surprised at how incredibly gentle and loving he was. As we lay there holding each other and kissing. He expressed his frustration at not being able to make love to me. The nice thing though is that it wasn't about the sex at all, the desire to be together or to make love wasn't about the physical at all. It was about the emotional and soul connection and the desire rooted in that to be even closer in those ways. He picked up a bottle of perfume off of the bedside table. He sprayed it into the air and didn't like the smell of it at all. I said, What? You don't like it? He said, No. That smells bad. I said, Oh. Well. That's the perfume that I've been wearing for the last ten years. He just looked at me. I said, That's okay. I'm ready for a change. You can buy me something that you like. We were also talking about his hair growing out and him shaving his head. He had really black hair. And also through the dream he kept calling me darling."
"0434"	"(2002-06-22)"	"Some of the cast from friends. I was managing a store, maybe a drug store. One of the people I had working for me was royalty. Maybe the son of a king? One time I asked him if he could close up the store. There was also a part where some of the cast from the TV show friends, Chandler, Joey, and Ross, were each with a woman. One was Julia Roberts. One was Courtney Cox. I don't know who the other one was. There was some kind of a horse race involved. The king had switched pants with his son. The three Friends had gotten their pants switched somehow. When the king found out there was a third person involved he got really upset. He came storming into this room where these three couples were having this competition and saw them all so barely clad. He then threw another fit over that. I didn't seem to be involved at all. I was just watching it happen."
"0435"	"(2002-06-22)"	"I was bodily flying around the houses of my CRHP sisters who live in Foxtown. I was opening their shutters and curtains or draperies from the outside of the house. I was singing this song about letting the sunshine in. When I was outside of BJ's house, I knew she was in the shower but I still opened the curtains to her bedroom windows. I thought that might be a problem but I. it might have just been a split second that she was in the shower or bedroom. But I did it anyway. Like she will see it on time and it won't be a problem. There were a couple of them that I wasn't sure if I had the right house but I did it anyway. Later, BJ asked me about it. If I was the one that did it. Then I didn't want to admit that I did it. that I opened her bedroom curtains. I said, Yes. I opened some of them. That was a lie. Part of this started because I knew that Julie D was upset or depressed so I wanted to open her windows and let the sunshine in. I thought that would help her over her depression. Some time after that I went to Julie D's house and encouraged her to get out. I told her I would watch her kids for her for awhile so she could get out and do something on her own. She had two little girls and a little boy. I was somewhat concerned about the boy but I still wanted her to get out and do something on her own so I went ahead and watched all three of them. I took the kids to the beach but there was no more of that in the dream. I was bringing the kids home from the beach. Julie D and Mike D were there. The kids were talking about what a good time they had except for the extreme heat. We mentioned that perhaps the next time we needed to do something about the heat. I suggested that perhaps a beach umbrella was a good solution. They thought too that was a good solution, but they didn't know if their dad would buy one. I asked, Why? How much are they? They said, maybe as much as $100. These are small children so I don't know why or how they would even know that. I said, Well, if we could find one for about $60, if he wouldn't pay for it maybe I would. They were hesitant to even ask him. I thought it was odd because they have this really nice new home in Foxtown. They drive very nice vehicles. They have a boat. Yet, the kids are worried that he wouldn't pay $60 for a beach umbrella for his children? It just didn't make sense to me so I decided to mention it to him. While we were talking to them about what a good time we had I said, Maybe next time we should have a beach umbrella. I understand you can probably get one for under $100. I think maybe we found one. I think maybe he mentioned like a Service Catalog. He said there was one for $61. I still wasn't sure if he was going to pay for it. He said we could order it out of that catalog. But I still wasn't sure if he was going to pay for it or if he expected me to pay them for ordering it out of their catalog. I think this was another time that I had gone to their house. Julie D and the kids had just snuck something in the house and they didn't want me to see it. Later I found out that they had bought something for me. It was two things that kind of looked like the cement birdbaths that people buy for their yards. They were that shape but they weren't nearly that heavy. One of them had elephants and things in the part that would be a birdbath but was unfinished. The other one had a brown and green glaze finish. It had something else in it but I don't remember what. Julie D told me to take it home with me but to act as though I had not seen the one with the elephants because the kids didn't want me to see that one yet."
"0436"	"(2002-06-23)"	"I was floating along the top of this lake. I was in a vertical position. I don't have the sense that anything was propelling me but I was moving pretty rapidly along the top of this river. I was floating along the top of the water but near the water's edge. Occasionally there were different alligators and things in the water. That may have been the reason that I was going fast or. It seems more that I occasionally I had to go up higher so as to be out of their reach. I was in these woods. Someone helped me to build a cabin. It was our intent to build a very inexpensive cabin. This was partially because I wanted to live in the woods. We didn't build it well, at all. The windows didn't fit properly. We had a huge rainstorm and we couldn't keep the rain from coming in around the windows. I was watching a basketball game on TV. It was a championship game between an Illinois school and a University in my home state. The Illinois team won. After the game they were interviewing the coach. The coach was Ben D. I was very excited about this. I decided to go outside and wait for him to come out so I could talk to him. When he finally came out there were mobs of people all over. I ran up behind him and put my arms around him and kissed him on the check. He turned around and kissed me lightly on the lips. He was surprised to see me there. I told him I was also surprised to see him. I told him I have a cabin here because I wanted a small place out in the country. I wanted him to stay and chat but he said he couldn't because he still had to get back to Illinois and he still had press people to talk to and had a game the next day. I said something about the next time he would be in my home state. One of the athletes had been injured in a car accident or something some time ago and had lost both of his legs. His father wouldn't take pity on him and made him keep working on what he really wanted to do. So the athlete kept working at playing basketball, even though he didn't have any legs. He didn't do it from a wheelchair either. He was simply using his hands to move himself around. He was playing in this game. He was a hero to people because he overcame this shortcoming."
"0437"	"(2002-06-24)"	"I was with my phd classmates. I don't know where we were but it was really cold. The places that were to sleep were like long rectangular, or long cubes may be the best way to describe it. Long hollow squares. Several of us would sleep in each one, two deep and two high and two across, eight of us. These were outside. Because it was so cold we had to dress really warm. It was kind of like a survivor show. We left one at a time. About half of us were left and I was still there. I was thinking that I had a good chance of being the last one to go because I get along well with everyone and I don't cause a lot of problems. There was something about laptop computers. Carmen A and Julien D were both still there."
"0438"	"(2002-06-25)"	"Matthew, Ashley B and I had gone to BJ's house for a family picnic. She had invited a lot of the Harris family. Richard K also showed up just as I was leaving. Someone else, and I said, oh, both Richards are here. While we were there she had three live turkeys running around in the house and other birds flying around in the house and sitting on the tables and eating the food. It didn't seem to bother anyone but me. When I got there Kim H had asked me to fix her watch for her. I sat down at BJ's sewing machine to fix it for her. BJ wanted to know what I was doing. I told her. She said, Oh well, isn't that just perfect! Kim H can't ask me to fix it for her. She has to ask you to fix it for her. Sarcastically. I said, I don't know what the deal is. You and Kim H really need to work things out. She asked me to fix her watch and I just said I would do it for her. BJ said, are there holes in the stitching in the seams. I said that I didn't see any. She said, Well let me see it. So I held it up and showed it to her and she couldn't find any either. That seemed to upset her even more. Then she started in on me my about her kids liking me best. She was going on about all the things that she was mad about. She was being very mean. I finally said, Look, I'm just going to go home. I don't deserve this. I'm just trying to be nice to your kids. I don't know what your problem is with them or with me. But I don't deserve this and I'm just going to go home. The more this went on the angrier I became. I became beside myself with anger. Even when I awoke I still felt the anger. BJ just had a huge chip on her shoulder about something. Especially regarding Kim H and I just wish they could work it out. I went and wanted to find Bev and at least say hello to her before I left. I saw Bill F and was looking for Matthew so I could go home. Bill F told me where he was so I asked him to take me over there. We headed to the car to go get Matthew. As soon as we got there Matthew showed up and I told him we were leaving. He didn't want to leave right away. I told him what happened and then he was okay to go. I went upstairs where everyone was eating and I very quietly said hello to Bev and told her very, very briefly what happened and that I was very angry and uncomfortable so I was just going back home. Some people were just looking at me and wondering what was going on and I just wasn't going to get into it. I went downstairs and I was going to use the bathroom before I left and Mother knocked on the door and asked me if I wouldn't consider staying. She wanted to know what was really going on. I said, Mother I can't hear you right now. I finally said, I don't know what's going on with her but I don't deserve for her to talk to me the way she did when I was just trying to help her child. The bathroom morphed into this very large room, not like a bathroom, but I was still using the bathroom. All these people kept coming in and I kept saying, Can't I have a little privacy here? Can you not wait until I finish using the bathroom? Bill F and Matthew came in to give me something and kept their eyes averted. Brian F was sitting on a sofa next to me and somebody was sitting on the floor in front of me. I said, Look, I don't even have any clothes on. Can someone at least hand me some clothes so I can put some clothes on? Someone handed me a new white T-shirt with some words or something on it. I thought to myself that it wouldn't be very good because they would be able to see right through it. I went ahead and put it on. We had to go upstairs and find Ashley B. I asked Bev if she had met Ashley B and she said, no, who is Ashley B? I introduced them. Ashley B was sitting at a table and BJ was close by and Ashley B said, Can't I stay? I wasn't the bad girl. I looked at her kind of angrily and thought, Oh. Are you implying that I was the bad girl? That kind of upset me. Since it was Ashley B I was trying to be nice about it. We finally got out to the car. I was getting my things out of the front seat so Ashley B could sit in the front seat with Matthew. Suddenly we were driving and Ashley B was in the backseat and I was in the front. I said, No Matthew, pull over. I want Ashley B to be able sit in the front seat with you. She said something kind of sarcastic. I thought that was not necessary. uncalled for. We got out and switched. I got into the backseat. There were some suitcases sitting on the seat and other things. I don't know why all that was there. We took off again. Now Richard K was in the front seat also and there were BJ, Ashley B, and one small child were all in the front seat. We were going to take BJ back to her house. I was looking out the window. There was a child, approximately 5-6 years of age, heading into the house. He looked so familiar. I thought, I'll bet he's from the city where I live. I think I must know him from the apartment community. Now he is in the car with us, getting something from BJ. BJ knows him."
"0439"	"(2002-06-26)"	"All of my family was at Kidwell's. Uncle J's house. We were walking around and we walked down to the trampoline. We talked about how much we used to enjoy playing on the trampoline. There were three of them. they put Rachel S on one with me. I was having a hard time keeping her away from the sides. I don't know if I was taking too long on one of them or what, but everyone else either left or started using the other two."
"0440"	"(2002-06-27)"	"I was a contestant on a dating show. I was competing with 10-12 other women, ages 16 and 46. I was the 46-year-old. Ben D was there. There were three shower rooms. Two of them each had two showers and the other had just one shower. There were rooms that had just beds. The room was the length of the bed and not much wider. The shower rooms were the same size. Two of the bedrooms each had two beds and one had just one. One room for an employee was a bigger room but not much in it. It did have a shower in there and the door locked. At the top of the door was an open space, kind of like they used to have in old houses/buildings. We each created some kind of artwork on a piece of paper the size of a flipchart. I was being taunted. I violently lost my temper and destroyed someone's artwork. Four finalists were chosen to be contestants for the next year. It was one overnight. Most of the overnight bags, including my own, were the size of a regular handbag. I had to sleep in one of the large living areas as the beds were all taken already. The next day I wanted to take a shower either in the room with only one shower or take my shower in one of the other rooms when no one else was in there. I couldn't manage either one. I then went into the employee room and decided to use that shower. Other people were trying to get in. They didn't think I should be using that room. There was an entry hallway. In the hallway was a bar, like in a clothes closet. All the contestants had their formal gowns hanging there. I was one of the finalists for the next year. I was talking to the other finalists about our gowns for next year. Ben D kind of came to my rescue when the other contestants and some other men were being critical of me, etc. He expressed a romantic interest and told me he was going to take me away so I wouldn't have to worry about any of it."
"0441"	"(2002-06-28)"	"I was at my townhouse. I had to take everything from my patio indoors as the maintenance people were getting ready to poor new cement. My neighbors to my right had already cleared their patio, as they were the next ones to be completed. I looked through their gate and wondered where they had put everything, as they had a very large outdoor grill and large outdoor patio furniture, not to mention the many other things they had out their. I noticed the wood frame for the new cement had already been laid and their flowerbeds were full of overgrown weeds, as they do not plant flowers or care for them in any way. I began to carry the things from my patio into my dining room. The dining room of my townhouse was wider than in waking life. The neighbors to my left came out and began helping me to clear my patio. We discussed that the three families help each other clear and return things from each patio, as it is our turn to do so. I said that was a great idea. I realized that the neighbors on either side of me had become good friends when I knew the one family by little more than name and the other family not even by name. They were both black families. In waking life only one is black. As I was carrying things into my dining room I was surprised at how many things I had out there. I suppose I had taken things out there little by little over the last five years and didn't realize how much had accrued. I even had two floor lamps. I found that the cord on one had split completely apart and the two halves were no longer connected to each other at all. I was disappointed and frustrated but realized that I could get what I need at the hardware store and fix it as I had done with two of my indoor floor lamps. I had hung pictures and things on the wood fence. This next thing is difficult to describe. There were two things, the size of one of my flowerbeds, which had words on them. They were kind of like paper posters, but they had been lying on that flowerbed with other things sitting on them. One of them was a copy of a custom-made area rug. It had religious quotes on it and religious pictures. I had forgotten how beautiful it was I thought those quotes were very appropriate for me right now and that I should put them on something else so I can see them everyday. As we were doing this the neighbors to my right, still don't know their name, had built a very large wooden enclosure for their large black dog. I commented to them that their dog never seemed to care much for my rabbit, Sir Gallahad. I said he used to bark at him a lot. For that matter, he tends to bark when I'm out there also, but that does seem to have lessened. I'm not sure why they had built this enclosure. Maybe to be able to let him be outdoors when they are not home. Our shared fence had a gate in it, which allowed us to access each other's patios. As I was clearing my patio they moved the dog enclosure to my patio. I wasn't sure why. I had the impression that they did it because I had more room now and they wanted more room on their own patio. This enclosure was about 4 feet tall and approximate 7 x 7 feet square. Their dog stands about 3+ feet tall. At first the enclosure had a top on it but later it did not. While they were helping me to clear my patio they took some of the larger things and stored them in another wooden enclosure on their patio for me. We both acknowledged that it would only be for a few days anyway. I was a bit concerned about how they were putting some things in there. I was concerned that something might break. However, I was grateful for the assistance so I didn't say anything. when no one was around and the patio was almost empty I went to one corner of the patio, in a flowerbed, and urinated. I thought, This is cool that I can do this without any concern of being seen. It seems that I may have done this twice. I asked the neighbors how long they planned to leave the dog enclosure on my patio so they moved it back to their patio. Now it was smaller in width and length. As we looked down into the enclosure, the dog was in there. They also had several pink rose bushes. Someone else came up and cut the largest flowers off the rose bushes. They said that now the enclosure was fine to leave the dog in there while they were away. It was dark now, and I was standing out on the patio. I still had three lights out there. I think two of them might be fixtures that needed to be taken indoors and were not in their usual spot. I was thinking about how much I liked the effects of those lights and wondering why I don't take more time to enjoy that space that I have worked so hard on for the last five years. The mosquitoes?"
"0442"	"(2002-06-28)"	"I was in St. Joe and taking one or more classes at ECHS. I knew quite a few other people who were doing the same. We would walk to class together. I know Paulette W was one of the people I walked with. On more than one occasion I found money as I was walking to class. At least twice I found one and two hundred-dollar bills. The first time I just kept them, even though I realized I should report them as found and let the owner claim them. I rationalized that I do not report loose change when I find it. The evening after I found the hundred dollar bills the second time I had a date with Dan H. I told him about finding the money. He said, well, of course, you are going to report it as found aren't you? I said that of course I was. Even though I was thinking that I really need the money and don't want to report it. I was late for at least some of my classes and thought it didn't really matter since it wasn't high school classes that I was attending. I recall seeing Sister Dora come out of a classroom close the door behind her, leaning her back against the door as she pushed it closed. One day I was dressed for class in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt type of top. I had on high socks with some kind of boot footwear. I thought it was a popular look but I wasn't quite comfortable with it. I liked it and I didn't. I thought it was stylish but wasn't 100% sure. I decided to change before leaving the house."
"0443"	"(2002-06-29)"	"I thought I was awake listening to a Christmas Video/recording on the TV. When I thought I was opening my eyes I would see an animated video corresponding to the holiday song that was playing. I realized that they weren't playing all of any of the songs- that it must have been a commercial of some sort. I thought it was odd that they were playing this on TV in the middle of the year. Then I realized that I had put it in before I went to sleep. I was too groggy to get up and turn it off. I thought that maybe that is why Christmas had shown up."
"0444"	"(2002-06-29)"	"Several times I thought I was trying to wake up and trying to get Matthew to help me wake up. I felt I was napping too long but I was in too deep asleep to wake myself up. I tried to call to Matthew, Help me. Help me. Help me wake up. But I couldn't get anything out. I tried to roll over and was paralyzed and this frightened me. I thought to myself, This shouldn't frighten you because you know what it is and you tell other people about it. Still, it was frightening. I wanted to roll over to my side. I finally was able to do so. Then I thought I had somehow made it to my bedroom door, though I was lying on the floor. I was still trying to call for Matthew to help me wake up. I was trying to hit the door and/or the doorframe to get his attention. I thought I was moving my arms but I don't know if I was actually hitting the door or not. Whatever was happening wasn't working. I was not getting Matthew's attention and he was not helping me. I thought I had been asleep way too long and wanted to wake up. I didn't want to waste so much of my day off and I had a lot I wanted to do today. Still, I was in a very deep sleep and couldn't seem to wake myself up. I'm not sure if I looked at the clock 2-3 times in my dream or actually woke up enough to look at the clock in waking life. I had the sense that I had been asleep for about four hours. When I lay down to take a nap I was only going to nap for about a half-hour."
"0445"	"(2002-06-29)"	"I seemed to be in a learning environment, albeit a very unusual one. In this setting, each person was in an individual carrier of sorts. Perhaps something like a boat. However, we were evenly spaced apart and moving at the same rate of speed in two separate directions. The closest thing I can relate it to is an amusement park water ride. I don't even recall the purpose or what we were doing there. Whatever it was, I recognized that I was afraid to make the high jump down into the water, now without my carrier. There was a man below me in the water and he was throwing things up into the air and I was catching them and putting them into a compartment above and behind me. I was particularly interested in this man until I caught one thing in particular. When I caught this rocket-looking, blue and white item I thought it was a sign that we were meant to be together. However, when he realized that I had caught it, he instructed me to give it to his mother, that it was intended for her. Later something similar happened, I believe I was below and he was above and caught a bead necklace that I had thrown, and he then realized that we were meant to be together. Our places reversed again and I was catching nearly every necklace he threw upwards. Later we were on a beach. We were in training for something. We had to pass our training to be able to do whatever it is we were applying for. Something happened that we realized that we needed to hide from a group of people. There were very large orange flowers all over the beach. At will, accepted members of our group had the ability to turn them into beach umbrellas for camouflage. They did so until the danger had passed and then they turned the umbrellas back into flowers. I thought this was very cool because I realized that I would soon be able to do that- when I completed my training. Because of my connection to this man I had no doubt that I would be accepted. We ended up getting married."
"0446"	"(2002-06-29)"	"Staying in a hotel by the ocean in a bad part of town. I was there with Matthew. We were talking about me looking for a job and what we could do and things such as this. I thought it was a dream and then said, Oh, it's not a dream. This is great. It was not a very safe part of town. I wanted Matthew to be very careful. It was the type of hotel that people normally live in for short periods of time. They had kitchens, sitting rooms, etc. I decided to go out but I don't recall why. Once I got outside I wasn't sure which direction to head so I just started walking. A Young mother with a baby in stroller and another child passed me. I decided to stop her and ask her for directions. She directed me to walk up this steep hill and reminded me that this was not the safest part of town and that I should be careful. As I was walking up this steep hill I came to a church. It was very interesting looking. Nothing at all like any church I've ever seen nor would I have imagined it to be a church. I went up the three flights of stairs to the entry. The entry was a small square opening. In waking life no one, not even a child, could fit through it. Yet, somehow I entered through that small square opening. There was a reception or something going on in the church. I met Robin Williams and his wife. They were an elderly couple. We hit it off and they invited me to come home with them. I did so and called Matthew. He joined us there. Robin was very distraught. I think they were both tired of living. They want to die. They tried to kill themselves along with two children in a small square pool inside their hotel room. I found them in time to save them. They were not pleased, as they really wanted to die. There was something else about going through personnel files in an office."
"0447"	"(2002-06-29)"	"I went outside, in the evening after dark, to do some yardwork. I was going to trim the yard and bushes primarily. I was thinking about how much I use to enjoy doing that type of work, and how therapeutic it can be. I went to my two shrubs and had decided to trim them myself since the apartment maintenance men had not gotten around to it in some time and they were badly in need of trimming. I realized this may cause me to have more shoulder problems, as when I pruned my lilac bush. There was something else about a lot of people doing this at their own homes but I don't remember that part. As I started trimming the bush to the left I realized it was almost completely dead and that I would call the office to see if it could be replaced. The dead branches were the rusty brown color that dead evergreens turn to when they die. I decided to go ahead and cut it all out now anyway, until they could get there with a new one. When I got to the second bush there were parts of it that were dead. I debated whether or not to cut the dead out. I wasn't sure if it would look worse to leave it in or take it out. I decided to go ahead and cut it out. After I did that I saw lots of tall weeds growing through that brush. I got down onto the ground, starting on my hands and knees and then eventually moving to a sitting position, and started pulling the weeds. Some of them were very large and thick but I was determined to pull them rather than cut them off so I could get the roots out. It seemed that the more I pulled out the more I saw. Some of them were a very bright lemon-lime color. As I was finishing up I was walking closer to the wall of the townhouse when I realized that all of my Canna flowers were gone also. I was stepping in very soft gooey mud. I was wearing my moccasins and I didn't want to get them all muddy, but I also didn't want to go into the house to change when I had so little left to do. I stepped back into the grass and scraped my feet in the grass trying to get rid of the mud before it dried on my moccasins. When I finished there was very little bush left. In the midst of this trimming, I saw four people heading to their respective cars on the other side of the street. One of them said something, which made me look. I think the child might have said hello to me and his father yelled at him not to do that. I went to the truck - not at all like any truck I've ever seen. almost looked like some type of armored vehicle - to say something to the father but he just pulled away. nearly hitting me. The other two people had gotten into a car in front of him and had already pulled away. I went and got a broom to start sweeping up the cuttings from the driveway. As I was doing so I saw a dead grey goat, a little older than a newborn goat perhaps, lying in the gutter at the end of the driveway. This was very upsetting. I didn't know what to do. I thought I would finish sweeping and then decide. I continued sweeping the clippings up the driveway towards the pile of clippings in the yard. As I did so, I found a dead deer in the driveway. This was even more upsetting. I made the same decision to finish first. As I did so I also found a dead cow that was white and caramel colored, and a black bear. I tried to sweep the clippings around them to the yard. As I was doing so the deer shook its head and stood up. Next the cow and then the bear did the same thing. The goat was, in fact, dead. I was stunned. But then they started talking. They were going to do something about the man in the truck and their purpose in life was to do something about other people like him. To fight unkindness and cruelty in the world. I wanted to join them and help them in their cause. At this point I was barefoot and I wanted them to wait until I got some shoes on but they didn't want to. It was cold outside and I didn't want to walk barefoot on the cement. Plus, I knew that you shouldn't do that because you might injure your feet. I decided to take my chances on catching up with them and ran into the house to put some shoes on. It seems as though I am a man now. The inside did not look like the inside of my waking life home. I hurried upstairs to get some shoes. My wife was there visiting with two other men. One was her father the other may have been a brother. My child was in bed asleep. The house was decorated for Christmas I was rushing around trying to find some shoes. I saw a slip-on sitting in the hallway. I tried to find its mate. I debated whether it was mine or not and whether it was a male or female shoe. I put it next to mine and decided that it would fit. I finally found the mate and slid it on. I ran outside. As I did this I realized that my wife would so love to do this and seldom gets the opportunity. I went back into the house and let her go instead. They got into a vehicle together and left. I am a woman again now, myself in waking life. I was sitting with three other women on my bed. The house was decorated for Christmas. We had all just awakened from naps. I started telling them about the dream I just had about the bushes. We were extremely surprised and excited to find out that all four of us had dreams with very similar elements, centered around the bushes. Three more women entered the room. [I only know one of the women sitting on the bed and can't think of her name in waking life-just that she was a member of JLI and was single when I knew her. Two of the women who just entered the room I don't know.] Marlene F was the third woman who entered the room. I motioned for her to grab the rocking chair and pull it closer. It had a dark green seat cushion on it. One of the original four had lay back down and closed her eyes. I leaned over and asked if she was okay. She didn't respond. I told the new three about the other four of us having similar dream symbols during our nap. Two of the three that had just joined us said they had the same thing. The one lying down now sat back up and said she had just lain down for a few moments to try to capture more of the dream. She said she needed to make a phone call ASAP. I told her we would take a break in just a few minutes. We started talking about the dream having some message about Christmas. Myself and a member of JLWA were both single and had very similar feelings and experiences about Christmas over the last few years. We have both lost our joy in the seasonal celebrations and events. We quit watching the holiday shows, and quit going to parties and community events. We discussed that we should do those things together. That we should both try to be the force behind the other when we don't feel like doing something we know we used to enjoy so much. Even if it is just watching TV specials together. I felt as though I was begging her to do this. She agreed that we should but did not agree to do so. A reporter walked in the room and wanted to know if she could observe and take notes. I made sure it was okay with everyone else. I told her we were getting ready to take a five-minute break and then we would reconvene. She seemed irritated. I was trying to be pleasant and told her that one of the women needed to make a phone call at this time and another needed something else and we would keep the break as brief as possible. She still seemed irritated and that irritated me. I didn't have to let her observe after all. As it turned out when we did try to reconvene the reporter had left because we had taken too long. We decided to call it a night. I was still trying to partner with me in a holiday effort but did not get a commitment from her. I was thinking about all the things that I could do myself to try to work towards my personal holiday goals."
"0448"	"(2002-06-30)"	"Suggested to Matthew that we help each other wash our cars at home. I washed my interior, vinyl seats, the same way I would the outside. I had to rub hard to remove old, white streaks. Driving south on B1 Blvd. Very small black male child on bike road out in front of me and crossed Blvd. I was very concerned about him getting hit. I made a right turn in front of oncoming traffic. I would have had plenty of room/time except that I couldn't get my car to go for a few seconds after I made the turn. I was nearly hit and the cars that almost hit me were angry that I pulled out in front of them. My car power could be switched from peddle/bicycle power to engine. As I was headed south on B1 there was another black male child, adolescent, riding a bike. It had a platform on the cross bar and seat because he couldn't reach the peddles. His dad had fixed it so he could ride it this way. He sat on this platform and rested his feet on it. Crowd of people connected hands to feet, lowering each other down into this box. We were either trying to save someone or something or we were trying to get away from someone."
"0449"	"(2002-07-09)"	"I was working at the SXDS Regional office because there was a district manager's meeting. All the district manager's were in town and were staying at what seems to be a hotel. Gary S was there. Gary S was sitting to my left at a table for four. We were innocently bumping each other's feet and such. he reached under and touched my knee. A little bit later I reached under the table and rubbed his thigh. We knew were going to end up getting together that night, as soon as we would have a chance to be alone. Doctor C was there too, kind of in and out. I have no idea what he was doing there or what that was about. The place that the district manager's were staying, Gary S' anyway, was part of my house. When he came in, he was surprised at the changes that I had made in my living room. The house was unlike anywhere I have lived in waking live. It was kind of similar to my living room now, but it was larger. It was almost large enough for two living rooms, because I had several sofas in there and different things."
"0450"	"(2002-07-09)"	"This started out very pleasant but turned ugly. I went to visit Ben D at his home but it was in RI. Matthew went along. Matthew's behavior was very atypical and embarrassing. Ben D was put-off, for lack of a better word, at his behavior. Matthew kept trying to rush me to go home because he wanted to see Ashley B and go out with his friends. At times some of Ben D's students were present, as was his mother. Our behavior was in check whenever these people were present. Whenever we were alone he was very loving and attentive, expressing his desire to make love with me. Ben D had my weekly dream group publicized in a campus newsletter. One week I had a dozen or more of his students arrive unannounced for the group. Part way into the group I noticed that Dan M, Lou S, and Mark M had left. Samuel K was also present as a special guest speaker. I was telling the group about the recent SAID conference in Boston and Samuel K's costume as a Safari Hunter, with a stuffed, pink, elephant pinned to the back of his shirt. As I was conducting the group I realized it is July and my Christmas tree is still up. I looked at Matthew and said, I just realized it is July and our Christmas tree is still up. I was debating whether or not to even take it down at this point or to just leave it until Christmas this year. Many of the students said they hoped to be back the next week. I asked if anyone had see Lou S, Dan M, and Mark leave and someone said they had. She said they hadn't made eye contact however. After group ended I was in a car with three other people who had been in attendance. One of them was Carlton W. We were discussing why Lou S, Dan M, and Mark might have gotten up and left. I followed up with one of them and they said they left because they weren't sure they were comfortable with so many new people joining us."
"0451"	"(2002-07-09)"	"I'm at something like a stadium. Two women, celebrities, were in a battle for control of something, though not a physical battle. Everyone was in danger and trying to escape. Ben D seemed to be a primary target but refused to leave without me. we did get separated because she had spotted him and he needed to get away as quickly as possible. Others and I were yelling at him to run. Later I learned that he had been killed. I was very sad. I continued trying to escape from this stadium. Sometimes I found myself retracing my steps. I disconnected all the electrical sources for the kitchen area, as that is where she was holed up. I realized that two other women were trying to help her. They and two other men were sitting at this huge metal table that was on tracks. I electrically sabotaged the table and it crashed when they could not stop it. They ended up being killed with two innocent people as a result of my action. I felt bad but not guilty because I believed that I had saved many more people in the process. I wouldn't believe that Ben D had been killed. It seems that later I found out that he had in fact survived. I just needed to find him, to get to him. One of my efforts to escape was to hide in an upside down trashcan. The trashcan was clear plastic but the various trash bags in it were black. I had one of two men turn the trashcan upside down over my head and hide me on one side of it with the trash bags on the other side. This way I was hidden from view at some angles. They began to roll four trashcans to another area. I was in one of those and I was praying no one would see them from the angle where I was visible. I was lying somewhere asleep. I tried to wake up. I partially opened my eyes and thought I was truly awake. Things seemed still and quiet. I thought I was awake and that this whole thing had really happened. Then I realized that it wasn't over and the safest thing for me to do probably was to go back to sleep, or at least pretend to be asleep or dead. I was so drowsy that I couldn't keep my eyes open anyway. Someone came and got me and told me they had a safe way out for me. I went with them. They had me hidden and were rushing me by all of these other people. I asked if I could talk to them but they didn't respond. I was feeling a strong need to talk to someone as I had been going through this ordeal alone."
"0452"	"(2002-07-14)"	"I was in my townhouse, but it had an attic. I was cleaning out this attic. I wanted to get things ready to take to Mother and Daddy's to take to a garage sale. In this attic it had very, very high ceiling. It reminded me of the storeroom of a retail store, where it had shelves, maybe five high and on all four walls. Each of the shelves were pretty high and there was a lot of space in between the shelves so it had a lot of high things. Some of the things were very tall. I was deciding to get rid of so much stuff. There were 10-12 different sewing machines. I was commenting to someone on how I had all of my different sewing machines, from the first one that I learned to sew on through to the current one that I use now. I decided that I wasn't going to price anything for the garage sale. I wanted Mother and Daddy to just let people make an offer and they could decide if that was fair. I didn't want to take the time to put prices on everything because I had so much stuff. As we were getting this stuff down and carrying it out, I went out and saw that Daddy had set up to have the garage sale right there because there was so much. But at this point it seemed to be not at my townhouse. Maybe at my birth home but that doesn't seem right either. He had set up the garage sale in all these different rooms and different areas outside. He had gone ahead and priced things as we had carried them out to him. As we were taking things down off these shelves that I either didn't know were there or I had forgotten were there. So there were things that I was deciding to keep or that I had set out for the garage sale but then I changed my mind and decided that I didn't want to sell them after all. I brought those things back in. The things were primarily antiques or had an antique appearance. In fact, I commented to someone that these were the kinds of things I look for when I go to the antique mall. When we were close to having everything out there, I went out and started shopping at my own garage sale. When I added up the prices of everything that I wanted to keep it was around $1100. I asked someone if we really had to pay for our own things, for the things that we decided we didn't want to sell. So, I was carrying the things that I wanted to keep back inside. At that point, it seems that maybe there were things there that other people were selling as well. This makes sense in the context of my earlier question. I had found quite a few Native American things. jewelry, a headpiece with feathers. I said, That's what I needed for my SAID costume. I'm going to go ahead and buy it or keep it so I have it the next time I wear that costume. There were also two small stools. They were square, wood, painted blue, but also had something else painted on them like flowers or stencils. I decided to keep them so I could refinish them and keep them. There were also some very pretty porcelain things but I don't really know what they were or what they were for. There were quite a few porcelain things that I was going to sell and someone told me what they were but I don't remember now. I also realized as I was cleaning this out that some of the things had been left there by a previous owner. So I was debating if it was alright for me to keep the profit from those things. There was also a lot, a lot of stuff animals. I was just running my arm along the shelves and just knocking them all to the floor. Towards the end, one of the very top shelves still had some things on it, I was trying to get them down myself but I was afraid I was going to fall or break some of the things so I realized I had to wait until Matthew came back, then I could ask him to get those things. We left. I don't know who we is. For some reason, I don't know if we left and were going home. As I was looking around at the things that I had carried out there, the things that were for sale, I also found some Native American jewelry that I was going to buy. But after I gathered up all the things that I was going to keep or buy and saw the total, I started reevaluating and putting some things back since it was around $1100. Even though I didn't know how much of that I was actually going to have to pay since most of the things were mine. I carried the things of my own that I wanted to keep back inside. It seems there was also something to do with taking showers, or taking turns taking showers. Figuring out who was going to take a shower when."
"0453"	"(2002-07-14)"	"I went to visit Mother and Daddy. The house was different than their house in waking life. They had sold that house and moved into a retirement community where they had their own apartment or condo. It was very small. It seems that Mother was spending most of her time in bed. There was a little table by the bed and Daddy would sit in the room and read. You could see the front door from there. There was a little kitchenette off that room. It seems that was all there was to it. It was a very steep windy road leading up to their apartment. It was one lane. When I was getting ready to leave, I think Bev was in the car with me at that point, I had a string around the steering wheel. I was trying to steer using that string rather than putting my hands on the wheel. I was in someone's way and I had to maneuver the car around and in doing so I lost control a couple of times but we did not get into an accident and no one was injured. I didn't do any damage to anyone's property. Bev finally said, You don't have any control with that string. You have to hold the steering wheel. There was something to do with a cake. Maybe a wedding cake or an anniversary cake. It was chocolate. When I was in their apartment I was going to put that cake away. One of them said something about me taking some of it home so I put some of it in a separate container for me to take home. After I left, the car I was driving turned into something more like a skateboard except that it was larger. I could sit on it. It seems that Matthew was on it with me. A couple of times we missed our turn and we had to backtrack. Once we had to stop at someone's house and ask for directions. It almost feels as though we were in a race."
"0454"	"(2002-07-20)"	"I was with Ben D and my family."
"0455"	"(2002-07-21)"	"I was at a Harris family reunion with Bill C. He proposed to me. He was sitting at a table and I was standing next to him. There was a single red rose there and a piece of chocolate cake. He started talking about depending on me and something else. He dug his fingers down into the chocolate cake and pulled out an engagement ring. He was licking the chocolate cake off of it. I made a comment about our mutual love of chocolate. The ring was a very unusual shape. It was large and had a very high setting. A piece of the setting on the top also jutted out to the side. I don't know how to describe it nor do I have a very clear picture of it anymore. After that I was talking to various family members and they were saying how much they liked him. From a distance I was watching him interact with people."
"0456"	"(2002-07-23)"	"I went to visit Terry D. He and his wife lived in the country, but I don't know what town. I was talking to him but I was also outside with his wife, talking to her while she hung laundry on the clothesline. Primarily what I noticed her hanging was underwear. It didn't really bother me but I thought Terry might be embarrassed by that. Later we were in their town. He and some other woman were showing me around town. They had all of these underground passages, where you could walk around town and be safe from the elements. You wouldn't have to be cold or hot or get wet or anything. We were talking about the pros and cons of that versus walking around outdoors. Carriage rides wouldn't be as much fun there. But it was nice not to have to deal with very cold weather. It was as though all four sides of these passages were all brick. but a finished brick that was very smooth to the touch and very pretty colors. Yellow is the color I remember. They weren't just straight walkways. Some of them curved and some were hilly, for lack of a better word. I was with Bob F and we had these little cars on a sort of map. We were racing our cars and the map or path was very windy and such. These little cars had things sticking out from the bottom, similar to toy racecars my brothers had when they were younger. This map had a track. I was automatically going to win because I was in front of his four cars. It was just one lane. We also said something about his four sons."
"0457"	"(2002-07-31)"	"We had a regional SAID meeting in the basement of my birth home."
"0458"	"(2002-07-31)"	"I was struggling with whether or not I was awake. I thought I was sitting up on the side of the bed. I had my hands over my eyes or my ears. I decided that I was awake now, but I couldn't wake up fully. I heard noises downstairs and it scared me because I knew Matthew wasn't supposed to be home at that time. He was out of town. I managed to get myself to the bedroom door and get my door shut and locked. Then I thought I was fully awake so I opened the door a little bit and I realized that Matthew had come home and had just gone into the bathroom. I went and banged on the door but he was in the shower and didn't hear me. I went back into my bedroom and closed the door. I came back out later and saw him and I was furious with him for frightening him. I was yelling at him not to do that to me. that he had scared me because I wasn't expecting him home and then I hear these noises in the house and didn't know what was going on. I was ranting about it to him. This is uncharacteristic of me in waking life. I think he and Ashley B and another of their friends were getting ready to go back out. They were downstairs. I was taking empty boxes and throwing them as hard as I could downstairs. I was trying to get them to bang against the door or the wall at the bottom of the stairs so he would know just how angry I was. This time I wasn't angry because he had come home without telling me and frightened me. This time I was angry with him for leaving again, because he is never home, because the summer break is almost over and I feel as though I haven't seen him much during his break. I am very happy that he and Ashley B have found each other and are so happy together, but that has definitely taken time away from me. so that is difficult for me. It makes me feel as though I missed out on having the summer with him. There was a part of the dream where I was cleaning up the apartment and I had cleaned out my bedroom and was now working on my office. In the office there were a couple of piles of gifts that were wrapped and waiting for people. One pile was Matthew's birthday presents. Another pile was old Christmas presents that had not been delivered. I had been saving them for when I saw these people and I finally decided when I was cleaning up the room to just forget it. I didn't even remember what was in each one. I unwrapped them. I found a couple of sweaters. I thought they were nice, and realized that they were my size, so I decided to keep them for myself. Matthew was there at his current age and simultaneously at the age of 8 or 9. He came in with his bike helmet on. I knew that the older Matthew was cleaning out his room. I told the younger Matthew to check with the older Matthew to see if you need a new bike helmet. You could have the one he is getting ready to throw away or get rid of. Shortly after that, Jo V shows up. She tells me that she got the job here in the city where I live and that she is there to live with me for a few months. I was sitting in my easy chair in my office. It was sitting in the middle of the room. We both held out our arms for a hug, and she kind of jumped on me. as though we were celebrating. I think she was actually just leaning over to hug me. It tipped the chair over backwards. We were laying on the floor laughing. The older Matthew came in to see what was going on. I told him that Jo V had gotten the job and was going to be staying with me for a few months. I took her into my bedroom to show her how I had been cleaning up and cleaning out and getting ready for her. Darren showed up. When I opened the front door he was standing there and I could see that he was upset. It turns out that he was upset about the letter that he needs to sign for my name change. He came in, something about him climbing in bed with me, and he was mad because I wouldn't be intimate with him. He ended up leaving. I don't know if this is another part or another dream. I think it was related to my having a lot of difficulty waking up this morning. I was at DVC. I was having a lot of trouble staying awake. I was waiting for someone there. I think I had an appointment. Because I was having so much trouble staying awake they thought I was ill. They were trying to help me. I decided that I just needed to go home. So they were going to find someone to take home since it was not safe for me to drive like that. They helped me into a chair, but I slid way down almost out of the chair as I was falling asleep. Then they came and got me up and took me outside. As I reached the grass I slumped down into the grass on my stomach and fell asleep. They got me under a tree and then were going to go get someone else to help them. They got two men that worked in the warehouse, doing shipping etc. One of these men came out and took him into the warehouse. I think he was having me wait there until he could take me home. This woman inspector came from some kind of agency. This made everyone very nervous and they were worried about her seeing me lying there asleep. One of the men was going to hide me in between these boxes and hope that she wouldn't find me there. I noticed a very large empty box and started to climb inside it. There were two men standing there talking about whether or not that was a good idea. Then I saw another very long box that I could lie down in. There was also something about a long, flat box that was about the width and depth of a briefcase but maybe 5-6 feet long. You could put this box into a briefcase and pull the briefcase together to make it easier to carry the box."
"0459"	"(2002-08-01)"	"There were mice in the apartment. Along one of the walls I could see the hole and I could see them coming in and out. They were different colors. I was surprised, actually, that I was not reacting to them in the way I would have thought I would, being that aware of mice in the house. I didn't seem as frightened or put-off by them. In waking life I am extremely edgy around mice, rats, and snakes."
"0460"	"(2002-08-04)"	"I recited two poems from the top of my head, my own poems. The end had some extraordinary thoughts. Perhaps I should use the word intense."

He showed up and she was talking about that with him and he said it was all my fault, that I kept coming on to him. I tried to push it off on him. For some reason, to make amends, I had to paint all these walls. They didn't have a ceiling. It was as if I was floating or flying. I could paint the tops of the walls."
"0463"	"(2002-08-06)"	"Richard K was there. It was a prearranged marriage. We were told that we had to marry and yet it wasn't. We were someplace with a large group of people when we got married. Yet, it was as if it was secretive. I got a letter from Uncle J and Aunt A. In it was a schedule showing me when I was going to be able to live with Richard K. I was only going to be able to be with him February through September. I thought, That's only 8 months of the year and none of the winter holidays. This is very sketchy. Maybe he was going to be living with them year round and I could only live with them those 8 months. When we were packing and getting ready to leave this place. I had been rooming with another woman. She was already packed and had taken her bags out. There were a lot of electronics that I had to pack. I don't know what they were, but they were small."
"0464"	"(2002-08-07)"	"I was sitting at a computer, looking for a place to live in CO. It was as though I had an arial view of the city. I think I was using the mouse to move around and get different views, different angles, or maybe see different parts of the city. I was now in the air moving over the city, moving around the city. Homer Simpson was now with me. We were looking over the city and I was thinking that it wasn't such a bad city. I noticed some of the architecture. I thought some of the buildings were very cool. One building in particular looked like the whole thing was a fountain. It had water running down the sides of the building. I think it was a hospital. There was something about a motorcycle in this."
"0465"	"(2002-08-08)"	"Jo V moved in with me at 2 am one morning. I didn't realize that she had until someone told me. It seems as though I went to the backroom, of the show Cheers. Carla came back. It was really a mess. There was stuff everywhere, stuff all over the floor, paper all over the floor. I was trying to clean up and Carla was trying to help me. There were playing cards all over the floor. She was picking them up and putting them together. I said, No. No. There are different kinds so we have to sort them by deck. We started sorting them. Now we were in this large house. It was an older house, very cool house, with many rooms. I went to this one room that was being used for storage. I could hardly get the door open. There were all kinds of Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney things in there. I thought it was very cool. I suggested to someone that we should use it to create a Mickey Mouse Room or something similar. When I heard that Jo V had moved in, I went back to that room with the intention of clearing it out for Jo V to move into. She had already done that. It looked very nice. She had set up her computer equipment in a big, open room. It had three tables, set together in u formation. She had at least one very unusual piece. It was a rectangular computer screen, I think. Very long but not very high. There were several children. Jo V and I were showing them something on the computer. There was something about these children needing to go to bed or go to sleep. There was also something about criminals. Maybe they once owned the house and were now trying to get it back but weren't able to. At one point I may have been a teenager. I wanted to go someplace or with someone and was being told I couldn't. I was figuring out how I was going to sneak out and do what I wanted. I had this picture in my mind, being in the backyard of this house. The driveway curves around, up and goes to the back. I enter into a side door to go change my clothes. There was also something about bars on the windows and about Matthew moving out of the house to go to school."

"0470"	"(2002-08-10)"	"Lots of wild scenes from the old I Love Lucy show. I was living with them. We were in their apartment and, I think it was mostly Lucy, but there were many of us there. We were all creative type people. I'm thinking maybe artists or some type of designers. I had a pile of my work that had been set aside. People had been setting it aside and not paying much attention to it. Finally someone said something about my work and that someone in particular had really liked it. Lucy spoke up and affirmed that we needed to market my things more, that I really did have a lot to offer. I was doing this thing that I have done before in a dream, where I can suspend myself in the air a few feet off the floor, with intention. I am able to do it much longer than most people. Carmen A was there. I know she wants to fly, so I told her that she and I should practice this more. I said the more we practice the longer we will be able to stay in the air and the longer we are in the air the more it will feel like flying. I picked up my work because other people were being critical. Their criticism made me decide that I needed to leave this group. They weren't supporting me and they weren't giving me the energy I needed to follow and use this work for others. When I left the group Lucy was now someone else but I don't know who. I don't have a name or image. Maybe an angel? I have no idea why I would think that. When I took my work and left her apartment because of the lack of support I was receiving from the group, I moved into a separate apartment or. At this point it seemed like a hotel room. I left the room for a little while. When I returned in the evening I found 3-4 female artists there. They all seemed to be dressed in black and white. I was surprised to see them there because I thought this was my private space that I had retreated to when I left the group and that lack of support. They didn't actually apologize for being there but they said they hoped I wouldn't mind. I realized that the same person owned this space and for that reason these other people had keys. Even though I had tried to leave the group so I could be alone and nurture my gift, my creativity, my uniqueness, my individuality. These other people followed. They wanted to leave the group also and were coming to me because they felt some type of solidarity with me and/or my work. I went out and started doing more work and it was becoming more and more accepted and appreciated. More and more of the people from the original group were coming to me and affirming my work. I heard that Lucy's original group had decided to disband. She was going to bring a new group of people together. Some would be from the old group. I was to be a major part of this new group. She wanted to start promoting my work more. I said that I wanted to do an elf portrait [not a typo] where my hands would be covering my eyes to protect my inner self. My hands are covering my eyes because I do not want to see, And my knees are pulled up to my chest to protect my inner self, And as I am stretching out my hands and my legs, I begin to intentionally explore and develop my inner being in the world around me as I experience it. As I experience the world around me, I experience my inner self. As I experience my inner self more intentionally, I more fully experience the outer world. I also did a creative piece of a tree. There was a poem that I created and recited about this tree and as soon as I did I felt the ground slowly and dramatically. Then I lifted my head and I said, I need to write that down. I didn't write it down in the dream. I simply recited it. This was the poem. As a tree I stand tall and I weather the wind and the snow. And as the rain falls, my leaves and my branches absorb its nourishment and it helps me to grow. As the sun beats down I dry and I become withered and wilted. The rain comes again. My Branches begin to flourish and I begin to bud. The sun shines warmly upon me. I move gently with the wind. The fullness of my beauty begins to develop. Someone noticed that when I put myself in the physical position of my self-portrait that my index fingers were pointing up. They thought it meant something about. I don't remember now exactly but I interpreted it to mean something about spirituality. I said, but that's exactly me. My life journey is this intentional exploration and development of self and spirituality and how do I better explore and understand myself through my dreams and through spirituality and how do I help others with this path? As I was saying this it was as if there was a film of pictures depicting spirituality. Though they were abstracts, they seemed to be. I say it was a film but they seemed to be moving vertically up this wall. The image was similar to that of a film being projected onto a screen. They weren't actually pictures hanging on a wall, but rather just the images moving quickly up the wall from the bottom to the top and then disappearing into the ceiling. They were moving fairly quickly, though you could still see the images and you could see that they were all individual pictures. The colors were all very soft. The backgrounds were all white. They all had a lot of white space on them."
"0471"	"(2002-08-11)"	"I was working for SVH. I had two sons. One was Matthew's current age and one much younger. They were helping me get things ready so I could leave for the day and part of it was reconciling the cash. The boys were arguing about something. I told the older one that he needed to be patient with the younger one, because even the older one was getting impatient with me at that time about wanting to do things differently than I wanted him to. That's what was happening with the little one also. The older one was hassling him, trying to make him do it a certain way. I said to the older one, but you're getting upset with me right now for the very same thing. You don't want me to show you how I want it done or how it needs to be done. You want me to just let you do it your way. When we were in our car, ready to go home, it was just Matthew at his current age and myself. We were driving a pickup truck. He started to back up and I started saying, The gate is down! The gate is down! I had to say it 4-5 times before he stopped. By the time he stopped it was too late. He had hit another vehicle so the gate lifted the other car, moved it over a bit, and pushed it back. In doing so, he hurt two other boys. One was Matthew's current age. The other was the age of the younger Matthew in the dream earlier. The younger one wasn't seriously injured but the older one was fighting for his life, he was unconscious. The doctors and nurses kept telling me that they didn't know if he would pull through or not. I didn't want to leave the hospital because I was so worried about the boy and I was frustrated with Matthew. I felt it happened because of a typical behavior of his, not listening to words of caution, thinking that he already knows best. Until something happens, he tends to have to learn his lessons the hard way. I was frustrated because I didn't want someone to have to lose their life before Matthew would start driving more carefully and about being more open to other people's advice. I was very concerned and upset. I took to the younger boy and asked him if he believed in God. His grandmother was there. One of them said that they did. I was cleaning the equipment around the older boy's bed. Something I did seemed to make a difference. There seemed to be a turn for the better. As I was cleaning I kept praying and praying asking God to please let him pull through. Part of me felt as though I was praying for the boy for the wrong reason. I really wanted him to pull through for himself and for his family, but also for Matthew. I felt really bad about what happened and because Matthew is my son. Even though he is 19, I still feel very responsible for him and the person he is and his behavior. From that respect I felt horrible about what happened. So I was praying for our sake as well. Whatever I did caused a slight improvement. The doctors were still telling us to be very cautious and not get overly optimistic. He said it was a good sign but it did not mean that he was completely out of danger. The little boy said he saw his brother holding out his hand for him and he thought that meant that he was going to be okay. I wanted to say to the boy, you know, if you see him holding out his hand, maybe that means that God is holding out his hand for your brother, and we should take comfort in that. It doesn't matter if God is going to walk him home to heaven or walk him home to you. We should take comfort that God is going to walk with him. But I didn't say it because I wasn't sure if it was an appropriate thing for me to say. Would it be appropriate for me to say as the person I was in the dream and am now? Would it be appropriate for me to say as a spiritual director? Does it make a difference? I knew some of the nurses and other employees because I worked there. We were going to start having monthly movie nights at our department, or center, where we work. We may have just done one. I think it may have been two connected departments and I worked in the other. I was going to be in charge of this with a couple of nurses from the other department. That particular time we had done it in their department. I was walking around, cleaning up, sweeping the floors. There was something about the fact that we shouldn't spend our time doing that. I thought I should be able to do that if I wanted to. It makes things look better and I don't mind sweeping up after someone else. There was a discussion about that room not being very important compared to what we do. Maybe even that didn't support our basic philosophies or values. I'm not sure I understand that. I continued to sweep and clean up. In fact, in the one area where the other nurses were, there were doors open and I was trying to sweep some of the leaves up and outside. The leaves were blowing in and around the room. It didn't seem to bother me. I was aware of it, but it wasn't frustrating me that more leaves kept blowing back in. I thought I would just do the best that I could. I had moved back to my area and was sweeping one of the rooms there. I thought the room I was in would be a nice place to have the monthly movie nights and that I should check with my manager to see if they would mind that. It's a room that we could stretch out; maybe even lay on the floor. I was thinking how comfortable the basic plastic molded chairs in this room would be compared to the student chairs with desktops that were in the other room. Then I thought maybe not. At first I had the impression that it was carpeted but it wasn't. I started to wonder if there was a screen in there that we could show the movie on. I don't think there was and I didn't know what would be involved in getting one in there. I finally decided it would just be best to continue using the room that we had used. Somehow I knew that Br. Barry had been brought in on this conversation about to sweep or not to sweep. It seems that he could see where we were both coming from, and didn't really see the problem if I had the time or even if I wanted to do it on my own time. I realized that no one had been talking to the older boy who had been hurt. I thought maybe I should go tell his younger brother that he should go talk to him. Some people believe that people who are unconscious or in a coma can hear you talk to them or that it does make a difference in their recovery. I thought it might be good for the younger boy as well, to talk to his brother. Then I thought I should tell Matthew that as well. Matthew should go talk to the young man and make his peace with the situation in case the boy didn't make it. I didn't think Matthew had any idea it would be for him if this young man doesn't pull through. I felt it was very important that he go talk to him, to apologize, or whatever else he felt he needed to say. Again, I didn't know if that was appropriate to tell the two of them to go talk to them. I was in training to become a doctor. I was seeing this patient, even though I realized that I had two more years before I would actually be a doctor. I was referring to myself as a doctor to her. It wasn't until later that I realized that was inappropriate and I should clarify to her that I still had two more years of education. Whatever her problem was, I had taken care of it for her. I had gone into this classroom where we were later going to be viewing a movie together. The mother of the woman whom I had treated, or spoken with, was there. She was waiting for her daughter so they could go home. Ben D was in this room. I was excited to see him there. I was debating what I should say to him, should I express my personal interest, was there something that I could say to get him to ask me out. I just tried to be very kind, friendly, and not overly so. I was surprised that he was there. I learned that he had come to attend a lecture and that he does this quite often. So then I thought I should tell him if he is ever in the city where I live that he should give me a call and we could have dinner, similar to what he had said to me in waking life. I went into the room a few times and chatted with him briefly. The mother of this woman that I had treated was there also. I finally realized that Ben D was hanging around to take her to dinner after her daughter was finished there. This disappointed me, that he was there to socialize with this other woman, and he wasn't expressing any additional interest in seeing me socially. I was stewing over this, wondering if there was anything that I could or should do or say. I was contemplating how I was feeling about this experience and what, if anything, I should do. The young man did die. As soon as Matthew heard, he broke down in tears. He was very upset. I had not had the opportunity to suggest that he talk to the young man, even though the young man was in a coma. We were at home and Matthew was in the shower trying to relax. I was going to go rub his back or something to help him relax. I had a method or ritual or something to try to help him relax. aromatherapy, music, etc. It occurred to me that some people might find this inappropriate but since we were both in bathing suits I decided that it was fine. I knew how upset Matthew was and I wanted to help him. but myself as well because I was also very upset by the whole thing. Prior to this, there were approximately 20 workmen outside of my house doing some repairs. They had finished their work. On the kitchen counter there was a 1 _ inch to 2-inch gap between the cabinet and the counter. kind of like a hole. It was probably 12 inches long but it was arched. I thought it was terrible. One of them said there was nothing that could be done. I was going to talk to one of the other workers to verify that or to find someone who could fix it. Then there were even more people there. People that I knew. They wanted to know about this ritual that I use for relaxation. They wanted to witness it. They were waiting for me to prepare everything. Probably 15 of them were waiting outside. It was very hot, so they had removed their shirts. I had gone out for a minute. I jokingly said something about fifteen shirtless men sitting in my front yard and that not happening very often. They all laughed. I had some of the people helping me collect candles. My shower was something like you would see in a health club. It was almost like three shower stalls, divided, but the partition-dividers were clear so you could see through them, and they were long and narrow. Lots of people had gathered in these three shower stalls to watch the ritual. They were all clothed. They didn't seem to be showering, but the water was on. They were sitting in a row, because the stalls were long and narrow and they couldn't stand or sit 2 or 3 people across. I told them that to do the ritual I would need all of the people out of there. They all cleared out and were helping me put the candles in but they were putting them in the wrong places. In the one shower stall that I was going to be using there were quite a few plants on the one end, ivy and hanging plants, etc. I was placing the candles very carefully so they wouldn't light the plants on fire. I had them replace some of the candles because I only wanted candles that were either white or very dark colors such as maroon, green and navy. There was also a man in there filming it. But he was filming it while all the other people were in there. I said, I do believe it may be useful for people to have a video of this ritual because they could see it being performed and learn to use it for themselves or their loved ones. However, I think it should be done right if you are going to do it. He found a blank tape that was a minute or two long. I told him that wasn't really going to do much good. Then he found another one that was much longer. I had two women friends, close to me. I didn't have a place to change into my swimsuit. There were so many people around I couldn't find a private place to change. I thought I had found a place but then that didn't work out. Then all these men and some other people decided they would create a barrier for me by surrounding me, with their backs to me, so I could change. I did that. Two of the women who were particularly close to me were trying to help me. I wanted to slip it down over my head and they said that wouldn't work. They said I wouldn't be able to keep myself covered that way so I stepped into the swimsuit and pulled it up. I removed my top while they simultaneously pulled my swimsuit up. This worked very well. I went into the shower. When Matthew came in he was a very small child, maybe only one year old. I'm not sure he could even sit up by himself. I was sitting on the floor of the shower and he was sitting with me, between my legs but facing away from me, as a parent and child might sit on the floor when playing. I was bathing him and all the candles were lit."
"0472"	"(2002-08-13)"	"Jennifer K had called to ask me for some information, if I remembered much about canoeing on the Whitewater River. She thought she remembered their being some places that were steep, uphill, that were very difficult paddling and also severe turns. I didn't recall that and also told her that the furthest I recall canoeing there was beginning in BR and going just south of her parent's house. Her and I and a friend of ours made arrangements for a weekend outing. I think it was going to include this canoeing. I don't know if it was just one day or a weekend. We arrived at this place. It almost looks like several highway interchanges criss-crossing over, under and around each other. They had cement walls along the outside. Some people were setting up tables along these walls, like card table and chairs. It was to solicit business from pedestrians or people walking by. The one man I knew. As I waiting for Jennifer C and the other girl I went and sat down across from him. Then I said, Oh. I'm sorry I won't do that. I don't want people to think you're busy. I don't want to cost you any business. Jennifer C and this other girl showed up and we were sitting our things in piles along these walls. These two friends of hers show up and the original three of us start discussing splitting the cost. We realized that these two friends of this other girl were there to share the outing as well. So one of us said something about us splitting the cost five ways now. The one girl said, No. My agreement with the two of you was that we would split it three ways. So we will still do that. I will split my third three ways with my two friends. This bothered me, as it didn't seem right. Even though we had an agreement to split it three ways, it seemed that if we now had five people, the most fair thing was to split the cost five ways. As it turned out, none of the three of them spent any time with Jennifer C and I. I'm alone again, still on these ramps, waiting for Jennifer C. There were two car crashes. The one man that I had gone to sit with at his table was Asian and someone that I knew. The first car accident struck him and it severely severed his leg. I don't think it completely severed it and it was low on the leg. He shows up later in a cast and on crutches. When the second crash occurs, it completely severs a man's leg, very near the hip. He is yelling and carrying around, not over pain, but more angry at the inconvenience of it. The Asian man brings a kitchen-size wastebasket over for the man to prop his hip on to catch the blood. The other part of his leg flew off somewhere. He was yelling something about a brother, that he thought was somehow responsible for this because he was covering for his brother and if he hadn't been covering for his brother he wouldn't have been there and it wouldn't have happened. I don't remember the details clearly. He seems to be more upset about that than the pain. I'm not sure but I think I was thinking that I have wondered before if there is a place in BR that I can get on the Whitewater or that there was a waterway that I could get on in BR. I wasn't sure if it was Whitewater and/or I wasn't sure where it would lead me if I did get it on it where I was thinking about getting on it in BR. I was talking to some of these people at these ramps, the Asian in particular, about that. Somehow these ramps had something to do with that. He said, Whenever I've taken the one that I thought was the right one, that it always led me where I expected it to. Somehow I had the sense led to where I was talking about. I walked down the ramp to one point. I had some sense that the Asian man was right, but yet I still felt pretty uncomfortable with it. So I just walked back up and decided to wait for Jennifer C. This man with the severed leg. I don't know if there was just a mess surrounding him or if I just realized that it was a dangerous area. I picked up my and Jennifer C's things and moved them to another area. Then when she finally returned I told her that I had moved this stuff. Two of the things were nail clippers and manicure scissors. It was all just very small things, like toiletry things. Her and I were sitting there talking. She asked for my thoughts on the outing, especially as it pertained to these other three women. I shared with her what I thought. I returned home and I realized that I didn't ask Jennifer C for her take on the situation. I decided that I would send her a thank you note and tell her that I enjoyed spending the time with her and acknowledge that I had not asked her opinion of the situation. I would apologize for that in the note and ask her to let me know her thoughts."
"0473"	"(2002-08-13)"	"I received an email response from Bill C to an email that I had sent him earlier today in waking life."
"0474"	"(2002-08-27)"	"I was at the office with Bill C. He asked me if I wanted to go to lunch and discuss things. I said, sure. He headed out the door, but I went into my office to get my suit jacket. He turned around and saw I wasn't behind him. He asked if I was coming. I said yes. I had something very large in my hand but I don't know what it was. I put my jacket on and headed out the door. I'm now at a post office. I see a man named Scott. I knew him but don't know who it is in waking life. He's a new member of CRHP XII. We were exchanging pleasantries, etc. Helen J comes in. I act very excited to see her. I approach her, give her a hug, we chat. I turned around and said, Oh, have you met Scott? She said she had not. I told her that he is our newest CRHP XII member. I introduced them. They were now chatting and a couple more of my CRHP sisters came in. I jokingly asked if someone had made arrangements for CRHP to meet at the post office. Anne C was one of the ones who had just come in. I don't know who the others were. I gave her a hug and chatted with her a bit. She looked different than she does in waking life."
"0475"	"(2002-08-27)"	"WNA, where I live, was either having a sale or giving away decorative grasses. I'm not sure which. It was for residents that wanted them to decorate their patios. There was a wide variety available. My initial reaction is that I was kind of excited about it, and thought it was cool that they were doing this. I have wished I had the space to use decorative grasses, but the flowerbeds on my patio are simply too small. I decided not to take advantage of the offer."
"0476"	"(2002-08-27)"	"It was Wednesday and I was sitting in the living room, eating dinner while watching TV. Matthew came in. It startled me because I wasn't expecting him home. He had a laundry basket in his hand. He said, Hi mom! He told me that one of his friends was coming home that evening so he decided to ride along to come and pick up his car. I think his friend's name was Doug. I appreciated this because that would keep me from having to drive up to get him on Thursday evening and bring him back to get his car. After he walked out of the room I realized I was sitting there without a blouse on, so I grabbed a round laundry basket and held it up in front of myself and went upstairs to put a blouse on before Matthew realized I had been sitting there like that."
"0477"	"(2002-08-30)"	"There were a lot of people. I got a pair of shoes out of the refrigerator and was going to put ice cubes in each one. When I got ready to do that I realized that the pair I had was not a pair after all. the shoes did not match. Mother and Daddy were sitting across the room from me. It was a very large room. Daddy said, do you see five spiders there around you? There was someone else close to me and that she said yes. He counted them. We realized they were hidden microphones. Someone was spying on us. They were very, very tiny. They looked like little black dots. Two of them were in the air in front of me. I tried to use one of my ice cubes and swat at it. I missed. I heard mother say, Anna. Anna."
"0478"	"(2002-08-31)"	"Darren took Matthew shopping for an apartment of his own. They found one and signed a lease. They started moving in before Matthew had even talked to me about it. I was very upset and not even talking to Matthew. I was even taking his calls."
"0479"	"(2002-08-31)"	"Taking a nap at Mother and Daddy's house on the sofa. People coming in and out of the room. Trying to get them to help me wake up. I could overhear them laughing at me for moving my hands around in my sleep. Tried to decide whether to continue to signal for their help and have them keep laughing at me or stop trying so they would stop laughing.  "
"0480"	"(2002-08-31)"	"I was part of a team trying to catch a killer. He had killed a child in some violent manner. At one point we thought we had him, brought in a team, surrounded him, put him in constraints, etc. took him away. Turned out he had managed to substitute his people for our without our knowledge and it was his own people that had taken him away. preparing meeting to discuss everything that had happened from the first murder forward so we could plan how to prevent other such incidents. One member of team had prepared detailed report for the meeting and brought it to me, with multiple copies. I had to explain to her that the purpose of this meeting was not to take the next step or plan the next step with this particular case or incident. Part of my involvement was individual interaction with this killer. That was, at least in part, a conversation in a small portable room in the middle of a school gymnasium."
"0481"	"(2002-09-01)"	"Went to see the condo I used to own at North Point Bay. I went down to the end of the drive/street and then began to back into the driveway of my old driveway or the one next to it. I realized I couldn't or shouldn't as the current owners were there. There was some kind of community picnic going on. The residents were participating in special activities. I was trying to walk through. not sure where I was going. and trying to stay out of the way. There was something to do with me climbing up a tall ladder or something and something to do with a swimming pool or water. I noticed two attractive men sitting and talking. As I walked by, one nudged the other and said they should try to chat with me. I turned around and smiled. He then asked me if I lived there and I said no. I turned around and kept walking, wondering if I should go back and talk with them more or if they would come after me to try to talk with me. They didn't."
"0482"	"(2002-09-02)"	"I was putting up a few Christmas decorations on top of a large wooden piece of furniture. It was primarily a wooden sled, not solid wood but rather looked like a frame of sled for lack of a better description; some reindeer and they had lights on them. I offered to put them up for a neighbor as well. He declined because of the time of the year. I thought this was quite odd for me, also. I usually put my tree and decorations up the weekend after Thanksgiving and take them down a day or two after Christmas. I was picking up the newspapers in the yard for two of the neighbors. They had come apart a bit so I was sorting the sections and making sure each neighbor got all the sections they were supposed to. Bev's children were going to spend the weekend with me. It ended up that Rachel S was there 1-2 nights early to spend the night. She was at the top of the steps and asked if she could play Nintendo. I told her it was bedtime. I went up to tuck her back in bed and Bev was there too. She was saying that she needed to head for home. I told her that it was so late, about 11 pm, so I thought she should spend the night and drive home in the morning. Otherwise she would be driving until 1 or 1:30 am. I don't know what she decided to do. Rachel S came downstairs in her pajamas. I picked her up to take her back up to bed. I was noticing that she had gained a lot of weight and I felt bad for her. I was thinking about the difficulty all of my siblings and I have in maintaining our weight. it is a constant battle for all of us. I had taken Rachel S to preschool or something and I went into the room to pick her up after. I had a coffee cup with my name on it. Anna. I sat it down on a shelf with all of the children's cups. I went back in a few minutes later to pick it up and it wasn't there any longer. Someone said they thought they knew where it was and they went to get it. I saw an old friend and we were chatting. I said something about talking with or seeing Susan J. She said she would have liked to see her too. I said that I might arrange that the next time. I went to Mass. There were many people coming in at one time. I wanted to sit in one of the back seats because I knew I had to leave at 9:30 am. I chose one seat and when I knelt down I could not put my legs straight back. As soon as I had the opportunity I got up and moved up a few rows further. Someone was talking to Jerry Lewis about his diet and he showed them a storage room where he kept all of his favorite diet foods. It was a very large room with a high ceiling. It had large, commercial-size containers of everything, like they would have at places that serve food to large groups. I saw large jars of what appeared to be olive pieces for salads. I thought that was a good idea. Something new I could put on my salads. Susan J, Marlene F, and myself were all grocery shopping together. All of the things we were selecting from were these dietary things of Jerry's. I had several bags of potato chips in my cart. I thought this might be a nice change for me if they are good for his diet, they might be good for mine."
"0483"	"(2002-09-03)"	"The crash of United flight #93 and other 911 events."
"0484"	"(2002-09-04)"	"I was at my SDI at the BE Retreat Center but it looked different than it does in waking life. The people weren't all the same. Sister Betty was there. There was a man that it seems as though I knew but I now can't remember who he was. For some reason I was feeling ill or out of place. Whatever it was I didn't want to explain to people what was making me feel the way I was. I was also saying that it was just going to take time for me to start feeling normal. It reminds me of one of the medications that the doctor had me on and the withdrawal symptoms I experienced when I tried to quit the medication, before I finally started feeling better. That is what the physical feelings remind me of. Some of the people there, especially this one man, were involved in the occasional use of recreational drugs. I wouldn't have anything to do with it. He was saying that a lot of the people there had used this drug and as a result they were being very silly. They seemed to be having a lot of fun, but I still didn't want any part of it. There was another, younger man, there that was being referred to as second-in-line to this other man. He was referring to himself the same way. We were having a meal and he was telling me how frustrated and discouraged he felt that something he had done had been rejected by the administrators there. It was some kind of a project he had done thereor something similar. I took my dishes to the clean-up counter. There were tall piles of dishes everywhere. I was trying to find a place to set mine so they would not fall or cause one of these piles to fall. People had left a lot of food on their plates. Some of it was spaghetti."
"0485"	"(2002-09-05)"	"Matthew and I were on a train. He was younger than in waking life. maybe 9 or 10 years old. The train was headed south. We were sleeping. The cars we were on were more like carrier cars. long, flat, and narrow with no structure to them. no walls, seats, etc. I thought they were probably too narrow for Matthew and I too lay side by side so he was lying ahead of me. At times I was in a semi-waking state. I could hear them making announcements and such. They were talking about various trains in the south, and their appeal to families for vacations because of their childlike nature. They were designed to look like various animals and characters. They were also talking about an upcoming trip that was $900 for 8 days, or nights. I thought this was a great deal and maybe something I would be able to afford if things go well will my job. At first I was thinking it would be $900 for the both of us then I realized that was silly for me to think that, that of course it would be $900 for each of us. Still the idea appealed to me. At that point I fully woke up and was looking around me and wondering where we were. I saw a professional football team practicing. Their uniforms were gold and maroon and they were called the cougars. A little while later I saw another football team practicing. Their shirts were maroon and they were also called the cougar. I saw one member of the flag corp with a flag. As they moved the flag into an upright position I could see that it said, Gould High School. At first I thought this was the same team as the first, but later realized they were two different teams. The train seemed to go through factory lots and such. It was in one such lot that the train ride ended. I realized we had a problem because this was not where we wanted to be. I saw a man walking around on the grounds so I got his attention and asked him where we could catch another train. He headed to a door to an UAW building. I told Matthew to walk faster because we didn't want to lose this man. We didn't seem to have any luggage or anything. We entered through one of a set of glass double doors. It was a very large room with shiny, clean grey floors, like you might see in a factory. At the end of the room I could see doors to two small rooms or offices. The man pointed down that way. At first I wasn't sure which door he was pointing to and then I saw a woman stand up from behind a desk. I recognized it as the same type of setting I had been in before regarding this train trip. Matthew and I went to that office. I walked in and asked where we could get on the next train headed north. She typed into her computer and then said, Kilamanjaro and pointed out a window to her left, our right. I asked how soon and got the impression it would be leaving very soon. I clarified and tried to get her to tell me clearly where we needed to go. She and/or I repeated something about Kilamanjaro one or two more times. I had the sense that where we needed to be was about ten minutes away. I was wondering where our luggage was, if we had any, and where our tickets were. I thought that I should probably have kept the tickets on my person. At this point I felt as though I was half-awake in waking life. I thought I was just lying in bed reviewing and remembering the dream, because I could hear my alarm clock playing. It had been playing for a half-hour or so. I didn't get up to turn it off because I knew I didn't really need to get up that early today. This is all very odd and I'm not sure how better to explain it. I recorded the dream clearly as I recall it, yet when I was still in bed, I was thinking about the dream and near the end was thinking this is going to be a problem, not knowing if we have luggage, if we do, where is it and how are we going to get it, where are our tickets, etc. Yet, I wasn't upset or panicked. I just realized that there was a problem. Maybe I wasn't upset because I also realized it was a dream."
"0486"	"(2002-09-12)"	"I was working at the CAS office, though it looked differently than it does in waking life. I had rearranged the space after Cole P and Terry D had left. I hung a large number of pictures on several of the walls. They went from midway up the wall almost to the ceiling in most areas. I had also moved my workspace to a different location. Cole P and Terry came in and were looking at the changes I made. They asked some questions about the pictures on the walls. I explained to them briefly what the pictures were and why they were where they were. I recognize that there were many pictures of me. not me by myself but of me with other people. I was explaining to them that these were pictures from my previous work experiences. As I was saying that, when we were standing in front of one wall, I realized that I wasn't being very honest with them about that one section. It occurred to me how many pictures of me were hanging there. Because I didn't want to give a bad impression, I explained to them that the one section of pictures was of past work experiences, when I don't think they really were. But I said it because it felt more valid to me to have them there if they were of past work experiences. I seemed to be taking care of some walk-in clients or customers while they were there. We got interrupted so I had to go take care of the client. I went to a desk that was not mine, got what I needed and took care of the client. I went back to Cole P and Terry. They were bringing things in for donation, so it now feels like NTNS. They were bringing in small piles of things and setting them on a table. Terry pointed out that one row of items were his. He said something about keeping them separate because of his wife and her wanting him to keep his things separate from Cole P. I then went back to my own desk to be able to take care of another client. I realized that while I liked my desk in the new area, purely from an aesthetic point of view, it was not going to be as convenient for taking care of clients. There was a difference in attitudes between Cole P and Terry. Maybe there were some hard feelings on Cole P's part because he may have had the sense that his departure wasn't totally his decision. He had felt the pressure, knew that Bill C was not satisfied with his performance. So even though he resigned, it may have been to avoid being fired. Terry was as friendly and pleasant as always."
"0487"	"(2002-09-06)"	"I was in a store of some kind. It might have been a ladies clothing store, or it may be that ladies clothing was just one of the things that they carried. Someone was working on a rack of clothes. I made a suggestion to them to turn the hangers the other way so it would work better."
"0488"	"(2002-09-07)"	"I was either in a hotel room or a second floor apartment. Bill C was there. I think Daddy was there. I may have just been talking to him. Sister Emma was in the dream at one point. Carmen A and Alison U were in the dream at one point. I think maybe two other people from school were in the dream. but I'm not sure. I said, Look did you see that Carmen A and Alison U are here? I must have said that to someone who knows them. Alison U was pregnant. In part of this dream Sister Emma lived on the 2nd floor of this apartment building or this hotel and there was a man living right beneath her on the first floor. At one point it seems that they traded places, maybe because of Sister Emma health. So she was now living, or staying on the first floor. The man was now living on the second floor. There were metal stairs leading to the second floor. I went up the stairs and it led to a roof, I think. They had taken and put a bunch of dirt and planted some trees so you weren't limited to. Maybe so you could only access one part of the roof. I just went up there and I looked around a little bit. I looked over the edge and down to the street level. Then I went back down. I think maybe I told someone that I just wanted the exercise. Now I'm living on the first floor I guess. There was something about Alison U having a doctor's appointment. She had four suitcases full of stuff, even though it was just an overnight doctor appointment. I was helping her carry all of her stuff. I am talking to Bill C and Cole P about cell phones. There was one kind of cell phone that Bill C was using. I said, Oh, yes, I have that exact same one at home. But this is the one I carry around with me. I pulled out my current phone. Bill C and Cole P both pulled there's out and we were all comparing. I was thinking that mine was little bit smaller and that mine was nicer than theirs but I didn't say that."
"0489"	"(2002-09-07)"	"I was driving in my car, from the backseat. I was having trouble seeing. I'm driving too fast. At the last minute I see that there has been a terrible accident and I see that there's all kinds of emergency vehicles. I slam on my brakes and I swerve way off the road. I'm trying to avoid hitting all of these vehicles. I'm expecting these emergency workers to get really angry with me. But it was almost as if no one even noticed because they were so busy taking care of the accident. I went ahead and tried to drive around the vehicles. I did drive around some of the vehicles that were parked there. I got around them. I think I backtracked. I had a very deja vu feeling to it. while I was still in the dream. I felt that I had either been there and done that before or maybe the feeling that I had dreamt it before."
"0490"	"(2002-09-07)"	"I was with a group of people. We were presenting some kind of a show or contest. I was going to be one of the announcers. When people came in and got settled I was going to first of all helping them to fill out their entry forms. for lack of a better word. I don't know what it was. I had some 3 x 5 cards. It would say something like, #1 and what it was. Then I would tell them what they should be filling in there. Like, a lot of them were just general what they should be filling in but some were very specific. So on some of them I was telling them a specific name to check or fill in. One of the items I didn't know what it was. It was a very strange word. It sounded something like, Imagonnagohome! So I was standing on this stage with a microphone. I was joking about it. When I first got started, the microphone that I was supposed to use wasn't working. Then I was supposed to be standing in front of the stage using this microphone. That microphone wasn't working so they brought me around and up on stage and gave me a different microphone. I was using that one and we were still having problems. I was making jokes to try to make light of the technical problems we were having. It was mostly men that I was working with. It seemed that I was observing these children of this wealthy man. He didn't have time for his children, so they were not well behaved. They were spoiled because he spent lots of money on them instead of spending time with them. They were going to play bride and groom. The young girl, she was very large and well developed for her age, was half-dresses in her wedding outfit. She kept yelling at the little boy to bring her dress. He wouldn't do it. Then I'm back at the event. I was going to lay down and watch the rest of it. This little girl is upset so she asks if she can lay there with me. I told her that she could. She or I one grab a pillow. She was going to come over and lay there with me to watch this event or program."
"0491"	"(2002-09-13)"	"Darren and I were still married. We were at a point of giving it one last chance. We were in bed. I decided to try one more time to be intimate with him. He did something that I really didn't like. I just pulled away and didn't say anything else to him. I was just going to go to sleep. He could tell that I really didn't like what he did. I didn't want to talk about it. I just knew that was it. I just couldn't stay with him. But I also didn't want to say that to him. I think eventually I did. He was talking to people like BJ, trying to get them to. I don't know if he was just telling her how upset he was or if he was hoping she could talk me into staying."
"0492"	"(2002-09-29)"	"I had this little thing that I was using for transportation. The thing that I was using was about 8-12 inches off the ground. It might have been two feet long and about a foot wide. You would wonder how anyone could possible sit on something with these dimensions but I was. It was white and it felt kind of like cement. It was shaped like a bread pan. hollow in the center. I put the open end on the bottom and I put a folded piece of fabric on the top to make it softer to sit on. It had a remote control that I used to propel it. It didn't seem to have a motor or anything so I don't know how the remote control could propel it but it did. I took it to a repair shop because it wasn't going as fast as it normally does. They were good-naturedly teasing or enjoying that I had this mode of transportation. The woman that checked me in, instead of writing up a ticket and giving it to the men to be repaired, she somehow repaired it herself. I don't think she even charged me for it. It seems that it was a very minor repair. While I was waiting I was wondering if I should get something else, like a moped. I knew that wasn't really what I wanted. I didn't want a two-wheel vehicle. A moped would be too much like a motorcycle for my taste. Then I realized that what would be ideal for me would be one of these scooters that they sell for people with physical problems getting around. I put it back on the ground and put my bundle of fabric on it and sat back down on it. It's so small I can't figure out how I could sit on it, keep my feet off the ground, keep my balance, or anything. I got on it. I was inside a building. I started going. I was going pretty fast, comparatively, through this building. I was turning corners very quickly and going through doors quickly. I was going so fast that I was concerned that I might fall off when making the turns. At this point I was in a YMCA. The children were watching me on it and they were pointing it out to their parents. saying how cool it was and that it would be even better than a skateboard. I am in the YMCA. I am sitting on a sofa next to Barry C. It seems that we're waiting on someone. He's trying to read the newspaper. It appears that he has Parkinson's Disease. It's what my parents generation used to call Palsy. He's trying to read the paper but he's shaking so much that he can't read it. he can't hold it still enough. I can tell he is getting very frustrated. I don't know if it is hands or his head that is shaking so much. I reach up to try to give his head something to lean against so it wouldn't be shaking so much. He jerked away from me. I thought, oh, he doesn't like that because it looked odd. Maybe if I just lean up against him so it will look like he is just resting his head against mine. When I tried to do that he pulled away again and looked at me as if to say, what are you doing? I said, I thought I would just give you a head to rest against. He didn't say anything but I could tell he didn't want to do that. Someone is giving a tour of the facilities. They are getting ready to do some major renovations and they are taking people on tours to show them what they are going to be doing. I went on the tour. We went through a couple of rooms. We also went to this outdoor space. It reminded me of a garden area - not a vegetable garden. more like a flower garden area, though not really that either. I went back inside. There were children all over the place. obviously. They were having a lot of fun. There were a lot of very unusual rooms. I don't want to say childlike. because they weren't childlike in a toddler kind of way. They were simply very fun looking rooms. Some of the children were smaller, 8- 10, and others were closer to teen years. I was wondering why Matthew didn't spend more time here when he was younger. I would think that he would have really enjoyed it. Some of the entrances weren't typical doors. You had to climb up on something and be able to keep your balance while you got the door open. There wasn't a door handle from the inside so I had to grab the bottom of the door and pull it close enough to me so I could grab the hook for the latchhook. I think I had a pillow and blanket that I was carrying with me while I was trying to get up and through this door. I wanted a drink of water so I went back outside to the garden area. There was an old-fashioned water pump that tapped into a natural spring. I decided to go over there to get a drink but I didn't. I did think that I would go tell Barry C that it was there. I don't remember much about what the rooms looked like. The one room, there seemed to be two doors that were white but they were trimmed in red. a pattern painted on them in red. There were two teenage girls running through that door. They were giggling and squealing the way girls that age do."
"0493"	"(2002-10-04)"	"I thought Matthew had come home late at night. While I heard him at the door I was trying to remember if I chained the door and set the alarm before I went to bed. I was pretty sure that I did so I didn't think he would be able to get in. I heard someone come in the front door and come up the steps. I thought it was Matthew because I thought I heard him calling me as he came up the steps so he wouldn't startle me by popping his head in my bedroom door. I thought I had my eyes open and was watching my bedroom door to show up but he never did. I lay there for a little while and still didn't see him show up at the doorway. I fumbled for the flashlight in my bedside table. This was one of those dreams that I was very sure that I was awake. I turned on my flashlight and pointed it toward my doorway and still didn't see anyone. I decided to go into his bedroom. I shone the flashlight around his bedroom and didn't see anything. I went over to his bed and started to feel around his bed. Even with the flashlight on I couldn't see very well. I remember thinking, oh, good, there isn't anyone in the apartment. Then suddenly I felt these fingers. It startled me so bad I jumped. That woke me up."
"0494"	"(2002-10-04)"	"A family member or a friend and myself were visiting some people in another town. I don't know the name of the town or even what state it was in. At one point during the dream it was winter and there was a lot of snow on the ground. While we were at this house, the wife was telling us about some chairs that her husband makes that are so soft and comfortable to sit in. She said people just love them. There was a pile of different size cushions sitting on the floor. Some were as small as 6 x 6. Others were large. the size of a regular chair cushion. She was explaining how her husband uses these different sizes to fit them in the frames of these chairs. I had grabbed one of the large ones and two of the small ones and was trying to find different ones that would work well to fill up the seat frame of this chair, but they didn't. Then, either someone told me or I realized that I was using the wrong thing. There were bundles of fabric sitting there. The fabrics were all accordion folded and then banded together so they would stay together. I don't know what they were banded with. The fabric itself felt really soft, like cashmere. They were different colors. They reminded me of winter scarves. I learned that was what he used to make these chairs. He just fit these bundles of fabric together. So, I started doing that, using those. They were different sizes and different colors. With those I was able to make a cushion of sorts on the seat frame of this chair. I commented that they reminded me of Matthew's red winter scarf, how they felt and how they looked. The chairs didn't have much of a back on them. The back was maybe only 6-8 inches high. I wondered how that would be comfortable. There was something besides just the frame but I don't know what or how. After I did get the frame of the chair filled in I sat down on it. It was comfortable. With the back the way it was it surprised me that it was as comfortable as it was. I don't know that it was as soft or as comfortable as I expected it to be from what I had been told. But it was comfortable. It struck me as odd that that was how he made these chairs. that he didn't use any kind of covering for these bundles of fabric. He just put those in there and that was that. There was someplace that I either needed to go, wanted to go, or simply decided to go to. I asked someone to give me a ride and then did. I don't remember where it was. After I was ready to return I just walked. I realized that it was just about a two-block walk and that it was silly for me to have someone drive me there previously. It wasn't snowing then. The weather was nice. I don't remember it being cold. I was back at the house and I decided it was time to go. Whoever it was that was with me, family member or friend, - we got ready to go and they and I disagreed on the path to get home. the route we needed to take to get home. They were going to go one way and I was going to go another. Somehow we kept ending up at the same place. either because we couldn't get through the way we wanted. I was standing there and there was a local town person there telling us to wait for this small train. I don't know if we missed the train or if the train neglected to stop. It was now snowing and the weather was really bad. The train was the type of train that you might see in an amusement park. it reminded me of the old train at Lesourdesville Lake."
"0495"	"(2002-10-12)"	"I was asking someone how to do something. There was something that I was supposed to do and I was trying to find out what it was but I didn't. I was trying to do something and was asking someone to tell me how, or trying to ask someone,. I was trying to get the answer and still didn't."
"0496"	"(2002-10-13)"	"I was in Hawaii with my husband. My husband was Craig T. Nelson, from TV. We were at an outdoor cafe or restaurant. We were sitting at a small square table, for two or four, I'm not sure which. We were sitting across the table from each other. The waiter at one point brought some lobster. He said he had two for each of us. I said, oh no, one is more than enough for me. He went ahead and gave me two of them, or he gave me one and gave Craig my second one. We were eating this lobster. We were very much in love and being very affectionate. I decided that when the waiter came back I was going to ask him to move my place setting to the side of the table so I could sit closer to Craig. They were also playing Island music. At one point it was very, very fast. At this point it was as if I had a bird's eye view of the island. I could almost see it vibrating, see the earth vibrating. I said, Gosh. If they keep this up they are going to create a whole separate island. There also seemed to be a child, maybe 9 or 10 years old, maybe younger, I don't know. I don't know who the child with. He had been putting food down this hole in the ground. He had been doing it because he realized that there were people living down where this hole led. So he was giving them food. When Craig realized that he had discovered this people in there, he told the boy not to tell anyone. that it would have to be our secret. When I looked at the whole, it was as though you were looking into someone's basement. You could see a tile floor that you might see in a home basement. That's where these people were. I have the sense that they weren't supposed to be there but they were living there and hoping not to be discovered."
"0497"	"(2002-10-13)"	"I thought Matthew had come home. He was working in his bedroom, cleaning out his closets and such. He was carrying stuff outside. I went upstairs to talk to him. I wanted to talk to him alone. I wanted to ask him if he and I would ever have the chance to talk alone anymore, since he has been dating Ashley B. It seems that I never have anytime to talk to him alone. I never have anytime alone with him at all. I got very upset with him, but I'm not sure why. It may have been related to church, but I'm not sure. It also seems that I thought one of the maintenance men from WN was there working on the apartment but I don't know what he was doing. He had left the screen door open. Another time he was doing something upstairs and had the water running. it was leaking through the ceiling to the first floor. I felt frustrated with him and told him what was happening. I also had this sense, and I don't know where this fits. it may be something separate. I really wanted to wake up but couldn't. I had reached out to the coffee table and was pulling myself, trying to pull myself to wake myself up."
"0498"	"(2002-10-17)"	"This is very sketchy but important. It had something to do with the CAS office. My sense is that there were people who came to work there but either decided that they couldn't do the job, so they left, simply because they knew they couldn't or because they knew they couldn't and they wanted to make the decision to leave before they were asked to leave. There were people who couldn't do the job and were asked to leave, or maybe it was suggested that they leave. It wasn't the typical office setting. I have this picture in my mind of people along two opposing walls. They aren't really standing in a row. they are but there is a significant space between each one. as though there is a room for a desk between each of them. They are just standing there. I don't remember any furniture in the room. It seems that it had something to do with changing clothes. Maybe I was changing clothes. I realized. Or. I don't know. For some reason I'm noticing about the fact that I have shaved off my pubic hair. The only reason I notice is that I'm looking at my pubis and thinking, What is Doctor Pf going to think when I go in for my annual exam and sees that I've shaved off all of my pubic hair?"
"0499"	"(2002-11-24)"	"I think I was looking outside or I was looking outside through the window of a city building. We see one of the twin towers explode. not like it did in waking life. It was more like. It just exploded and pieces flew everywhere. All of us ran outside. I was just walking around outside on the cement. I was just wandering around very listless because I thought Matthew was in that building or I knew there was a good chance that he was in that building. At first a bunch of people started towards the tower, towards that area. Then other structures started being attacked and exploding, I guess. It was like it was moving towards us. Whatever was causing these explosions was moving towards us. It had caused. Like a flood. I was wandering around on the cement. I decided to just let the flood drown me because if Matthew had died I didn't want to live. I don't know if I changed my mind myself or if someone else convinced me that there was a chance that he was still alive and if there was even a chance that he was still alive I needed to try to save myself. So someone had pointed to a large building and they directed us to go in there. After we went in, we went up a few floors and someone was saying that this building was safe because it was a very new building and it had been built with new materials and new technology and whatever so that it would withstand anything. I'm getting in an elevator and going up to the very top floor. I think there were a lot of children in this building. maybe a class or maybe different classes with their teachers. They were there as part of their normal day. It seems that after I had gone to the top floor that I went to a lower floor. Maybe back up again. I don't remember it what order or why. There was some association to the daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless, the characters Jack and Phyllis. In the elevator of this building it seems that there was a problem. I don't know if I was in a relationship with Jack and someone was destroying a bunch of personal things of ours or mine, trying to separate us. There was a problem with the elevator so I was trying to climb out of the elevator and up through the shaft. It was like it was dangling. and dangling crooked, as though it didn't really fit in the shaft. The shaft was possibly a lot larger than the elevator. I was trying to climb out of the elevator onto the nearest floor above me. There was a handle inside the wall that I was trying to get my hand inside of and pull myself up. I was having a lot of trouble. I started calling for help. Someone did finally come and help me get onto that floor. In another scene I was with a bunch of people. I think we decided that we were in danger in this building so we were going to try to escape. There was one way out that someone had directed us to. Only a certain number of people got out that way safely. Then it became dangerous. So we started looking for another way. In one scene I was with a bunch of girls that were part of a band, like them and their boyfriends were part of a band. These men were asking them to do something. They didn't realize that the men were asking them to do this but at the same time they were being unfaithful. I tried to tell them and they didn't believe me. They finally decided to confront the men and ask them. The men admitted to it. So they had a little bit of a confrontation. Then the men changed their minds and decided to be faithful. I left them. When I left them they were singing one of their songs.  "
"0500"	"(2002-11-29)"	"Bill C hired Susan J. He gave her Haley N's office. He gave Haley N my office. He put me in his office. I don't remember where he went. I was very, very upset about this because he had not talked to me about it and I felt that it was a step down. I was feeling very angry."
"0501"	"(2002-12-01)"	"I was sharing an apartment with a woman named Sharon. She was getting ready to go out one evening. I was going to be staying in. She had been trying different outfits on. She tried on a suit, pants and a jacket. She asked me if it looked appropriate. I said it did. I told her it looked great. I thought she was going to meet a friend, I don't know if the friend was male or female. She leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek when she got ready to go. I thought it was odd but I kissed her cheek in return. After she left, I ordered a large pizza for dinner. I ordered a large so I would have leftovers for other meals. I took off most of my clothes because I was getting ready to do laundry. My pizza was delivered and I was ready to start my laundry. Sharon came home, very early. Her parents and her brother were with her. I was embarrassed because I didn't have many clothes on, because of the large pizza, and because I the apartment seemed a mess with my laundry out. I was grabbing up my clothes and said something about it all. Sharon was telling her family how wonderful she thought I was. I think I asked her if she was just saying that because my birthday was coming up on Wednesday. She said no. I don't remember what I said next but she said she was 61. I couldn't believe that she looked as good as she did at 61. I would never have guessed her to be more than mid 40's. It seems that there was something about romance between her brother and I. I don't know if she wanted to try to get us together, if he was interested in getting together with me, or vice versa. Just not sure."
"0502"	"(2002-12-07)"	"I was staying at Uncle J and Aunt A's house. [I'm not sure how to explain this but in recalling the dream it isn't until later that I realize why I am there.] I was staying overnight. I was sleeping in their basement. One part of it was a large open room and other parts of it seemed to be like separate small rooms yet not separated by four walls and a door. The big open area was packed with miscellaneous furniture. It was hard to find room to walk around it. There also seemed to be several beds down there. They had me sleep in a bed that was near the bottom of the steps, but in this big open area. Donald K was going to be spending the night also and he was going to be sleeping that bed so they had to put me someplace else. Sandy K and Carol K were there also. They were going to be sleeping in one of the more separate areas. They found another area for me to sleep. I was thinking about cleaning up/organizing that big open area. I didn't want to offend them. I just wanted to do it to be nice and helpful and I knew I could do it well. I didn't do it. I was thinking about the fact that I didn't know how they would feel about it. Bev was getting married. I was doing something and for some reason I realized I was running late for the wedding. There was a heated discussion about who was going to take a shower when and where. I think there were two separate shower/toilet areas. The toilet seemed to have three walls around it. only enough room for the toilet, and yet with no door. When I went to use it I had my long ivory sweater jacket with me and I hung it from something in front of me. I turned it to act as a curtain so no one could see in. There was someone standing out there and I told them, or asked them, to help hold it so no one would see in. The bathtub/showers had two walls and the shower curtains ran around the other two sides. There was some discussion about who was going to use the shower when. I agreed to wait until last. But, I was the maid of honor. Somehow I ended up running late. I looked at my watch and it was 11:45. I realized the wedding was going to start in one half-hour. I hadn't showered yet. I still had to shower, dress, and get to the church. I was very upset and panicked so I didn't even shower. I just grabbed my stuff and left. I don't remember who drove me. I think it was on the way there that I realized that there was something all over the left shoulder. It was covered in white candle wax. I was so angry with myself for not checking it earlier. I realized that I had worn it before I should have at least checked it, if not had it cleaned again. I was trying to crack and peel the dress off the dress. I didn't know if I could get it off. I didn't know how it would look. I realized at this point that I was late for the wedding and that they had postponed the start of the wedding because of me. I was so, so upset that I had done all this. Those things had not worked out better. I realized that part of it was my fault but I also felt that some of it had been out of my control. I knew that a lot of people were going to be very upset with me. I was very upset about that too. I was very upset about the whole thing."
"0503"	"(2002-12-07)"	"I was going shopping. I was Christmas shopping. I was looking for an electronic item for Matthew. I ran into Darren at the store. I invited him to walk with me and look too. He did. While we were looking in the display cases I found this game. It was like a maze in a plastic case. You had a magnetic thing that sat on top that you used to move a piece inside around the maze. like a steel ball. I think this was something to do with Batman. The magnet moved Batman through the maze. I asked Darren if he remembered those things from when we were younger. He said he did. I stood there a played with it for a minute and decided it was much too easy for Matthew. I had gone there to look for something very specific. Darren said he was going to go look at something else. I noticed these tall wide walls of jewelry. I decided to go look at it for myself. I knew I shouldn't be spending money on myself right now so I decided to just see if there was anything on clearance. I don't think I saw anything."
"0504"	"(2002-12-07)"	"I was in a museum. I was looking at a computer, typing something up about this museum, like a description. I was describing this one room that was about this one guy. There was something about his own music. I was retyping it to say that this organ was playing this man's music."
"0505"	"(2002-12-11)"	"Someone had used up all of the wet wipes. I was very irritated by this because I had only had it a couple of days and already they had emptied this. There were a lot of people in this house. I think most of the people were leaving. I think they were headed to GC. I decided to go with them. I was packing or whatever, planning to go with them. As I was doing so it occurred to me how long we would be gone. Maybe it meant we were going to be gone over the Holiday. I stopped packing and was rethinking my decision. I was trying to decide if I really wanted to do that. It might have had to do with the fact that I wasn't sure if I could take a week off work. I am thinking about going to a week long retreat in January and there is also a weeklong training in California that I'm thinking about attending. I probably can't take both weeks off. I've been debating about which one to attend."
"0506"	"(2002-12-12)"	"Something about the TV show ER."
"0507"	"(2002-12-21)"	"I was with Bill C. We were outside of the office someplace. We were talking business. He was worried or upset about something and was talking and talking. I finally took my hand and turned his face towards me. I leaned in as though I was going to kiss him and then pulled back. Then he leaned over and kissed me. It was just a couple of very light kisses. Then he pulled back and made some sort of facial expression to imply that he had really enjoyed the kiss. I think we were back at the office now. I don't know if he wanted another kiss or what but I was saying no that I couldn't do that because I work for him. He wouldn't just drop it."
"0508"	"(2002-12-22)"	"I had written letters to several of my old male friends. I wanted to reconnect with some or at least one of them that I could maintain a strong friendship with. I wanted the aspects of the opposite gender friendship, non-sexual though, that you don't get with a same gender friendship. So, I wanted to reconnect with one of these men. Tony S was the one I reconnected with. I think we were at his house sitting on the sofa talking. He said he wanted very much to reconnect and reestablish a strong friendship. But then he also told me that he had always loved me. I don't know how I felt about that. We ended up making love and I had very mixed feelings about this. Because his wife, Dorothy S, is my friend also. I had no desire to betray her. No desire to break up anyone's marriage. Yet, it felt very good to reconnect with Tony S. I suppose in waking life there was some attraction to Tony S though I can't imagine wanting to have a romantic relationship with him because we are too different. I think the attraction was simply that Tony S is just fun to be around. I was going to just leave and get out of the house before Dorothy S came home. In this scene Tony S wasn't there either. There was a male friend of theirs and some other men came in. They were going to be staying there. They were surprised to see me there. They didn't know me and I made some excuse as to why I was there and said I was just leaving. As I was walking out I say Dorothy S sitting on a step. She was holding something in her hand and was sobbing. I thought I was going to just sneak out without her seeing me. As I got out the door I heard her say goodbye to me. I was going to just ignore it and act as though I didn't hear it. Then I heard her yell it again. So, I called back and said goodbye to her. I think I had another conversation with Tony S, or maybe a conversation with Dorothy S. Maybe I assured her that I was only there because I wanted to reconnect with my old male friends to regain the perspective that I get from my male friends."
"0509"	"(2002-12-31)"	"I was on a bus. A man in one of the seats rose into the air as if levitating, and floated there on his back with knees bent. He had a jar of some kind of cream in his right hand. He raised his shirt, reached into the jar for some of the cream, and rubbed it on his stomach. As he did so he rolled over, face down now, and then up, in a seated position. He then floated gently back into his seat. He was wearing khaki shorts and a Hawaiian-type shirt."
"0510"	"(2003-01-11)"	"I was spending a week or so with a wealthy family member who owned and lived in a mansion. I was there to help them with some type of program. As part of this program we had invited in a bunch of women who were brides. maybe 50. They were invited to wear their wedding gowns for the entire seven days that they were there. Some of they did and some of them didn't. Later in the week I was riding down an escalator in the home with a bunch of them. I asked them how it felt to be able to wear their wedding gowns for a whole week and some of them loved it and some of them said they hated it. They said they were just sick of it. I kind of chuckled and said, Is that because of how uncomfortable it is, or maybe too heavy? I don't think anyone answered. There was another group approaching as we were getting off the escalator. Another group of brides was approaching to go up the escalator. Deena A was there. I was in a hurry and didn't have to stop. Just as I was walking past her I said hello. She was sitting with some other people. She was going through some papers. I said, Hi Deena A. How are you? I could tell by her response that she wasn't doing well, maybe upset or aggravated. I ran into Steve B. I think we walked together for a little while and chatting while we walked. Asking each other how we were doing etc. He was talking about how busy this week was and that it's very difficult to enjoy yourself during a time like this. I said, Yes, I guess I know. I haven't had time to spend with any of my old DDSI friends because I was so busy attending to these people. He said, Yes. I said, but that's not to say that I'm not enjoying myself. It's just that, like you, I wish I had time to spend with my old friends. He said, I'm in agreement. About that time I saw Deena A the second time and stopped to see what was going on with her. I took a minute to sit with her. I said, Okay Girlfriend. Tell me what's going on. She said something about me introducing myself under a different name. That wasn't why she was upset but she said that she noticed that and was curious about it. I don't remember her telling me why she was upset. I saw two of our visitors sitting together on a settee. I stopped long enough to say hello and ask how they were doing. It was morning and I wanted to make sure that they had gotten breakfast. One of them said she had just finished with her translator. I said, Okay. I just nodded and said, Okay and continued on my way. Some family member had at one point taken me into a formal dining room. We were going to have some additional guests in a day or two. We were going to be having a dinner or something in this room. Off of the back of this room there were doors at either end. single French doors that lead into a very small narrow room. Looked kind of like a foyer. They said this would be a room that people could go into to have a quieter place to chat. I think there was similar room at each end of the dining room as well, but they weren't as long as the one off the back. They also each were connected by a French door. I was thinking that each of those led to a restroom. I went in there two or three times to check on something. I was doing a preparatory check. I was talking to one of the other family members, maybe the female owner of the home, about the carpets needing to be cleaned. She agreed but we decided to wait until after the bridal program was over. At first we talked about just getting certain rooms done and then get the others done later. I decided to just wait and have them do it all at once. It had been quite awhile since all the carpets had been cleaned. Money certainly wasn't an issue. The bedroom where I was staying was part of a suite. I had the whole suite to myself. I had come out from watching TV and I heard someone else's TV playing. I walked around to see where it was or who was up. I saw where it was coming from but the door was closed so I decided not to bother them. Then I started wondering if I had my own TV turned up so loud that other people heard it. I didn't want to have done that."
"0511"	"(2003-01-12)"	"I was receiving some kind of award or recognition from the town I was living in for my efforts in trying to rid the town of bad men like the ones described in the rest of the dream. I was standing on a hardwood platform. It looked like a hardwood floor in a house. I was living in a small, rundown shack. I was peering out one of the two glass panels of the front door. The panels were one on top of the other. I was sitting on the floor, peering out the bottom panel, which was a square. The top panel was a rectangle. The whole area had the same type of small wooden shacks. I was looking across the street at some people sitting on the floor looking out the bottom square of theirs. There were three people looking out of that one. I kept looking at it and at one point it seemed that I was lucid so I kept asking myself, What am I doing here? What am I doing here? This car pulled up. I realized that my husband was home and was yelling. I knew that I needed to run away. I started to run. I was having trouble getting away so I started to fly. I couldn't fly fast and I couldn't get very high off the ground. I was just high enough that he couldn't reach me. He kept throwing a knife at me and fortunately he kept missing me. He kept trying to throw it different ways but kept missing me. I kept trying to get away. I had led them, he was with another man now, over a rut in the dirt. It was very muddy. They slipped and fell into it. It was a rattlesnake pit. They were getting bitten and I thought they were dying. They somehow managed to get out alive and continued to chase me. I had gotten myself back into one of these shacks. I felt as though I was moving in slow motion. I couldn't do anything quickly. I tried to go into one room and slam the door shut and lock it. But I couldn't move quickly at all. I had finally gotten one door shut. I still couldn't move fast enough to get it locked. It was as though I was moving in slow motion. I finally managed to get out. I came across a nun. I asked her what she was doing there and she said she was there to help me get away. She was directing me to do different things, but I still couldn't move fast at all. I was doing different things trying to trip them up and deter them but I couldn't believe that the snakes hadn't killed them. They were at least moving slower because of the snakebites. We were in one room and he was leaning with his back by this window. He didn't have a shirt on. I managed to pick up a piece of furniture and push it against him. I lifted it up and pushed him out the window. He fell headfirst into a lake. I thought he was sick enough from the snakebites that he wouldn't be able to survive. I thought he would drown. I did the same thing with the other man. I heard him say, sh. Just act as though we're drowning then we'll surprise her. I told the nun that they were pretending to drown. I continued to try to get away. I was lucid again at this point and said, I have got to wake up. I did."
"0512"	"(2003-01-17)"	"My flower gardens, but not the flowerbeds here. I don't know where I was initially. There was someone, maybe my Dad but not my waking life Dad. We were working together on planting some things. He was helping me. I remember thinking that if I worked with him on this on a yearly basis that eventually I would learn enough that I would be fine when he is gone. I would know what to do and things such as that. There were two green plants. I don't remember if they were flowering plants or not. He had planted them very close together. At first I thought it was very odd and then I realized it would be a very good look as they matured. It would be very pretty the way they were placed. He was putting something like a very dark rich dirt around them. He was piling it up kind of high around them. One of them had a little pink ball of fuzz sticking out of it. I noticed it and was going to go pull it out but I don't think I did. I was sleeping but needed to get up. There were a lot of people around. I was at a house that I had either just moved into or was going to be moving into. I had a sense that it was like our house on Lakeland Dr. Maybe it was that house but it didn't necessarily look like it. I was walking around looking at the flowerbeds and such. All of my roses were gone from the front flowerbed. The previous owners had extended the flowerbeds all across the front of the house and around the right side and back. In the front they had also extended them down along the side of the driveway. They had made this big rounded, odd shaped flowerbed. It resembled what I've seen on HGTV. I recall seeing Wisteria someplace. It may have been in one of my dreams. When I saw this Wisteria I thought it was very pretty and wanted to remember to put it on my list of things that I want to put in my flowerbeds this spring. I saw that they had lots of Wisteria there. I thought that was very cool. I noticed there was a theme to their flowers. Most of the flowers were yellow and lavender. There might have been some white. I was disappointed that my roses were gone. As I continued around the house I noticed they had many plant hangers in the trees. There were many more mature trees close to the house than there used to be. These plant hangers were very long. Some of them were large. Some were made of iron. They had a hook on one end that you could just hook them onto a branch of the tree. They other end was a hook to hang the plant on. Some were simple colors like brown, black, and white. They were very ornate. Some were very colorful. Some were shaped steel- kind of like a spiral. Some seemed to be carved wood. The more ornate colorful ones were wood. They were very shiny and smooth to the touch. They were bunches of them hanging in the trees. I went around and pulled them all out so I could have them all in one spot and then decide from there where I wanted each one. The previous owner had left them for us. Darren was there at one point. We went around the left side of the house. There was a tall redwood fence. It was the one we had built when we lived there and built the deck but it looked taller and different. It was only along the side of the house. Darren was washing it down. It was so tall that Darren had to stand on the tips of his toes to reach the top. He was washing it all off. I said I was surprised that they left that when they tore the deck off. I went around to the backyard. The pool was still there but it looked as though they had put it in ground. I said I was surprised that they had left that, especially when state law requires that there be a six-foot fence with a locking gate around any pool. I said that we needed to get rid of it. I think we might have had some discussion about the fact that it could be cleaned up and usable. I didn't want to because of safety, I didn't want to put a fence up and because it is a lot of work to maintain. I said that we need to get rid of it immediately. Darren went and got a piece of hose to start siphoning the water out. The piece of hose that he got was only about 3-4 feet long. He started siphoning but then he cared the hose to the back of the property so that no part of the hose was left in the pool. Yet it still seemed to be working. I asked him how that could possibly work. He said he didn't know how to explain but it just does. He said you just use the hose to start siphoning and then you pull the hose out. The water was still somehow being pulled out of the pool and through the hose, as if by magnetic force. After some of the water starting siphoning out I realized that I could grab the pool and just pull it out of the ground and pour the water out. When I did that I realized that it wasn't our pool at all. They had just buried a child's pool into the ground. I finished draining the pool and then took it around to Darren to show him what they had done. I saw our neighbor's outside. The female neighbor looked like a very young Connie B. I thought that to myself. I thought is that really Connie B at a very young age or does it just look like Connie B at a very young age. It looked like her husband Glenn B talking to her so I'm not sure what that was about. These people lived on the left side of us just as Connie B and Glenn B did in waking life. The neighbors from the other side came out. That house looked very different than the one in waking life and the people were different. They were talking about the limestone on the outside of their house and how much they loved it. Somehow, when you walk around that side of our house, it seemed that we had to step on some of their limestone. So going back and forth from the front yard to the backyard I was constantly stepping on this. They were just going on and on about how great this limestone was and how much they loved it. I noticed when we were getting ready to drain the pool that there was another house kind of behind these two yet set back. I don't know how that could work. It wasn't the case in waking life. Darren and I were joking about these people loving their limestone so much. Darren said something about the man even eating off of the limestone. I think the neighbor overheard part of it. He said, You don't like limestone? What's the matter with you? I had been taking a nap or laying down. I opened my eyes and looked up. I saw a bunch of flowerpots sitting on a ledge or shelf just outside the window. They were all flowering. I don't remember what colors now. Some of them were tulips. I thought, Oh. My tulips. I can go ahead and plant the tulips Ashley B gave me for Christmas. Those are blooming already. I better hurry up and get mine planted. So I got up and got mine out of the refrigerator to start planting them. I noticed that the other thing that she gave me was Wisteria. I thought, Oh that's cool. I was thinking about going to buy Wisteria and here that's what she gave me. I heard someone coming so for some reason I thought I needed to hide these. I don't know why. I quickly put them back in bags and was about to put them back in the refrigerator. I don't think whoever it was saw what I had so I don't think it was a problem."
"0513"	"(2003-01-21)"	"I met Bill C at a restaurant. We were having a focus group. There were three women who were joining us for this focus group. One was Cathy L. One I don't know now who it was. One we called Annie W but it was Debbie We. Kara C was there also. Bill C had gone and hung up his and Kara C's coats. When the women came in I took them to our tables. They were hanging their coats on the back of their chairs. We all had long coats on so they were dragging on the floor. I had to come up with a way to push a lot of it through the back of the seat so it wouldn't drag on the floor. Then I sat on it that way. I showed the other women my idea. Then I saw someplace to hang them so I took them and hung them up. In the meantime Bill C was waiting in line for something. When the three women came in I said hello to Cathy L and then to the other woman. Then I said hello to Annie W. She asked if she knew me and I said yes. You know me as Elizabeth H although I go by Anna now. She didn't say anything else. We had the meeting. We got up and got our coats to leave. There was also something about some reports or papers or something and we needed to edit it maybe. There was something that wasn't quite right and I think I was telling Bill C what we needed to do to correct it."
"0514"	"(2003-01-25)"	"I somehow was notified that Matthew was not going to be able to live with me nor see me for a period of probably six months or longer. I found out that BJ was responsible for this. She had learned that Darren was going to have to have heart bypass - 6 bypasses - surgery. She thought my feelings toward him were going to be harmful to him through Matthew. She felt that the surgery and his recovery would go much better if Matthew were living with him and having no contact with me. She convinced Darren's doctor of this and they did something to enforce this decision. I was absolutely livid. I think BJ, Bob F, F and I were at our birth home. I went and found BJ and I was having trouble speaking I was so angry. I kept asking, How could you do this? How could you do such a thing? She went into Mother and Daddy's bedroom. They were very upset. They were upset to see two of their children so torn apart. I decided that BJ would just have to no longer be a part of my life. ever. I just didn't think I could ever forgive her for this. Then I found out she had gone to Bob F and he supported her. Daddy was crying because he was so upset. I think he agreed with me but wanted to stay out of it. He didn't want to take sides. I think the same was true with Mother. I just remember seeing Matthew at a distance with Darren. Darren seemed unsure about the decision. as though he was glad for it yet realized it was not the right thing. You could tell Matthew didn't want it. but also didn't to do anything to endanger his Daddy's life. He looked very, very sad. I finally went to the doctor and begged him for a chance to talk to him privately. He agreed. I told him a little bit about BJ. How long she was married, what happened in their marriage. both to her and to her children. I asked him if he still trusted her judgement. He agreed that he had made the wrong decision and assured me he would get it overturned. He, my family, Darren, and Matthew were there, but I don't know where there was, when I found out that the decision had been overturned. Matthew ran up to me and hugged me for minutes. We were both talking in a high-pitched voice and crying because we were so excited."
"0515"	"(2003-01-27)"	"I was in a beauty pageant. I realized that I was the oldest woman in the pageant. When I realized this I was going to drop out. The people I was with wanted me to stay in for precisely that reason. They wanted me to show how great a 40+ woman can be."
"0516"	"(2003-01-27)"	"I was at the CAS offices, though they looked different than in waking life. There were several offices. I was sharing an office with Bill C. There was a salesperson name Mike [unknown] that was leaving our employment. He decided that it had been too long since he sold anything and decided it was time for him to move on. He was in his office. He had lots of boxes and was putting his personal belongings in them. I was wondering why Bill C had not told me that Mike was leaving. There were two offices or rooms that were full of extra furniture. Some of it was quite nice. Some of it was quite old, like the old green and gray metal desks. I was looking around thinking that now that Mike was leaving we could each have our own office. I wanted my own office, and yet I realized that working in the same office as Bill C was nice because I could ask him questions quite easily. I can ask him things as they come to mind as opposed to creating a list or having a pile of stuff for him. I was debating if that was what I really wanted to do, yet it somehow felt as though I didn't really have a choice. That is what we were really going to do. I was in one of these rooms with all this furniture in it. I was moving things around. I was debating about switching my furniture to something nicer that I saw in one of these rooms. There was something about Haley N and me sharing an office now. Of course, I did NOT want that. I think that's when I had the idea that we had the space now for each member of the staff to have their own office. Yet, still that it was convenient for me to share an office with Bill C. I was also thinking about the fact that we had all this extra furniture there. It was probably stuff that we would never use. It was just taking up space and it was just messy-filling up both rooms the way it was. There was no rhyme or reason to the way that it was in the rooms. It looked as though someone had just arrived it in and sat it anywhere. It was all sitting at different angles and such. I started moving some things around and I was going to try to organize the rooms a little bit. There were all kinds of different pieces, like different types of desks and different types of bookshelves. While I was moving this stuff around I also came upon these things that were shaped like hearts. They were probably about 3 ft x 3 ft. I'm not sure what they were made out of. I don't think they were all made out of the same thing. There were a bunch of them that seemed to be made out of Mylar - silver Mylar. I was trying to gather them up and put them in a nice neat pile. Bill C's wife came in. She was talking about all of this furniture. Then Bill C came in and was helping. He started moving things around. It was very easy for him - as though the furniture weighed ounces rather than pounds. He would pick up two or three pieces at a time and move it. He was stacking it, back to back along the wall-one or two walls."
"0517"	"(2003-01-27)"	"Matthew had either called or came home and was upset. He was telling me that Ashley B had decided to break up with him. I wanted to make sure that I said the right thing or didn't say the wrong thing. That was most important. I wanted to be comforting and I didn't want to say anything that would alienate him and keep him from coming to me in the future and talking openly. I was thinking to myself that it was for the best that she made that decision."
"0518"	"(2003-01-28)"	"BJ was spending the night with me. I was in bed already and asleep. She had gone out for the evening and I heard her come in, lock, and chain the door. I thought that I should have given her the passcode but then didn't think anymore of it. I heard her in the office, as though she was getting ready for bed. I thought that I should get up and help her get the bed down, get her bed ready. There was a futon in there and I wasn't sure she would know how to lay the futon down. I wanted her to be comfortable so I was going to go in and lay it down for her. I called for her from bed but I don't think she heard me. So I got up and as I headed towards the office I called for her again once or twice and didn't hear a response. I said I'm calling because I don't want to frighten you. I couldn't see very well so I went back into my bedroom and got my flashlight and went back in. Then I realized she wasn't in there. She must have gone downstairs. I started straightening the office, moving some papers around and reorganizing some binders and such to make more room for her. She had laid her watch and something else on the floor so I picked them up and set them on a table where I had just made room. Just as I was about ready to lay the futon down I realized that I should just have her sleep in Matthew's room. That bed is ready and she would be more comfortable in there anyway. I was going to tell her that and I heard her downstairs talking to someone. It seems that it was someone who works for me and is always there at night. I heard that woman say that it was nice to have someone there at that time of night - someone to talk to. She was just being very friendly. She was a very large black woman."
"0519"	"(2003-01-28)"	"I died and was being lifted by some unseen power to heaven. Well, maybe to heaven. I'm not sure. I don't think I was afraid. As I was being lifted, I could see the world beneath me. I could see city lights and things. I had my hands folded in front of me. My biggest concern was Matthew and how difficult my death would be for him. I was thinking that at least I am headed in the right direction. I'm headed up and not down. There were several times that I prayed while I was being pulled up. It seemed to take along time to be lifted all the way up. While I was being lifted, I prayed several times, that God would comfort Matthew. I just kept asking God to help Matthew through this. I was now in a small room. All four walls were glass. It was a square room. There was room for little more than two people to sit, face-to-face. I was sitting there in a chair. I don't really know how I got in there. Jesus came in and went back out to find another folding chair. Then he came back in and sat with me. He was holding my hands. I asked him to be with Matthew. He said that they had arranged for him to spend time with Grandpa Fr. They were going to an amusement park. We sat there and talked. He kept holding my hands. I just kept saying, repeatedly, how sorry I was that I had so much difficulty being tolerant and forgiving of some people. I told him how much I disliked that about myself and how much I wish I could have done better, how hard it was, how sorry I was. Then I realized that I was going to be sent back - that I wouldn't remember any of it. I kept wondering if I could will myself to remember any of it. I didn't think that would be the case. I wondered if Matthew would remember what happened afterwards."
"0520"	"(2003-01-29)"	"I was with Bill F, Brian F, Bob F, Daddy, and Matthew. Matthew was only 9 or 10 years old. We went someplace to eat, like a Hardee's. Right inside the door were platters of food on each side of the door. We were to choose what we wanted from these trays. It seemed that they were sitting on top of the trashcans that you typically find in this type of restaurant. We each got a plate and started choosing what we wanted. Matthew and one of the others would take a fork and take something off the platter and put it straight in their mouth. I told them to quit doing that because it was very bad manners. I told them that they need to put it on their plates and then eat it when we get to the table. We went to find a table. We found two tables that we could push together so we could eat. We had stopped so Matthew could use the bathroom, but now he had to go again. He and I both decided to leave and go find a bathroom. Daddy was upset that we were going to be gone so long because it was going to take us 2 hours. I told one of the others that this was perfectly reasonable, that we couldn't do it in less time. We went ahead and left. Now we were helping Matthew move into his dorm. It didn't look like his waking life dorm. That didn't take very long at all."
"0521"	"(2003-01-31)"	"Uncle A was there. I went and talked to him a couple of times. Towards the end I am with a group of women - maybe from CIIS, my cohort, but Susan J was there. We went to the dining room to have dinner. They are serving a spaghetti dinner. We have a platter of spaghetti and meatballs that we took from the main serving area to our table. I saw some other people were taking time to pray before their meal. We were waiting for some woman to finish taking her spaghetti off the platter. Susan J and I were talking about the fact that we always use the large plastic tongs, like they had here, at home because it makes serving spaghetti so much easier. The woman we were waiting for wasn't using them. When I took my turn I took all that was left. There 8 or 9 fairly large meatballs and quite a bit of spaghetti. As soon as I did it I realized that I shouldn't have done that because it was supposed to be shared by our table. I was very embarrassed but I didn't know what to do to make it right. We were now in another room. We were wearing roller blades. We were playing some form of indoor hockey. Instead of a puck we had a red plastic ball about the size of a grapefruit. It had holes that looked similar to the holes in a bowling ball but they had a bottom in them. They were the size of the holes in a bowling ball. You couldn't put your fingers in them. They were maybe an inch deep. I don't know if we were playing a game. We weren't doing very well. I think there was a man there that came up and told us that we should really be moving back and forth down the floor with the ball. I said that I can't skate that fast and with that being a ball I can't keep up with it to chase it down the floor. The others, I think, kind of agreed. Then I suggested that maybe we just need to keep our team members spread out far enough that no one of us has to keep up with the ball but rather just intercept and pass it on. There were two or three women who were just kind or practicing. They were spread out the way I had just suggested to our team. They made a goal. So my team realized then that it was a good idea and that we could do this."
"0522"	"(2003-02-01)"	"I was in a car with the President of the United States. It was someone other than George W. Bush. We were being shot at. I was now in my home. The same townhouse where I live in waking life. I was going outside but forgot to turn my alarm off, or I didn't turn it off on purpose before going outside. I stepped outside and heard what the alarm sounds like from the outside when it goes off. I thought, oh, that's what it sounds like from out here. I went back inside and turned it off. The police and Tim U, the maintenance man, showed up wanting to know what was wrong. I tried to reassure them nothing was wrong. I had to show them proof of who I was. A family that I didn't know pulled up in their car and at first they were just sitting out there. I wondered why they were there. The man got out of the car and the woman was sitting in the passenger side of the front seat. I noticed she was sobbing. The man came up to the police and me and tried to tell the police that I had hurt the woman's father. I don't know if she was claiming that I shot and/or killed him? I told them that I didn't. I think Rachel I from SDI was there now. She backed me up in assuring the police that I didn't even know the woman's father. I am inside now but it is now an apartment building. I seem to be an observer rather than participant now also. Two people from the TV show ER lived there. It was John Carter and Abby. There were also two couples who lived in our building that we knew. Both partners of both couples were obese. Them, Abby, and John were going to go use the hot tubs together. The couples, or at least some of those four people, had arrived at the hot tubs as had Abby. Someone came in and hurt Abby and put her head underwater. I knew she wasn't dead but I knew that John needed to show up quickly to save her. One of the couples might have been the couple that had accused me of hurting her father. It seems that maybe they thought Abby supported my innocence so they were taking their anger out, in retaliation, on her."
"0523"	"(2003-02-04)"	"I was at the CAS office. They were on a boat. The wood slats of the boat had gaps, at least the ones higher than water level had gaps between. The gaps were about what you would see in a fence. So I could see between them. Bill C's office was set behind and above Haley N's and mine. Ours were side by side. I had overslept so I got to work late. My hair was very wet and I wasn't dressed. I just had a towel wrapped around me. I was trying to move around very gingerly so I wouldn't drop my towel and so Bill C wouldn't see anything. Haley N had left. I was reaching into something to try to get the key to my office. I did that. There was something, maybe a bathroom stall, in between my office and Bill C's office. I slipped in there to get dressed. There were actually two of them. I used the one to the right because I was afraid if I used the one to the left Bill C would see me getting dressed. I went into his office. He had Valentine decorations up. I was thinking about the fact that he is very good about seasonal decorations put up on a very timely manner. Then I realized it was Jane C that does that. I heard a radio ad playing. I don't remember what it was for. But when I went to the offices on the boat, I went into Haley N's office for something and she had left her radio playing. The same ad was playing. I was wondering if Bill C had heard that ad. It had something to do with us but I don't know if it was one of our ads or a client that had used our services. I actually think it was someone who had hired me to do a dream lecture, but maybe it also had something to do with CAS. I don't know. When I heard it I thought, oh, they haven't called me in awhile. They haven't hired me in a while. There was something about my relationship with Haley N and it being too late for me to make it better. Bill C was kind of fed up. He asked me to say something into a recorder. He said he was so sick of hearing voices - that he had interviewed so many people. I said, interviewed so many people? I don't understand. Why? He said, Because I have to get ready to fire you. I started begging him not to. He started going over results since I had been there. He was pointing out that I hadn't gotten any results. He said my performance was just okay. I said, Well I don't disagree that I haven't gotten results. I don't think it is due to my lack of effort or ability. I have tried everything that I know to try. I have asked you what to do differently. So, I really don't think it is fair that you would let me go because of that. What I didn't point out to him that his on-going change of direction, inability to focus and stay focused on one goal, or reluctance to make decisions were the primary factors that prevented the company from growing last year. I was getting very upset and beginning to cry. He was getting upset and teary. I was just begging him not to let me go."
"0524"	"(2003-02-04)"	"I had gone to this place. I don't know how I got there or why I went there. It was packed with people. They were dancing. I realized that it was also, a Laundromat. It was a huge room and it was filled with single people who were there to socialize with other singles while doing their laundry. Once a week they have an event there, well maybe it wasn't all singles. People would go there to socialize and do their laundry at the same time. I felt uncomfortable being there because I didn't know anyone. I found a table and sat down. I glanced over and saw this man sitting there looking at me. He had on a baseball hat. He was a little rough looking. I averted my eyes but saw out of the corner of my eyes that he had gotten up and was coming over to me. He grabbed another empty chair and pulled it up and sat down across from me. He asked if it was okay if he sat and talked with me. We talked very briefly. I felt very uncomfortable. Fortunately, shortly after he sat down the music ended and it was time to go home. As I was getting ready to leave I saw Margie D and Dennis D there. Dennis D had lost alot of weight. I said something to him about it, about how good he looked. He noticed that I had lost weight also. I said, Thanks, but I have a feeling that you have lost alot more than I have. Not that you had more to lose. I realized that sounded bad and I was embarrassed. He said, No, I did lose quite a bit. I don't know if he told me how much he lost. He had to have lost alot, well over 75 pounds. I think they were involved in hosting this event. I was helping them clean up and such. While I was doing that I was picking at the snacks. I think it was Doritos. I picked up some bags that I was going to help them put away. As we were walking out to our cars I realized I still had the bags of snacks in my arms. I felt really bad. I was embarrassed. I didn't know what to do. I just decided to put them in my car and bring them with me when I come back the next time. Now I am at home, on Lakeland Dr. I'm talking to Margie D and Dennis D. I said that it is very unusual that now that we live on the same street like we had planned, we hardly ever see each other. There was a stairwell. I was going down the steps and I realized that I had gone down one or two flights to far. I saw through the door window that it was at street level. But I realized that it was a different street level than our houses are. So I went back up to go out. We're back at this laundromat the next week. There aren't many people there yet. Dennis D Jr. walked up to me. He had on a winter coat. I said, Now isn't that something? He hardly knows me. He has only seen me once or twice before. But he comes up to me as though I'm an old friend. Margie D just smiled and said, Yeah, he's like that. I was helping them get ready. There was a stepladder. We were hanging things. I decided to go ahead and get my laundry started. I put my bed linens in the washer. Then the place started filling up with people. There wasn't any music yet. I wondered when the music would start. I thought it was curious that people weren't bringing their children. I didn't find it odd that Margie D and Dennis D did. As the place started filling up with people, some women had put their things on top of the washer I was using. I had forgotten about them until I saw that. I decided that I should go check on my laundry. I told them that I needed to switch my laundry. They were helping me to take the bed linens out but they were really wet, as though they had not even spun-dry. I didn't think alot about it. I just decided it would take them longer in the dryer. But before I put them in the dryer I was putting the next load in the washer. It was a load of dress clothes. After I closed the washer I realized that I had put the sheets back in there also. I had leaned over to start the washer and realized that the sheets hadn't washed at all. The washer had stopped after it filled with water. I didn't wash them together because I had just dyed the sheets and I didn't want the dye to ruin my dress clothes. I opened the washer back up and was digging the sheets out. Margie D came over and I explained to her what happened. She was helping me dig my sheets back out. The other women gave me a dirty look and I explained to them what happened but I didn't know what. Then they eased the way they looked at me."

"0526"	"(2003-02-06)"	"Some members of my family were here in the city where I live. We were somewhere downtown at a convention facility, maybe a hotel with large meeting rooms. There was something about refreshments sitting outside the meeting rooms. Later there was a discussion about CIC and I told them that if I had known they had never been there I would have taken them. Later, We were helping someone move. I asked Bob F how it is that it seems that every year we are helping someone in the family move. He said that last year it was me. I didn't say anything but mentally I was questioning that because I didn't think I had moved last year. There didn't seem to be a lot of things that we were moving and I don't know who it was that we were helping to move. Someone brought in a small red duffel bag. Mother rushed over to it, opened it up and pulled out a red zippered sweatshirt and put it on. I said, Oh, Mother is happy now. She's been waiting to get her sweatshirt back. I was now doing some kind of housework type thing in one of my bathrooms. There were brown spots all over the shower tiles. I realized that I really needed to make time to clean the house good. I think I said that to someone. Brian F brought me a very large greeting card. I opened it up. It said something to my Godmother. As I read it, I realized that it was a Christmas card written for a Mom, but that Brian F had changed it to Godmother and written in phrases of his own in between what was already printed. I didn't say anything about what I noticed. I just smiled and let him know that I appreciated it. He took it back and then came back a minute later. He had formed it into the shape of a Christmas tree and had placed it around a roll of toilet paper to give it stability to sit on a coffee table. I found that he had taped it to the roll of toilet paper when I picked it up to look at it. Now it had been turned inside out, but still in the same shape. However, now it looked like something for Valentine's Day. It had pink and red things all over it. Maybe hearts and cupid and such. I turned it back around the other way and set it back down on the table. Then I was in my car with someone and we went to the car wash at 65th St. and B1 Blvd. I wasn't sure if it would be open. I was concerned that there would be a very long line of cars there because the weather had just warmed up enough for people to get their cars washed. There was a long line but I was feeling patient so decided to just wait. A woman was driving away, towards us. She was in an older red car - kind of a sporty looking car - something that a teenager might have driven in the 50's or 60's. The car seemed to still have a lot of soap on it. She rolled down her window and was complaining because they didn't have anymore hot water. I thought this seemed reasonable given the number of cars that were going through the wash today. She was a bit upset about it. Someone else, outside both of our cars, was involved in the conversation as well but I don't remember who it was or what they were saying. I was still going to get in line and wait. I thought whatever the car wash would be better than nothing at all. Father Eric was telling us about some big ceremony that he was officiating at church and that he had to leave for that event. I decided to go as well. As Father Eric stood at the front of the aisle facing the people I was sitting behind him and to his left. The church was packed with people. Bill C and his wife got out of a pew, came up to stand next to Father Eric and to his right. Then I saw Terry D and his wife, Ann D, get up and stand to Father Eric's left, but then they moved over to his right. I think they stood in front of Bill C and Jane C. There seemed to be 3-4 children who also got up and stood in front of Terry D and Ann D, as well as some other people who got up at that point. I was surprised to see Bill C and Jane C in a Catholic Church. I was thinking to myself that I didn't know they were Catholic. I wasn't so surprised by Terry and Ann D because I had wondered if they were Catholic. Father Eric led a procession around the church. I am now sitting to one side of the church, maybe not, maybe a reception area now. I am facing the front. The areas are not all clearly visible as there are lots of plants and things sitting around that seem to offer privacy to some seating areas. I was sitting there with Bill C and Jane C, Bill C's Dad and some other member's of Bill C's family. At first I think the ceremony involves Bill C but later I think it was celebrating Bill C and Jane C's 25th wedding anniversary. There is an odd shaped table between Bill C and myself. I am too his left. The base is like a rectangular box, about the height of a coffee table. The top, however, is shaped like a roof. It is the same color as my living room tables. Jane C is sitting to the right of Bill C and his family members are facing us. I got up to move and had to move carefully because the top lifted a bit off the table when I tried to move my chair. I moved my chair away from the table first and then I moved to a different seat, where Bill C was at angle behind and to my right. We were now eating something - maybe cake. Someone said something to me about doing or not doing something for Bill C. I said, I would likely do it because I do work for him. They were teasing me mostly, and I felt a bit unsure how to respond. I usually do things for Bill C without question, or without much question unless it is something I am strongly opposed to. I do not think I would do something that I felt was morally wrong, though I can't imagine him asking me to do something like that. This was a minor little thing. It almost seems that I brought him a piece of cake but someone else thought he shouldn't have it and that's what this was about. Bill C was just smiling about the whole thing. I was then walking out with someone behind me. I'm thinking it might have been Father Eric or Bill C. Now we were at a hospital. I saw Doctor C. At first I just said hello, but then walked up to him and opened my arms, keeping my elbows at my side and pointing my arms straight out in front of me to give a not so obvious indication that I wanted a hug, the way I often do with Matthew. He gave me a lukewarm hug, not like he normally would, because I was with someone - Father Eric or Bill C. After we hugged I realized they might have thought it was odd or inappropriate. As we were walking away I explained that I used to work for Doctor C and we had become very close work buddies. There was nothing more to it than that. We still talk occasionally and sometimes I stop to see him at the Sleep Center. It seems that I may have looked into his office and saw him working as I walked away."
"0527"	"(2003-02-07)"	"There were two men. I had to choose one of them to have a relationship with. I chose John Carter, from the TV program ER. I told someone that it was really no contest at all. The other man didn't begin to compare."
"0528"	"(2003-02-07)"	"I was with Darren. We were married. I had gone to see an apartment but I don't remember the reason. I was telling Darren about it and he insisted we go look at one for us. I agreed to go along. They were really incredible looking apartments. They were maybe three stories. Contemporary yet with a classic elegance. One room was a media room. This one room appeared to be two stories high. It was all white. One of the tall white walls was to be used for projection. I knew that even if we could figure out a way to afford the rent we could not afford to furnish it properly. I said this to Darren, I believe more than once. I was also thinking to myself that I didn't know if it was right to commit to an apartment like this when I wasn't sure that our marriage would work out."
"0529"	"(2003-02-07)"	"I think I must have been living in St. Joe, with Mother and Daddy. I had just spent some time with some of the men from high school. I know Dwight W and Albert S were there. Dwight W was coming on to me and I said something about him coming on to some many different women. He wanted me to believe that his interest was sincere. I knew better. They were getting together the next day for something. They found out that I had a delivery pizza business and ordered six pizzas from me for the next day. The next day I was busy making this pizza. Some of them started out as balls of dough that I shaped and prepared. Others looked like mini-pizzas, of various sizes, that I had to slowly move around the edges to stretch out. They had already been baked but were not brown around the edges. I would get one the right size and put it in the oven for just a few minutes until the edges browned, while I worked on the next one. I kept stacking them one on top of the other and repeating this process. I was concerned that the ones on the bottom might get to brown or become overdone but then decided that was not the case. As soon as they were finished I wanted to hurry to get them delivered while they were still hot. Someone, I think Matthew, was helping me to get everything to my car. One of the things we were taking to the car was a white ice cube holder. We had put something in it. One of the things was a glass of Diet Sprite for me. It didn't have a lid and I wanted to be careful not to spill it. When I got ready to leave I was having some difficulty with the car. It was either not stopping, not steering properly. I put it in reverse to try to fix the problem and the car sped backwards toward the garage. Mother was having a garage sale. She looked up but didn't realize what was going on and that I nearly crashed into the garage/sale. There was a child sitting in a highchair that recognized what had happened and looked at me like boy you were lucky! I put the car in forward and left. It seemed to be driving fine now. I wondered if I would remember the directions to where I was going. I arrived at a dirt lane. I found A's house and told him I had the pizza. He told me someone should have called and told me that they had cancelled the order. I was thinking about the payment and somehow realized or found out that they had prepaid and now wanted their money back because they had called to cancel. I think I may have gone somewhere else because now I was talking to Andy and he said he had paid me cash. I don't remember giving him his money back. I went back home and was looking through my phone order book. I was quite upset to learn that over the last week or so quite a few people had called in orders for pizza, all orders for one pizza, and I had not known about them and consequently not filled the orders. I was thinking about how bad this was for my business reputation. These people would be hesitant to order from me again. I was looking at the names of the people in the house who had taken the orders. I wanted to blame them for not telling me but realized that I only had myself to blame for not checking the order book and checking with other people on a regular basis. However, I also thought that, being a new business, it would have been considerate for them to point out to me that they had taken these orders until the business achieved a more regular rhythm. Otherwise, I would have to check the order book every few minutes to see if I had missed a call - so I could fill it on a timely basis. The people in St. Joe liked that there was now a pizza delivery place but I could lose the business quickly if they decided that I was unreliable."

They managed to get the area rug so it was covering them up and then they began mating. [Date of dream unknown] ."
"0532"	"(2003-02-10)"	"I was part of a Spanish family. It was important that the women in the family did exactly what the men asked of them. If a woman did not, they could decide to have her killed. I decided that this was no longer an acceptable way to live so I was going to leave. I wanted my husband to come with me but he refused. He did not want me to leave, but felt his first loyalty was to the larger family. The family found out what I was planning so they decided to have me killed. I knew that I would now have to sneak away, so I could escape before they killed me, and so they would not know where I went and be able to come and find me. I had gotten into a white convertible with a female friend of mine. Trying to get in the front seat was difficult as it was not like most cars. There was just a small space for your legs, which had your legs lying straight out in front of you. I had to lift up a small flap of rubber and put my legs in and try to fit them in. I was thinking how I uncomfortable it was. It was somehow related to this, or at this time, that I decided that I should leave the family. I was packing my things in a large piece of furniture on rollers. As I was packing my husband came up and was going to help me get away safely. I asked him to come with me but he said he couldn't. After I was packed we were rolling the furniture to a place that looked like a furniture store. There was more than one store but I recall thinking that one in particular would work well because my furniture would blend in better than in the other store. Having made that decision I asked my husband to come with me, but he said he couldn't. I knew he did not want to be separated from me, yet he could not leave the family. He turned and began to walk away. I called to him several times, begging him not to go. I was saying was pleading with him, please come back. I repeated this several times. At one point he did stop walking, turned around, and looked at me. I could tell he was very sad. But he turned and continued walking away."
"0533"	"(2003-02-11)"	"Regan K invited me to come to the UM to teach one single class/one single session, on dreams. I was really excited to do this through most of the dream. Regan K was actually Ben D. I went to the UM and taught class. I was very anxious about it going well, about doing well. At the end of the class I was asking someone to tell me when the class was over. Someone from the school had come in, maybe to make some announcements. I told them they had ten more minutes to study and then I would give them a 30-minute test. Then we would have 5 minutes of announcements. When they finished their tests I told them they could leave it on their desks and I would come around and pick them up after everyone left. Some people left their test lying under their coat, or in their coat, or on their coat, or had it sitting with their coat. They had all left and left their coats. I went around and picked up the tests. I was packing up and Ben D came in. I told him that I was a little anxious about how it went, especially being that it was his class. I care what he thinks. He walked me out and held out his arms to give me a hug, and then we kissed each other on the cheek. I walked away and started to my car. I thought, oh, that wasn't Ben D at all. That was Regan K. I was thinking about the fact that he had reached out his arms to hug me and that we kissed each other on the cheek. I thought that was nice. I was disappointed that he morphed into Regan K. I was on my way back to the office I think. This one road was very narrow. It was covered with snow and there was a high bank on either side. The weather was very bad. It was snow and ice. Cars were coming and I could see that there was only room for one car. I pulled over as much as possible and stop to allow the other cars to pass. I saw this other car coming up behind me. I wondered if they would slow down and pull over as well. I was concerned that they would hit me because they seemed to be driving too fast for the road conditions and they didn't seem to be slowing down. At first they stopped and then they started around me, into this other section of the road. Then they saw why I had pulled over so they backed up and pulled off. Twice they did this. Finally they let me go first. I got to a place where there was something like an avalanche. The snow had fallen down in and had just completely blocked the road. Now I wasn't in a car. The snow had completely enveloped me from the waist down. This other car was buried and I was very concerned about them. Part of me said something to insinuate that this is what they get for their bad driving. I was pushing on the one bank in front of me to use it as leverage to pull myself out. Then I got far enough that I could grab a small tree branch. As I was doing this I realized that the woman in the car behind was able to get out of the car part of the way so she was only waist high in the snow. She had her cell phone and was calling for help. In the meantime I was pulling myself out and headed to the office. I went back and Bruce U, the maintenance man, was working. At one place some other maintenance men were working. I had to get down and kind of get down on my stomach and shimmy through this hole in the wall to get into this one part of the building. Then I came to another place that was the same way. Bruce U was working. I didn't want to have to do that again. I asked Bruce U if I could just get in that way. He said yes and moved something so I could just walk in. I think some of my family was there. Daddy was there and Uncle H. I think Larry K and some others. We had talked about something but I don't remember what. I walked away and then I came back. I asked someone how far the UM is from here. Even though I had just driven it I didn't know how far it was. I thought that maybe it was just an hour. Uncle H and someone else seemed to agree that it was four hours. I said, Well, I thought maybe Mother and Daddy could go to this graduation. They couldn't go to the first two. I thought that maybe they could go to one out of three. But I guess not. Then I thought, It just isn't that important anyway. Because I was going to be there teaching for four hours, Ben D enrolled me in some kind of teachers association. After I finished teaching he told me this and I found out also that I was going to get paid. I was very excited about both of these things. He said something about the fact that all teachers belong to this association."

It was in the poorest part of town. They were living in a little shanty, with no windows. It was a mess, with stuff everywhere. They were looking a little rough also. I hesitated to go any further because I didn't want them to be embarrassed. On the other hand, I didn't want them to think it was a big deal to me either. They seemed to welcome me easy enough. Twice while I was there I had to use the bathroom. Then it seemed as though all these little shanties shared a bathroom that had maybe three or four stalls. The stalls didn't have walls. It was all open. I just made sure I locked the door when I went in. I don't remember why I was there. I saw Steve B and Valerie B come in. I was talking a little to Valerie B. I said that this must be very difficult for her. She said that it was and that it made her fairly angry that they had done this to her business. Someone said something about the way they were living now and my coming there. I said that it doesn't really bother me at all. I told them that I have a sister that lives in a situation somewhat similar to this. I said the only thing that bothers me is that I am concerned that the person who lives here might feel uncomfortable to have me come here, that they might be embarrassed."

"0539"	"(2003-02-14)"	"I was with Matthew at PLU. We were driving around campus. There were street flags hanging on every block, maybe 2 or 3 on each block. Each flag was advertising 4-6 things on campus. The flags were green and had two different colors of lettering. Some of the words were in a brighter color than the others. I think there was someone else in the car with us. I asked how students would know something, though I don't remember what, about the difference in the words on the flags. They said by the brighter color. Now I was with Matthew in a store on campus. He was going to be putting up one of the Christmas trees on campus. He had a tree, some silver garland, and some grapefruit-sized orange ornaments in a shopping cart. I didn't want to say much because I knew he probably wanted to make the decisions about how to do the tree but I also wanted him to think through what he needed. I asked him if he was going to put garland on the tree, even though I saw it in the cart. It didn't look to me like he had enough. When I asked he lifted up the garland from the cart and I saw he had plenty. Then I asked him if he was going to do the whole tree in orange ornaments. Again he lifted some things from the cart but this time he saw that he didn't have enough ornaments. We went down another aisle and found maybe two more groups of orange ornaments. The one group he was looking at actually looked like oranges. They appeared to have a long, 5-6 inch stem on them that was a hook shape on the end that you would use to hang them on the tree. Matthew picked one of them up and was looking at it. We realized that they actually had orange juice in them. I said that was a cool idea since there were so many viruses going around, they would be pretty on the tree plus they would serve the students well."
"0540"	"(2003-02-14)"	"I had gone back to visit the home of my grandparents. Several of my childhood friends were there. We were in the backyard and we were talking about these sticks that we used to find in the yard and play with. I said something about one of them having a vanilla like substance in it. I was still curious what that substance was and I was still curious to actually squeeze some out and taste it to see if it really tasted like vanilla. A couple people went to the far back section of the yard to collect a couple of these sticks. Now, the sticks were very large wood poles, almost like telephone poles but not as tall. They were standing vertically, leaning against something. The people who had gone to collect some knocked most of them down and emerged from behind them. They were ducking and laughing. They returned to where the rest of us were still sitting in the grass. Now the sticks were small branches as they were when we were children. Someone broke one of the sticks and squeezed something out of it. There was popcorn lying in the grass so they squeezed whatever it was all over the popcorn. It came out like clear syrup - almost like corn syrup. But it turned a light brown, almost caramel color, as it coated the popcorn. We all bravely agreed to taste it. Someone else, older than us, walked up and said something about our curiosity finally having us do this. We mostly just smiled as we tasted the now coated popcorn. He said, see, it tastes like caramel doesn't it? We agreed that it did. I still wanted to find the ones with the vanilla like substance. I found one and began to squeeze the substance out. It was white and creamy. I only squeezed a little bit out, touched it with my finger, and tasted it. It did taste like vanilla. Now we were at a building on the property that housed this huge old clock. The clock could only be seen from the inside though. When I opened the door there were 5 or 6 large wood pieces hanging from the ceiling. The building was only big enough for these. It was not a building you could walk into. Each wood piece was very tall, about 18 inches deep and maybe 6 inches wide. They had been constructed into a box shape with four pieces of wood. The one farthest to my left had a clock face on the left of its two widest surfaces. We were being told about the mystery of this clock. It apparently had something to do with me and if anything were ever to happen to me, something would happen to this clock, or vice versa. Later, I could see that the clock face was gone, but I don't think I was actually present. It seems more like I'm watching a movie at this point. I think I am now a child and I'm in a carriage, of sorts, with some other people and they are rushing me to the clockhouse. They are going to open the wood piece housing the clock and stand me inside. The purpose is either to save the clock or me. It feels that it is both. If I become sick or something happens to me, then something also happens to the clock. By putting me in the clock house I am restored to well being and the beautiful clock face returns as well. Now I am with a man, maybe my husband. We are in a restaurant. He is holding some kind of a trophy while singing and dancing. I was little embarrassed and several of us were kind of laughing about his actions. We were enjoying this aspect of his personality, at the same time we did want him to sit down. We left the restaurant but I don't know where we were going. The man is riding on the outside of a vehicle. Again this is like a scene from a movie. The vehicle he is on is trying to catch up to a larger vehicle and he is going to try to jump from on to the other. There seems to be an urgent purpose in this whole scenario. Just as they catch up to the larger vehicle and he prepares to jump he transforms into a small boy. He seems to be going in slow-motion as he jumps, and just as he reaches for the bar on the outside of the other vehicle, time speeds up again and he grabs the bar and lands where he intended. Now that he has turned into a small boy we realize we must take him to the clock house to turn him back into a man. There was more to this. I was in the house, at least once, with several other adults. I think they were only women. Maybe they were my sisters."

The patient rooms were set up more like a typical hospital wing. They lined both sides of a long hallway. I was working with a gentleman named Andy, but I don't know if he actually worked there, if he was a consultant or maybe he was a new employee. Andy and I were moving artwork from the walls. I was taking it down and setting it on the floor. He was taking some of it and moving it all to one hook on a wall. At first I thought he was simply rearranging it then I realized what he was doing. There were alot of storage cabinets. I was going through them, at some woman's request, to see what we might be able to get rid of. Doctor C came in and I was asking his thoughts on some of the things that I thought we could get rid of. The woman had wanted us to get rid of some things that Doctor C felt we should keep. The cabinets were all hanging on the walls a little higher than my head. I had to reach up to open them and try to reach the things inside to see what was actually there. The cabinets opened from both sides of the wall so you could access the things inside from the patient room or from the other side of the wall. At least some of them weren't very deep, and I recall that at least some of them just had two shelves in them. In one cabinet in particular I found some children's books. They were thick like adult paperbacks, yet they were stories for children. When I saw them I realized that those cabinets must open into the children's rooms. Doctor C was standing there with me. We were kind of laughing about not agreeing with the woman who had instructed me to clean them out. When I was looking to see what else was in the children's cabinet the books began to fall over and I was having trouble getting them to stand. We started laughing again. For some reason I wanted or felt I needed to get into some of the patient rooms. I opened one of the doors to what I thought was an empty room and found that it was now occupied. I saw a nurse and asked her which rooms were empty. She said they were now all occupied. I was surprised and a bit frustrated because this prevented me from doing what I wanted to do. Someone told me that many of the patients were there because they were recovering from gum surgery."
"0544"	"(2003-02-16)"	"I had gone to Kroger late one evening to pick up a couple of things. The parking spaces were parallel to the front of the store. The end of the row was even with the left frame of the door. There was a space open close to the end of that row. I pulled up and zipped into that space. As I did this I saw other people very upset, some milling around and some leaving. I noticed that the store was completely dark and closed. Then I saw a sign on the door that said the store was closed due to someone accidentally shooting someone as a result of trying to help them. I think there was at least one person lying on the ground. There were police officers there and they had taped off an area with the yellow tape that we see at a crime site. I think they have covered up one body. I think there were emergency vehicles there as well. I went ahead and got in my car. To leave I had to drive into the taped off area and then back out again. I either had to drive under or through the tape."

"0546"	"(2003-02-21)"	"I was at lunch with Bill C. we drove back to the office and I saw Pam Ta. I realized she lived next-door. But at this point I am at my home instead of the office. I was going to invite her in to see my living room as I thought she would really enjoy the warm, comfortable feeling it provides. Before I could say anything she invited me in to her house so I went. The houses seemed to be attached and seemed to share a raised wooden deck on the front. I went in. Her decor was rustic. I liked it. I thought it very much looked like her style."
"0547"	"(2003-02-21)"	"I was in St. Joe with Matthew but at our house - not Mother's house. Matthew and I went for a walk outside. There was alot of snow on the ground. I started off through the woods at one point and Matthew stopped me. He said that was not the path, that if we went that way we would be in danger. I don't know if he said something about bears or if that's just what I thought. As we were walking we saw some children sledding. However, they were sledding down a stream of water. I thought that was a bad idea because I was afraid for their health. I hoped they would go straight home from there and get dry and warm. We saw another woman with children there. Matthew told me that he wanted to go home. Where we were must have been a separate getaway that I owned. He was only the size of about a 12-year-old. However, I asked him if he wanted to go home because he wanted to go up and see Ashley B. He admitted that he did. I was concerned because that would be alot of driving. It's an hour and a half home, then another hour plus to Lafayette and then yet another almost two hours to Ashley B's. I know he has driven that long at once before but I was still concerned. Part of my concern might have been because of the weather and the time of day, or night, that he might be doing the driving."
"0548"	"(2003-02-22)"	"I was at CIIS. The school had misunderstood a planned visit. They thought a student had planned a family event there and the school was welcoming the event. Terri O thought it might be a problem when they realized the event was curriculum related. She wrote someone a note about a hypothetical situation, because she didn't want to point out the misunderstanding until she realized that everything would still work out okay. Now it seems that at least some of CIISC were there already. I asked Mary Kay C and Karyn L where they were headed from there, to Wisconsin or Oregon. some of us, all women, are in swimsuits in a facility that looks like a YMCA. We are outside at a pond. Paige, from the TV show Trading Spaces is there. We are instructed to reach inside alligator's mouths to find food. Paige has her hand deep inside the mouth of an alligator and is saying, look, my alligator doesn't seem to mind at all. She is twisting his jaws and playing around. But no one seems to be finding anything. Then a man, someone trained for this type of thing, comes up and puts his hand even deeper down the mouth of the alligator Paige had. I was remembering something I saw on TV where a contestant had to go into a murky pond and try to dig something she couldn't even see out of the mud. The pond had five crocodiles in it and there was a sharpshooter standing by the edge of the pond prepared to shoot the crocodile if she got in trouble. I wanted to know the difference between alligator's and crocodiles. Someone said you can do things underwater and alligator's won't bother you but crocodiles will. Now we were inside, some of us were sitting waiting on others. We were still in our swimsuits. I had my jeans with me and was thinking about pulling them on while I was waiting. When the others came we headed to the locker room. I couldn't remember which locker was mine. I knew the general vicinity and that it was next to Susan J's but that was all. There was a young girl with us and she began opening lockers a little bit to try to help me find mine. I told her not to do that because we shouldn't be opening other people's lockers. I noticed one wasn't closed properly because their clothes were caught in the door. I pushed the clothes in for them so the door would close properly. When the young girl was opening the lockers she saw a bag of snack chips and wanted some but I told her no because they belonged to someone else. I asked Susan J if she remembered which locker was hers. I knew I would be able to find mine then since I knew mine was right next to hers. She said she didn't remember which one was hers."
"0549"	"(2003-02-17)"	"I was on the TV show Joe Millionaire. Early on I mentally took myself out of the competition because I recognized that I was just so different than all the other woman. Once I did that, the dynamics between myself and Evan changed dramatically. We became buddies, I suppose. I think I also just told him that I was mentally taking myself out of the competition and why. I think I became for him the person that he could trust and confide in. We started spending alot of time together. Primarily just when he needed someone to talk to. I was that person."

"0551"	"(2003-02-22)"	"I had gone to New York City to try to find Matthew because he had not returned my calls. I had finally found him and he was with Ashley B. He couldn't talk to me or he wouldn't because he was with Ashley B and she didn't want to see me or talk to me because she was embarrassed about what happened. I decided that I at least wanted to take their child with me. They had a baby named Billy. I wanted to take Billy with me. Then there was another man there with me, to help me. Matthew and I were alone talking. I was telling him how very concerned I was about him getting back together with Ashley B and how concerned I was that he had taken off for New York and that after our last conversation he didn't call me back to let me know what was going on or how he was doing. Now someone else was there too. I had left Billy with them - for them to watch him. They were going to do something that was just going to take a couple of seconds so they handed Billy to someone that they thought was with us but it was a total stranger. The stranger took off with Billy. Then I was really upset. This man who was with me was going to help me try to find Billy. I think I told he and Ashley B to stay were they were and Matthew and I would go try to find Billy. I don't know if we ever did. We were back at our home. Matthew and I were talking about him going back to school. I told him that he needed to clean the kitchen, bathrooms, and his bedroom before he left because they were such a mess from he and Ashley B being there. The bathroom was especially a mess. The Koala bear was sitting in the bathroom and it's fur was stuck all over the bathroom floor. I think another stuffed animal was the same way. The floor was just really nasty. I had gone in to use the bathroom and found all that mess. It reminded me that I intended to tell Matthew that he had to do that cleaning before he went back to school. When I was talking to him about that I was also talking to him about getting back together with Ashley B. I was trying to let him know how concerned I was without letting him know just how upsetting it was for me."
"0552"	"(2003-02-23)"	"I was at St. Joe. I don't know who I was or who I was with. We had started some kind of a carnival I think. We were selling tickets from the kitchen. This is very odd. It's as though we were at the old house in the kitchen, sitting at the table selling tickets. Yet, it is as though it was outside as well. People would come up and hand us their money and then go on to the carnival. It seems that maybe it was a penny a person to enter. I don't anything about the carnival or anything like that. When we first set up to start selling the ticket. We had a money tray with rolls of coins. At the last minute I thought we should have two trays so I was quickly trying to divide the money for another tray. We were only doing this for a couple of hours in the evening. We had decided that we would quit selling tickets at 8 o'clock. I looked at the clock the last time and it was 8:39 and I was cleaning up. I was wondering where everyone had gone. I guess there were members of the family that should have been there helping me. I just kept busy cleaning up. I was imagining someone saying something to me and I would respond, well, there was stuff to do so I was keeping busy. There was something about something sitting there that needed to be cleaned up. It had been sitting there for a long time. I was at the kitchen sink and doing dishes or rinsing out things that had a lot of food or something leftover in them."

"0554"	"(2003-03-01)"	"Jennifer K came over. I was asking her about the results of her visit to the neurologist. It seems that there was some confusion in some tests results that even prompted her to be referred to a neurologist but certainly when she went to the neurologist and had further testing. I think they may have mixed up her test results with someone else. It seems that there was no need for concern. The things that they had found were actually someone else."
"0555"	"(2003-03-01)"	"I was explaining to a man about the Maori Drawing. I was telling him about drawing a circle in the dirt that is as tall as your body and as wide as your arm span. I said to him, which is probably pretty close to the same. He doubted that was true. He went up to the wall, maybe a chalkboard, and was calculating what seemed to be his arm span. It was 66 inches. I thought to myself, That is five feet and six inches. Since I had been standing next to him I realized that he wasn't much taller than me so it was likely pretty accurate. I went up to him. I don't know if I actually said that to him, or something about what he was doing and my thoughts that 5 ft 6 in was pretty accurate. Maybe I was going to ask him that. Then I thought, I'm 5 ft 3 in and I have 2 inch heels on right now and you're not much taller than me. I don't know if I was just thinking it or if I actually said it to him."
"0556"	"(2003-03-01)"	"I was with Matthew. We were looking at some newspapers. The one newspaper had quite a few, maybe 4 or 5, sections of full-color comic strips. It wasn't a Sunday paper. I thought that was very unusual. There was another black and white newspaper that I was looking at. It had comic strips in the business section, where they announce people's new positions. Someone wrote a comic strip about each of these people. I thought whoever was responsible for it wouldn't have alot of time to come up with or create them. In one of them, one man had alot of names. This man had maybe ten or twelve names. I thought that was very unusual. Matthew and I were looking at these newspapers together. We both got up and I was going to use the bathroom. He had gotten there first and had started to run a bath. I went into another bathroom. He saw me going in there. I said I was just going to use this one since you are getting ready to take a bath in the other."
"0557"	"(2003-03-02)"	"I was working in a large office. There were quite a few employees and many rooms or offices. I don't know who all of the employees were. One of the employees was Cameron Mannheim from a TV show about attorneys. I suspect that it is a law office but I don't think it was because of her. There is also a baby at the office. I think the baby belongs to one of the employees. We are watching the baby while the employee is away. I'm the one that gets stuck changing all of the diapers. No one else seems willing. I couple of times I picked the baby up and felt the diaper and realized that he needed to be changed. The baby's name is Brian. My brother Brian F is in one part of this dream. I am pointing to each of them saying, Big Brian, little Brian. I said it a couple of times, as if I am introducing them to each other but I say it more than twice. I leave the baby in the kind of seat that you lay newborns in. I thought I had left him with Cameron - that she was going to watch him for a few minutes. When I went back to Cameron to get him he wasn't there. She said, What do you mean where is he? I just walked away for a minute. I panicked prior to that thinking that I might have walked away without making sure that Cameron was going to watch him for me. When she said that I was reassured that she had agreed to keep an eye on him. We panicked because he wasn't there. We started going to all of these rooms or offices to look for him. Alot of these rooms were two rooms in one. The first room was small, maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. At the back of the room was a door to another room that was an even smaller square. We would go in each, open both doors to check and the moving on to the next. We were going all over. Cameron had gone into one room and a man came out. I think there was a meeting with some attorneys going on in that room. This man had on a white shirt with a tie. He was balding, short, small frame. He said, well, we may have what you're looking for. Then another attorney came out holding little Brian. He said, We just thought you might like a break from watching him. I'm thinking, Well that's great but you don't just take him without telling anyone. He had him bundled up in a blanket and hat and such. I wondered why he had him so bundled up because we were indoors and it wasn't cold."
"0558"	"(2003-03-02)"	"I was on a campus but I'm not sure which one. Matthew and Chris H were both there. It seems that there were a number of different things going on. I was going for a run. There was a young girl in front of me. She had long blonde hair pulled up into a ponytail. It was bouncing and swishing around and hitting her in the face. I realized that I had my hair in a ponytail. I didn't think mine was swinging around as much but mine wasn't as long either. She was very clumsy and not moving very quickly. There wasn't room for me to get around her and I was getting frustrated. I wanted her to get out of the way so I could really start running. I was in the backseat with Matthew and Chris H. Three of their friends were in the front seat. I was feeling very sleepy so I leaned over and rested against Matthew. I don't know if I really slept or if I was just half-asleep. I had some kind of interaction with Chris H. I was thinking about the fact that he is such a nice man. I was more comfortable talking with him than I expected to be or than unusual. Maybe I had become more comfortable talking with."
"0559"	"(2003-03-02)"	"I'm not sure where I am. I am somewhere with alot of people. I know some of them. There were two very large women there. They were dressed so that alot of their breasts were showing. Some man there found that very attractive. They felt very good about themselves with the size that they were. They were easily 350 pounds. I could never be comfortable with myself at that weight. I can't imagine liking the way I felt or looked at that size. John Carter and Abby were there from the TV show ER. Somebody came by. I think they were shooting at us. I think he hit both of the very large women. They both fell underwater. John and Abby were going to dive down and try to help them and bring them up. When they went down they got stuck on something. When John and Abby went down they got them both out but in doing so Abby got stuck. Her head was in something that looked like a steering wheel. John went back down and was able to get her back out. We are all indoors. I think we work here. There had been one CD playing in a CD changer that held about 12 different CD's. This CD was somehow related to the shooter. Maybe he knew something because of this CD. I started adding other CD's to create confusion. I just added a few at a time. Now I am outside. Somehow because of the CD's I could identify him, or maybe adding the other CD's was making it more difficult for him. At the same time I am making it easier for us to identify him. He came by and I knew it was him. He knew it was me that was putting the CD's in there. It was making him angry. I don't know if it was because it was making something more difficult for him or because it was making it easier for him to be identified. I threw one CD disc at him like a Frisbee. It missed him. I think he threw a couple at me, but those were in jewel cases. I realize he is now after me so he cannot be identified. Everyone there knew that I was the next target. Because of that I could help catch him by making myself even more of a target. We had put these other CD's in the CD changer. I had become very upset, emotionally or mentally, about this whole thing. My doctor had prescribed some medication for me. I took one or two of those. We knew this man was coming back again. Now where we work is a police station. Michael J. Fox is one of the police officers. There was another officer there as well. He was a black man. He did not want to be part of trying to get this man. We were sitting in this officer's house, in his bathroom. Michael J. Fox was talking to him about a bathtub in there. He said, Come on, you know you're so close to retirement. You've been working on fixing up this house. You've got this one last project. You want to get that tub replaced and fixed up. You want something much nicer. This will be the last ticket before you retire. He had convinced this officer, although he was still reluctant, to help us catch the shooter. We were preparing to do something that was going to be very dangerous. We were sure this was going to allow us to catch him. I didn't want any part of it either. I was afraid because I knew I was his primary target now. Michel J. Fox convinced that for that reason I was the key to catching him. He said they really needed me to do that. He was putting the responsibility on me to keep this man from hurting other people. They couldn't catch him without me or something to that effect. My participation would allow them to catch him before he hurt anyone else. I reluctantly agreed but I was thinking, I don't care. I've taken my drugs. I was in a mental fog from the drugs. They gave me two belts to put on. One might have been a gun belt. The other also had something on it but I don't know what. They positioned me lying on the floor inside a doorway to the outside. We were on the roof of the building. I looked outside and there was a young woman walking across the roof. She was a younger woman. She looked like Janice on the TV show Friends. She was wearing animal print clothing on and high heels. She had long, full, wavy, dark hair. We knew that she was his marker. She had been acting as though she was lost or looking for someone. She was actually looking for me so she could tell the shooter where I was. She did see me lying right inside the door. At that point we knew we were set, that he would come up there to shoot at me inside this door. Michael told me to stay put while he went downstairs. He was going to try to shoot the man before he ever got up to the roof."

"0561"	"(2003-03-04)"	"I was part of an extremely dysfunctional family. There were two daughters. One was about 11-12 and the other 7-8 years of age. They were extremely belligerent to their mother, and disrespectful and don't do anything they are asked, etc. They're dressed absolutely awful. I finally told them that they are going to get cleaned up and changed. I gave the first one an hour in the bathroom and the next one an hour. And I tell them that they will come out looking and the way their mother and I would like them to look. Initially they were very sassy and sarcastic in interpreting what that meant. Once they got started they yelled out into the kitchen a question and their mom started to respond real sassy. I said, No. Stop. Answer them in a different way. So then she was very nice about how she answered. When they came out they looked very nice and respectable. They had done a really good job. A bunch of us were in the kitchen preparing dinner. BJ was there. I think this must have been BJ's house. She had two stoves. They were each on separate yet adjoining walls. So it was hard to use. I was sitting on the floor with the youngest girl. They opened both ovens at once. I grabbed her and held her very still to make sure she wouldn't get burnt by both of those doors opening at once on either side of her. I told her how dangerous that was. They said something about my kitchen. I said, Well, I just have one stove. I do my baking in it. Then they were fixing steak and baked potatoes for dinner. But we were eating everything except the steak first because the steak wasn't done yet and they had just fixed a couple of baked potatoes. They were cutting them up and giving each person just a little bit of each one. That was fine with me because the potatoes were way too big for me to eat a whole one myself. A little bit after that they were still in the kitchen and I was sitting in another room with the husband. The mom and someone else was canning green beans. I called the little girl to come out there with us because I didn't want her to get burnt. Those canning jars and the steam from the canners can get so hot. I was concerned that she would get scalded. We heard a timer go off so we knew that some of the jars were done. The mother brought a couple of them in to show us. It had not worked. The jars had not sealed and the beans and something else that she was canning looked very odd. Everybody was upset because it didn't work. All this produce was going to go to waste. Then we went to a swimming pool. I don't think this was the same family. We saw another family come. They had two male adults that were about 4 feet 11 inches in height. They both had a number of severe mental and physical disabilities. The one, I said, Oh no. That's the one that has that really, loud, obnoxious laugh. I was thinking about leaving. Then as they were getting ready to go in the pool I noticed that the other one, one of them was getting ready to tell him he couldn't get into the pool and he was pointing out that he had on some kind of swimming diaper that was going to make it okay. He had this thing wrapped around his head, including his face. It looked kind of like plastic but when they pulled it off his face was so completely disfigured. It was almost as though you couldn't see eyes, a nose, or a mouth. I was trying very hard not to look. They took the plastic off and then put the plastic back on and conformed it to his face to make it look more as though he had a normal face. They just laid the plastic back on. They asked me to help and I felt very uncomfortable and I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable because I didn't know what I was doing and such. I said something to that effect. He just took my hand and shook it and said thank you, as if to say that was nice of you too, to just acknowledge that."
"0562"	"(2003-03-09)"	"I went to the barn to get my horse. I was going to ride him but I think I also wanted to get him for someone else. I was holding the reins and he kept going around in circles, tangling the reins and making it impossible for me to get on him. I finally got him to stop. I untangled the reins and was walking him over to the other person. There was a place that the grassy area ended and a wooded area began. In the woods the ground cover was something besides grass but I can't describe what, except that it was brown. I stepped into the wooded area with the horse and noticed a snake. I decided to quickly get him out of there because I know snakes can frighten horses. As I began to leave the wooded area I saw lots and lots of snakes. Some were by themselves and in other places there were bunches of them together. I'm afraid of snakes so I was feeling very anxious and wanted to get out of there quickly. I stepped over at least one snake to get out of there. I told someone about all of the snakes in the wooded area. For some reason I took the horse into an expensive restaurant. It seems that maybe it was a shortcut to where I was going. I wasn't being very careful. I didn't think I needed to be. So I didn't have a very short hold on the reins. I was kind of letting the horse lead me and move where he wanted to in the restaurant. Someone working in the restaurant got upset with me so I took the horse back out. I was standing inside a building and it began to rain. We were in California. The grass was very brown. Everyone was excited that it was raining because it doesn't rain there very often and we really needed it. The rain was coming down very hard. There were several sculptures in the grass. At least I think they were sculptures. They were made of a very lightweight metal, maybe aluminum. They were various shapes like a ball, a multi-sided star, maybe an octagon. I can't recall how many different ones there were. As the rain came down some of them began to move or blow away. I ran out into the rain and stopped at least one of them at least once. I think I put something into the bottom of one of them to try to keep it in place. The water was beginning to collect on the ground. I don't know if it was collecting on the grass or on the cement. I was thinking about the fact that it was doing that. Maybe I was concerned that it was a problem but I can't recall why it was a problem."

"0564"	"(2003-03-12)"	"I was in a house that I lived in with 3-year-old Matthew. It was the middle of the day. We were outside. Matthew was riding his big wheel. I was walking while he was riding. We had gone quite a little distance. He had asked me something and then I turned away from him. When I turned back I couldn't see him anymore. Even though it looked like a straight view as far as I could see in all directions around me, I couldn't see him anywhere. I just panicked. I started running and yelling and calling out his name. I couldn't find him. I finally decided I didn't want to walk away yet. I knew that I couldn't move very fast this way because I was walking. I finally decided to go back to the house and get the car and drive to find him. So I went back to the house and got my keys. I was dressed for work. I went outside to get in the car and there he was - sitting there on his big wheel, looking as though he knew he was in trouble and he was so dirty. Before I could say anything, he was talking - as though he was alot older than three - you didn't even have to say it. I've been yelled at by, I don't know whom, but these other people already yelled at him. So I didn't say anything right away. I picked him up and held him but out away from me because he was so dirty and I didn't want to get my work clothes all dirty. I took him in the house and thought about sitting him down but he was so dirty and I didn't want to get the dirt all over the carpet. So I took him into the bathroom and was going to just sit him right in the tub. It was as if he was cooperating with his body. I said okay fine. So when I actually went to sit him down he ended up on his stomach and kind of sliding down. But then he ended up sitting up."

"0566"	"(2003-03-15)"	"I was at the BE Retreat Center for our last group meeting for the semester. Since it was our last one we were combining our meeting with another group. There was one woman in attendance that I recognized as someone that was supposed to be in our group originally but couldn't for some reason. Initially we were each to introduce ourselves and tell a little bit about ourselves. I said very little when it was my turn because I didn't want to tell these strangers very much about myself. Someone told me I should tell them about my name change. I did so in a humorous manner, saying, Elizabeth H enrolled in the program but Anna F is taking it. I went on to say something to the effect that they should watch out if they ever meet Anna- as though she is the evil alter ego. Some people were just looking at me as though they were totally confused and others laughed. As the discussion continued, it seemed that one or two of the men were primary figures in the other group. I had the impression that throughout the semester they would go into another room to get props whenever they wanted to, to get things to support their discussion. I thought that was a nice benefit they had. I was sitting next to Garnet P. I asked her if she goes to Tuesday morning classes because I was surprised that I had never seen or never noticed her there. She said that herself and another woman never go. They couldn't work it out with their schedule so they have only been attending small group sessions. I left the group and was headed out to the parking lot. I was carrying a box but I don't know what it had it in. It was about the size of a layer cake. As I was approaching the steps leading to the front door I saw Sister Betty going down a lower flight of steps. She said, This way, indicating that was the way to the next meeting we were due at. I told her I was going outside because my car was parked at the front door and I had to move it. I said I would just meet her there. There was quite a bit of snow outside, though it was in the melting stage and alot of it looked very dirty. I pulled my car into an angled parking space but not in the way someone would normally do that. I think I entered from a strange angle. I was debating whether to reposition my car, move, or leave it there. As I was thinking about this another car pulled in next to me. I finally decided to move. I pulled out and was going to try another odd maneuver and thought to myself, Yeah. Right! Like I should really do this with this car. I pulled up the aisle a little bit and was going to back into another space to be able to turn around but ended up just turning around going forward into a large block of empty spaces."

"0568"	"(2003-03-16)"	"I was at USC. I was sitting in a room working at a computer. It was at a table with a high stool type chair. There wasn't much room. There were rows of table without much room between them. I was sitting there working at the computer and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that Ben D was trying to sneak up behind me. I turned around and saw him. He came around the other side of the table and said, Hi Sweetie. We hugged. We chatted very briefly then he turned and walked away to put something in his office. His office was not very far away. He was wearing navy blue sweat pants and a striped shirt and tennis shoes. As he came back out, I was stretching and rubbing my eyes because I had been looking at the computer screen so long. He said something about that. I said I just forgot to bring my eye drops with me. I said I should probably go try to get some. He told me where the nearest drug store or something was. He said, Of course, they're going to be getting ready for the St. Patrick's Day parade now. Then he was saying something about the fact that they don't get as many people coming in there as they used to because they're located in a small strip center. The big strip centers are in other locations and not as many people come in there as used to."

We thought that the enemy was hiding and waiting for us so we were very cautiously entering this town. Trying to see if we could see the enemy hiding from us. It turned out that they weren't after all. We went all the way through the town. I don't know why we were there."
"0570"	"(2003-03-17)"	"I was with Alicia J. At least during part of the dream I was a midget. We had midget cars that we were driving. Mine was a stick shift that I was learning to drive and there was some kind of race that I won. There was also a house that Alicia J had that all of these artistic people came to - something to do with arts. Something about a fireplace. I was also going to this town with Mari Kate S and Rachel S. We came to this house that had alot of Easter stuff for sale in their yard. It had many pieces of the same things - like you would find in a store. Aunt P and Aunt H were there also."
"0571"	"(2003-03-20)"	"I was working at the CAS office. The office was a little bit different. Not alot but a little bit different than in waking life. It was primarily Bill C and I working there. I don't think there was anything about Haley N. Blair K did come to mind during the dream. Bill C had just come back from a meeting with an accountant maybe. One of the accountants came with him, a woman. It might have been Lydia from SDI. Anyway, he came back and went into his office and closed his door. Lydia was still at the office but I don't know where. I saw two men standing at the front desk so I went out to see how I could help them. It turned out that one of them was Vince P. I went to the counter and as I looked up and asked if I could help them I realized this. I said, Vince P! He looked up and was also surprised to see me. We hugged. I asked him where he has been and what had happened to him. I told him that I had tried to call him and left messages and he didn't return my call. He said he had just been so busy. He didn't say much else. He introduced me to the man that he was with and said they were there to buy some books. I asked him if he wanted just books or sets. I explained that the CD was not the entire book but a companion CD. They decided that they did want sets. I asked how many. They mentioned a couple of quantities and I think they finally decided on 66 sets. I told them that it would take me a few minutes to get them together. They said that was fine, that they would wait. I went in back and started getting the sets together. Lydia came back and was talking to me about the fact that they were going to start making financial cutbacks. What this meant to me was that they weren't going to do the e-articles. I got really upset. I said, I don't understand that because there is no additional cost involved. She started to talk and tried to justify it. I didn't want to hear it. We were silent for a little while. I finally said, Lydia. Really. Help me to understand this because there is no additional cost involved in these. There is no printing, no proofing, no creation cost. I just don't get it. She said, We've just been overspending. I don't know if I just thought this had something to do with Blair K or if she actually said something. I thought, yeah. Here we go again. Bill C has gone way out on a limb. He's made this commitment to Blair K. I didn't think he should do it and I'm the one that is paying for it again. I was really upset by this. So we quit talking about it again. I was trying to get the sets of books ready for Vince P. I was pulling books out of the cabinet. I realized that some of them were used and were in really bad shape. I was aggravated at that point because someone had put these really crummy books in there. Then I realized that they weren't all BCB. That some of them were different types of books. I was trying to sort out the ones other than BCB. I didn't want to give these really bad, tattered ones to Vince P. I wanted to make sure that I only gave him nice, new ones. I was wondering how they were going to carry all of these. I found two boxes that were folded up. Lydia was helping me. She taped the bottoms of the boxes up and then she boxed them for me as I completed each set and then taped the boxes closed. When I actually got ready to take them up front, now instead of in boxes they were in these two large plastic things that were shaped like some kind of bird. The top was kind of like the head of the bird and it twisted on and off. There were two of them. I picked them up by the necks of the birds. She sprayed one and was wiping it off because it looked kind of dusty. I grabbed them by the neck and took them out front to Vince P. When I did that there were 4-5 women standing out there now also. I took care of Vince P. It seemed that at least one of the other women was also a DDSI person. I recognized her and knew her name. I grabbed some forms that were lying at the front desk but then I excused myself and went and got some regular product order forms. I started filling in the form. She gave me her name and I didn't tell her that I already knew who she was or that I remembered her or recognized her. I asked her to wait for one second and I went into Bill C's office. He was in there with 3-4 other people. They were watching TV. I stuck my head inside the door and said, Bill C, can you please come out and help me. There's like 4-5 people out here waiting. He didn't look at me. He lifted his hand and waved it at me as if to wave me away and said, yeah. Yeah. I'll be out in a minute. It was as though he didn't want to face me or talk to me. So I went ahead and went back out. I was talking to this woman. I think her name was Cindy [unknown in waking life] . She told me what she wanted but it was something for her car- like service on her car. There was a TV in the lobby and they were all watching TV. After she told me what she wanted she said, So, I'll just sit here and wait. I said, excuse me. You're in the wrong place. That's not what we do here. We're not an auto service place. We do sales training. She made some comment as though I was wrong. I just said, I'm sorry. That's just not what we do here. We do sales training. At that point I realized that they were all together and they got kind of irritated and left. Then I had some puppies at the office. One of them was real and one wasn't, yet they both were moving around as though they were real. I went to the box to let my puppy out. I said, I bet you're hungry. I bet you both are. I realized, or thought that I hadn't fed them for a day or two and I felt really, really guilty. Really Bad! I thought, well at least it won't be like soiling the carpet or anything because they were in their box and they had been going in there. So I was going to go feed them. They were really cute - all chubby and very, very soft and brown fur. Kind of reminds me of Sir Gallahad's fur."
"0572"	"(2003-03-27)"	"I was sleeping on the left side of my bed, facing right. Someone came into the room and had climbed up on the bed on his knees. I was trying to move my arm to swipe at him to see if he really was there or if I was imagining things. I actually felt the mattress go down as it would if someone else climbed on the bed. I finally jerked my arm."

"0575"	"(2003-04-08)"	"I was on a college campus. Mother and Daddy were with me. We were going to be staying there for a couple of days. Daddy went up and talked to one of the administrators and was trying to make himself look good. However, when he thought he would suit him well he said that he was there for me and I felt that he used me. Mother and I were talking about that and kind of laughing, how he needs to make himself look important and if he thinks something will make him look like a good person in someone else's eyes then he will use me or someone else to do so. I said that it wasn't a problem, that it didn't bother me. I thought it was funny to watch how people do things like that. There were some male students were acting as hospitality ministers and greeting people, taking care of their luggage and things such as that. At first they couldn't tell us where our room was or where we would be staying. Then they did find out. I went there and find out that they were putting across a campus street in another building on campus. The room was 268. In the first room and I had lain down to take a nap. I had gotten a few things out. I had gotten out a can of a soft drink. I finally received notice that our other room was ready and they were going to be moving us over there. I got all of my things together and some other employees of the campus came in and were going to clean the room. I cleaned it up just enough that they would know that they needed to change the pillowcase because I had used the pillow. Then I heard one of the students talking to daddy about our luggage and saying, You'll know when your luggage is coming up. You'll hear it coming up. You'll hear something like two thumps, something like eleven times you would hear them. You would know then that your luggage was on your floor. Still, someone else would be there to get it and take it to our room. I went to the room and was looking for a soft drink. There was something like a can dispenser under a counter. I couldn't actually see the dispenser, however, until I started to pull it out. I started to pull one out and saw that it was orange juice. We were questioning whether we had packed too much or just the right amount. If it was just the right amount and it was the difference between being supportive and being an enabler. There was also something about some kind of contest which was also related to the luggage."

"0577"	"(2003-04-13)"	"Bill C had just come back from vacation. We went to have lunch. When we walked in the restaurant we noticed that Blair K was there having lunch with someone. Bill C ducked behind a wall because he didn't want Blair K to see us. He wanted us to be able to have lunch alone and catch up on business issues. He wasn't sure how he wanted to deal with Blair K yet. He wasn't successful. Blair K had seen him and came up to us. He invited us to join them. Bill C just told him that we needed to catch up on business issues. Blair K returned to his table and the hostess seated us. We were sitting there eating at a six-foot long table. I was at the very left end of one side and Bill C was across from me, but in the second to last chair. There were people we didn't know seated next to me. While we were waiting Theresa S and Stephen S along with another CRHP sister and her husband came up and decided to join us, without being invited or asking if it was okay. I don't know who the other CRHP sister was. It was though it was not a waking life CRHP sister. Theresa S and Stephen S sat down to my left at the end of the table. The other couple sat to Bill C's left. They were talking to each other, kind of across us. I introduced them to Bill C, though they didn't really seem to pay attention or acknowledged each other. I could tell by the look on Bill C's face that he was aggravated because he had wanted to discuss business with me. I was uncomfortable and not sure what to do. I finally leaned over to Theresa S and said, I'm really sorry. I don't want to be rude. But this is my boss and he had wanted this to be a working lunch for us. She apologized and said that was fine. Bill C and I got up and went to sit at another table."
"0578"	"(2003-04-16)"	"I believe that I'm at BJ's house. There are 3-4 young men in one room of the house. At least one of them has an electric guitar. They are in there playing music but its kind of like hard rock or some such. Most of it I really don't like at all. BJ and I both go in. BJ says something to them about the fact that they have to play something that everyone can play. She then walks out. I jokingly say, and if you don't change, I'll be back in. As if to say, then you'll have to deal with me. I think Matthew, JC W, and Joshua Grayson, from the TV show American Idol, were three of them. I'm not sure if there was a fourth. I went up to Joshua. We were both standing facing in the same direction. I put my arm around his back, lean over, and say something to him. I don't know what, but I was joking with him. He just smiled a broad smile and laughed a little. I smiled back at him and then walked out. There are four astronauts inside a space capsule. There is a malfunction and two of them die. The other two are really struggling to hold on. One of them is Joshua G. They are floating inside in their spacesuits. They are holding on to the hatch. They are very, very cold. One of them is reaching, trying to get a little bit of air come through the hatch, as though that would warm them. Something happens in the capsule. I think part of it breaks off. They are now close to earth and in fact come in contact with the ground. They start scraping along the ground. They're very excited and shouting, Look. Grass. Grass. Right before that they said, Look we just passed someone's house. They just missed hitting the roof. They finally come out of the capsule. They don't know where they are but they do realize that they are at someone's home. They no longer have their spacesuits on. They are walking across this yard. There's family stuff, toys and such, strewn all over the yard. However, there is something in the yard that looks like large marshmallows and it sticks to their shoes. They have a little bit of trouble walking through that and trying to get whatever it is off of their shoes. They opened the door and knock as they enter. The family is sitting at the dinner table, eating a meal. Most of them seem surprised to see the astronauts. But the dad is a black gentleman that reminds me of Colin Powell. He doesn't seem surprised to see them. They are showing him something. They take the cover off. It almost looks like an Elmo doll with a spacesuit on. What they're taking off is the spacesuit. There is something very significant about that. They want to know what is significant about it. The dad won't answer. He just says something like, you don't need to know that. I'm left with the impression that they were part of some kind of covert government operation and they don't know what the operation was really about, and they weren't supposed to. But this dad, and this family, were part of it and did know what was going on. There is some kind of a TV show going on. One or both of these men are involved in this show. It's the holidays. There are five people on the set at one point. They begin trying to solve a puzzle. I realize that each person that is on the show that day represents one of the Twelve Days of Christmas song. One person on the show is supposed to be trying to figure out what part of that song each of the other people represents."

"0580"	"(2003-04-28)"	"I was to be in a fashion show for both the church and the apartment community. I was dressed in a black, floor-length gown that was just over one shoulder. It had a slit up the side and kind of along the side of the torso as well. Then it had little rhinestones on the part that goes up the shoulder of the bodice. They were both scheduled for the same night. There was also something else going on that night. I don't remember now what. I made the one for the apartment community and then I rushed to the church and I was too late for that one. Then I went back to the apartment community for some other things. They had some gifts for us. There was some discussion about lease renewal. Part of the dream it was daylight. It seemed that I was at the condo instead of the apartment community. I was working in the yard and there was this big piece of black something that was rolled up and someone was digging up part of the yard and unrolling it and was going to bury it there. That isn't what it was intended to be used for and I thought that was odd that it was how they were using it. I went back to the church and my car wouldn't start. I somehow moved it anyway. It was as though I picked it up and moved it and sat it alongside, by the rectory. There were three cars parked there. I kind of picked mine up and moved it to sit alongside those three, facing the same direction. Now it was dark and I went up to the back door and it was very rustic looking. Like the door and the walls almost blended together. There was no window or anything in the door. I rang the doorbell and there was a little window above the door where I could see if someone was coming or not. So I was kind of watching and it was like 9:00 and I felt bad that I was bothering them so late at night but I didn't know what else to do since my car wouldn't start. I was just going to ask someone if they could give me a jump. And Beth came to the door. She was wearing her pajamas. Of course she said she would be right out to help. I stepped inside the door while she went and got jumper cables and she came back kind of rushing. I apologized again for bothering her so late at night and I told her that I did know how to use the jumper cables. Then there were 3-4 steps coming out of the rectory. As we were coming down the steps I was explaining that I was in the fashion show there and that I was also supposed to be in a fashion show at the apartment community and had just too many things going on that night and I was rushing around and now my car wouldn't stop and I was just very apologetic."

"0582"	"(2003-05-02)"	"I was in a conference room with Bill C. We were having a meeting and he and I were sitting at the back right table. Someone else was leading the meeting. We had a number of visitors there. It seems that they were all women. The tablecloths didn't hang as well over the tables as they do in waking life and I noticed on the ends of the tables the actual metal part of the table was about 12 inches long, from the top of the table towards the floor. They were really dirty. They had something like hair clippings or cobwebs hanging. It was very disgusting looking. As soon as I noticed it I nudged Bill C and said, look at the end of the table two rows up. He looked at it and he was so disgusted that we were presenting ourselves this way, that we had allowed this happen and we had guests in and this was there. Shortly after I noticed it and pointed it out to Bill C there was a male child in the room as well. He had plugged in a hair dryer and he pointed the hair dryer at that mess and it just kind of blew up into the middle of the room, swirling around almost like a tornado. Everybody saw it. We were just horrified. The mother of the child tried to stop him. The other people in the room were kind of trying to act as though it wasn't a big deal. The child just kept doing it and the mother finally got the child under control. We took a break from the meeting to kind of get things back under control. I don't think we actually did anything. Bill C walked out of the room. I don't know where he went. I stayed for a little while. More people started coming in. It's as though we were now going to start a new meeting. I was in the room, talking to some of the different people. I started to head back towards my seat and someone said, Anna F. Don't I know you from somewhere? Do I know that name from somewhere? I briefly explained to her about my name change. I was going to explain to her about changing my first name but someone else came up and started talking to us, her primarily so I didn't get a chance to explain that to her. Then I decided to go out, I left the room and was going to use the restroom. The restroom door that I found didn't have a door handle. I reached down to the bottom of the door and pulled the door open that way. I went in and it was like a long tiled hallway, almost like a locker room. At first I was hesitant to go in because I knew that since the door didn't have a handle it obviously was not the right way to go in. But I really had to use the bathroom so I went ahead in. It was almost, it almost looked like a maze. I was trying to figure out where the stalls were or what stalls to use. I could tell there were people in there using some of them and someone actually stuck their head above one of them. I was embarrassed to be seen in there because I knew I wasn't supposed to be in there. So then I was trying to find my way out. Someone noticed that and I never did actually use the bathroom. Someone noticed that I was trying to find my way out and showed me the way out. I actually went out the way I came in. When I went out I was in a hotel. I wanted to find the elevator and leave the hotel. I was having trouble finding the elevator. For some reason I felt as though I wasn't supposed to be there or I didn't want to be seen. I didn't want anyone to know that I was trying to leave. Now it almost seemed as though I was in a well. I saw this religious sister. I think she was pushing a hospital bed that had someone in it. I saw her heading for this large size elevator that would accommodate hospital beds. I jumped into this elevator with her. She didn't really seem to question my being there or getting on this elevator with her. There were 1-2 other women on there as well, also religious sisters. They asked what floor. The one pushing the bed said she needed floor 53. Nobody else said anything. No one asked what floor I needed. I was just going to be quiet and hoped that they would all get off and that I could then go down and leave. So we went to floor 53 and two of them got off. I don't remember the hospital bed being there now. One of them was apparently going to floor 50 so she stayed on with me and started chatting with me a little bit. I was afraid that she was going to find out that I was trying to leave. Then there was like this somehow I don't think I said anything and I don't know if she suspected but now it was as though we were in this. It was like somebody that you couldn't see, or wasn't even there. Almost like something you would see in a movie scene or something like magic. Like somebody who wasn't present knew what was going on and knew that I was trying to leave. But this woman who wasn't present but who saw so to speak that I was trying to leave performed some kind of magic and she started transforming my appearance. My nails grew elegantly long and were very nicely manicured and polished. She changed what I was wearing to a very elegant yet it had something like shiny threads running through it. I think my hair became long also. When this started happening the women in the elevator with me realized what was going on and that I had been trying to leave. The person who was changing my appearance was doing this so I would be able to leave unnoticed. I was holding something when my nails began to change. There was also I'm backtracking here. I went through this bathroom thing more than once."

My office was very dark. It had a dark colored carpet. Three of the walls were dark paneling. The other wall had a very dark wallpaper. I had put up nails and hung some things. At another point I had taken them all down. I can't remember if I was having my office redecorated or if I was moving into another office. I had taken everything off the walls then I decided to take all the nails out of the wall. I was just reaching up and pull them out with my hand. Some of them, the nails had been put in these holes. They were maybe an inch or inch and a half in diameter and equally deep. The nail had been put into the wall directly in the middle of that hole. Haley N had gone out and bought some live plants that were on sale. They didn't look very good at all. They weren't healthy. They were small and scraggly. She had also bought macrame plant hangers in different colors and different color combinations. One was a pale yellow with maybe white and rust color design in it. I was hanging those plants and trying to decide which hanger would go best where. The flowerpots themselves were very dirty so I had to wash them off. That is when I was thinking that she had gotten these plants on sale and had not spent much money on them. That's why they looked so bad. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I was just surprised that she had bought something on sale that she had bought plants that looked like that. It just surprised me."

He said, I know how I can help you. I can help you enter things. He was referring to entering references into my Endnotes software. I said, do you really think you can help me with that? You're kind of little to do that aren't you? He said something to the effect that he can help. I turned and looked at him and said, well, here's what I think. I think I'm dreaming right now. And, in waking life you're alot older and I asked you to help me with this and you started and you did a good job. But, now, I don't know. You're kind of little. He said, Whooaaa!"
"0585"	"(2003-05-07)"	"A man was building a house or doing some remodels work. He was adding on to a patio. He had a lot of children, 10-12 maybe. It was a black family. They had a utility van that they used as a family car. All of the children were in the back. There was a wide age span. Some of them were close to Matthew's age. Some of them were very young. About half of them were asleep in the back of this van, kind of laying on each other. Some of them were sitting up against the side, where there was a side door. The mother was telling them not to lean on that door so they wouldn't fall out. They had come to this house. The ones that were awake got out and went to look at the patio or deck or whatever it was that he was building. From the grassy area he had created two levels of something like a decorative border. The border was small slats of something like a maple wood, varnished, that he was lying on top of each other and around. The look resembled that of butcher block. That one went in a little bit and then he did it again. So we went up to the actual level of the floor of the patio. He had poured old cement next to the old. There was one girl, probably around 18 to early 20's. Her name was Nicki T. It was almost as though she was Nicki T that worked for me at SFI. She walked on the new cement. There was something about her being the first one to walk on the new cement. I don't know if someone said that or if I just thought it. Then, some of them were walking off that cement down below. There was this really high pile of dirt that was maybe 12-13 feet high. On that pile of dirt was lots of lumber and things - building materials on this pile of dirt. Some of them were kind of walking along there, kind of on some of the lumber on the side of this pile of dirt. The lumber started to fall. I was concerned about them getting hurt but then another one went across. More lumber fell. Then the next one, something actually fell on him and knocked him over. He got right up and said he was fine. One of the things that had landed on him was a brown square box of something. But he got up right away and went on."

I wanted to hurry up and get out of there before anyone saw me. But when I went from the restroom I wanted to hurry back to my office and hoped that no one saw me. But when I got ready to walk back to the office I had to walk past two other offices and through one office. Of course, the receptionists in all three of those offices were all three women who were dressed very professionally. I think I went down there twice. The second time I realized I didn't have to go through the one office to get back to my office. There was a very narrow hallway behind the office walls. The wall was glass but at least I didn't have to walk through that office. When I went back the second time, when I got to the one office, the office was locked and all the lights were turned out. Earlier I had seen the receptionist fixing her hair and stuff. She had put some rollers in the front of her hair and taken them out. She was wearing a red business suit. When I came back the second time that office was locked, dark. Then I got to our office and the lights were all turned out. I worried for a second that Bill C had left and locked the door. Fortunately, he hadn't locked it. He had just turned the lights out. So I went in, turned the lights back on and went into my office."
"0587"	"(2003-05-09)"	"I was going on a trip with a bunch of people I know. Maybe fellow students or maybe a business trip. I'm not sure which. The place we were staying was circular in shape and there were three floors and the to get to the floors it's like we were in the center. It wasn't all that big and kind of went to the outer edge of the circle. I don't know exactly how to explain it. It's like you kind of had to lie down on your back and slide through this opening to get to the hallway that led into the guest rooms. We had gotten to this place by bus. I was one of the last ones off the bus so most of the first floor rooms were gone when I got there. I had gone into a room and was thinking about just taking that room. It wasn't like a normal hotel where they assign you a room when you check in. While I was in there looking at this room someone else came in and just started unpacking. So I had to try to find another room. It was kind of difficult how you had to go through this opening to go to the different rooms. I did the same thing at the second floor and I found a room or two but for some reason I didn't like them and I didn't want to go up to the third floor. The second and third floor rooms were more difficult to get to than the first floor. I ended up going to someone in charge and explaining that I am really uncomfortable on the second and third floor. I explained what happened when I was in the one first floor room and someone else just came in and started unpacking. They said they normally reserve a couple of the first floor rooms for emergencies. They are nicer rooms than any of the others. They felt that this was a situation that warranted them giving me one of those rooms."
"0588"	"(2003-05-09)"	"I was at some kind of a show. It was being held outdoors. It was only for women. The performers, I think, were only women. There was something before the show. I think it was at a retail store. Some of us were shopping for clothing. These very tall, circular clothing racks. At the show they had brought out some kind of refreshments. It reminds me of like tomatoes and slices of turkey and ham. We were taking some of each and rolling it together. This show happened more than once. The second time somebody was saying, the entertainers were saying, that they left the food out of the refrigerator too long and she got ill from it. And somebody I was with said they did too. I said, well, the last time we may have left it out too long. But this time we didn't. This is weird because they hadn't brought it out yet but when they did bring it out I was having trouble rolling it this time. I don't remember what I ended up doing with it. There were a lot of black women at this program. After the program I am in the car with at least two other women. I have no idea who they were. We were driving and we stopped, I don't know where, I don't think it was in traffic. But we stopped somewhere for some reason and I had my window down. I saw this young black woman standing outside on the sidewalk. I finally realized it was Nicki T from SFI. I said, Nicki T? She said, Yes! She came over and we were talking. I was happy to see her. I asked her what she was doing now. She told me she was managing our store now. I was so excited for her. I leaned out the window and said, come here and give me a hug. I gave her a big hug and congratulated her and I said, What about your dating life now? She said she's been dating the same man for a year now and he's a really good man and he treated her really well. We just talked a little while. I told the people that we were with that we could go whenever they were ready. Then I told her that I needed to get going that I couldn't keep these women waiting. I said it was really good to see her and that I was very proud of her and I congratulated her again. She was proud and glad that I was proud of her. We pulled away and I was telling the women I was that it is people like that make the work that you do worthwhile. I tried to explain to them that she had been my assistant manager and I really had some difficulties with her. I really worked with her to get her act together. I saw alot of potential in her and had made her my assistant manager and was really working hard to teach her. I said I was really pleased that she had gotten her act together and that she was now the store manager and that she was now in a good healthy relationship."

"0590"	"(2003-05-18)"	"A bunch of the family was at Bob F's trailer. He and his family lived in this trailer. Bob F, Todd A, Bev, Rachel S and I were all there. I don't know who else. All of these people dressed in black, with black hoods over their faces, came running up outside the trailer. They had guns and surrounded the trailer. Someone said something about a certain song and that a certain song prompted them to come after us. Bob F called a radio station and asked them to play this song. Bob F turned it up very loud so they could hear it outside hoping it would make them leave. They didn't. They just opened fire. I was holding Rachel S. We were all running around, screaming. We didn't know where to go. We were trying to find a place to hide to avoid the gunfire. I felt the gunfire rip down my back. I heard someone yelling for Todd A. It didn't seem that any time had passed and I was walking around trying to find everyone. I kept saying something to Bob F and he wouldn't answer me. I reached up and touched his face and he just brushed it as though he had felt something. I realized then that I had died and that he couldn't see or hear me. I started walking through the trailer and I saw BJ. I said something to BJ and she turned around and said something to me. I said, Oh. You can see me. She said, Of course I can see you. Then I saw Bev. Bev made me realize that she had not made it either. At that point I realized that BJ was getting ready for our funeral. John S had survived but I don't know if he was there. Someone said that he was pretty much living in a daze now. He was being very technical. I realized that I had saved Rachel S. I started screaming and crying, I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. I saved Rachel S. Bob F had survived. Somewhere along here Jennifer F came in. In listening to things I realized it was all her fault. Something she had done caused all these people to come after her and instead they ended up killing some many of us, but not her. Somebody said Bill F hadn't spoken since this happened. I thought that was additionally hard on Mother and Daddy. Apparently they had survived. I know that Bev and I died. But I don't know who else. I think Todd A did. I saw Rachel S and I called her. She was with Bev. Because she is so young she can see us and hear us. I went up to her and I said, Rachel S, come here. She came to me and I hugged her. But then she started coughing. I said something to somebody or somebody said something. She was getting sick and if they didn't hurry she would die. Somebody, some emergency workers, took her and put her on a stretcher. There was some man there that could talk to the dead. He was talking to the emergency workers and to Bev. I don't know if they saved her or not."
"0591"	"(2003-05-18)"	"I was with two other people. We had these things about the size of a credit card. They were in two pieces. We would put them together with our arms stretched up in the air, and it would lift us up into the air and through an opening in the ceiling. We had to be standing in just the right place. We had to find the right spot on the ceiling. The ceiling in this place was a wood ceiling. I don't know if we were looking for something. Someone said something about us going there to get our share. After it lifted us through we would keep entering these different rooms. In each room we had to find the thing that would let us through into the next place. When I say through I mean we would put these two things together with our arms stretched above us and it would pull us through this place in the wall. Some of them were decorated with Christmas stuff. I always had a more difficult time getting through those. I finally said to someone, about the third time, it was a Christmas thing, and I had trouble getting through. It was almost as though I was trying to break through a clear, rubbery substance. It looked like a regular Christmas display but when I tried to go through it would be very rubbery and difficult to break through. After the third time I said, All three times it was Christmas that I had difficulty getting through. I guess that tells me I still haven't worked through my Christmas issues. I've had a dream like this before, where I was going through these different rooms and breaking through these different scenes in a similar fashion. It seemed that to start this whole journey, or travel, or whatever, we had to take a bunch of pills that were various colors, sizes, and shapes. We were in this drug store or something and I worked there but then someone else that I worked for at another place came in and I couldn't let him see that I worked there. It would have made him mad. So I ducked behind the pharmacy counter and was trying to hide. But the owner that I worked for here was a pharmacist and was working back there. I finally had to say, I'll explain in a minute. As I was ducking down. I ducked down kind of in front of her and was trying to hide because this other person, I think it was a man came looking behind the counter. As he did so the pharmacist opened her pharmacy jacket enough to hide me further from his view so he didn't see me. After he left I said, I'm sorry. I work there too but he can't know that I also work here because it would make him mad. So she handed me a prescription and said, well, here. Just take care of this. I didn't want her to know that I was getting ready to leave to do this other thing - whatever it was. So I took the prescription and walked away."
"0592"	"(2003-05-19)"	"I was at my birth home. I was standing at the kitchen window looking out. A car pulled up and turned into the driveway across the road. It used to be the driveway to Alig's house but their house was no longer there. The driveway was now flat and led back into the woods. There was a sign at the entrance of the driveway that faced the road and said Old Country Store. There was a log fence along the drive. I told Mother that I didn't realize that Alig's house was no longer there and that someone had put in that store. I was now in a car with Bill C and someone else. They wanted to see this country store so we were driving back the long driveway. I had the impression that they were expecting something like a Country General Store. I told them to keep in mind that we were in St. Joe and they shouldn't expect the typical in St. Joe. They dismissed me saying something to the effect that I shouldn't be critical. We got back to the store and walked in. There were two rooms to the store, a front room and a back room. There was a woman, perhaps my age or younger, or owned and operated the store. The front room was nothing but candles. We entered the back room and it was nothing but more candles. We came back from the front room and Bill C and the other person with us was somewhat incredulous that it was a candle store. I wanted to tell them that I warned them but I didn't. I was standing looking out a window of the store. There was a woman with long black hair lying on her back in the gravel playing with her dog. I mentioned this to Bill C. As we walked out of the store she moved over into the grass. I thought I recognized her. As we were pulling away in the car I realized it was Georgia D from high school."
"0593"	"(2003-05-26)"	"I was living at the house on Lakeland Dr. I was in CI with some of my CRHP sisters. We were at an event. I had put together a video. At lunchtime we were eating some soup I had made. I had gotten the recipe from a previous CRHP group, from a book or video they had put together. Everyone loved the soup. I said one of the reasons I liked it so much is that it reminded me of summer. It had sliced bananas, kiwis, and other fruits in it. Maybe it was a cold soup. It was very pretty. As we were talking about this soup I realized that I had neglected to give appropriate credit for the recipe in the video and that I would have to edit for that. I went in to the house of the woman who was duplicating the video. I wondered why someone outside of our CRHP group was duplicating it. I realized I was going to have to edit the master video and then the ones that she had already duplicated. I went back to my house for some reason. I was walking. When I got to my street there were large boxes scattered around the street about midway to my house. When I got closer to them I realized they were all for me. I choose one that was nearest to the middle of the street and drug it to the sidewalk and then drug it the rest of the way home along the sidewalk. Once or twice I veered off the sidewalk and then got back on it. When I got to my driveway I noticed rows of grass growing up through the cement driveway. I drug the box up the driveway and just then realized that I left my keys back at CI. I would have to walk all the way back to get my keys. I realized it would take me about 15 minutes. Now there were two of my CRHP sisters there. They were going that way too but they were going to run. I had a plastic tumbler with something to drink in it. I was finishing my drink and telling them to wait for me, that I would run with them. As we began to run I was finishing my drink and telling them that I wouldn't be able to keep up because I'm not a runner, but I was going to try anyway."
"0594"	"(2003-05-27)"	"I was on the TV show The West Wing, but we were actually in the White House. We all believed we were actually the White House staff. It was the holidays and we were sitting in a room that had tables and chairs but it wasn't a meeting room, kitchen, or dining room. We were sitting at tables and chairs and we were all getting ready to leave to go on various trips to various places. Maybe we were headed home for the Holidays. Donna brought out two very large suitcases. CJ was teasing her or something about her suitcases. Donna got very defensive. CJ said, the thing that really gets me is the security tags on the luggage. Donna said something to the effect of these days you can't be too careful or something about the hassle of traveling by air these days. I don't know what these security tags were or what their purpose was. The one suitcase in particular, the largest one, was lying on its side and she had a coat laying on it. The President was coming down a wide, white set of stairs. He was wearing a white suit. He started running down the steps and fell. He ended up sliding down the rest of the steps on the seat of his pants. He was laughing. He bumped his nose so he was holding his nose. When he hit the bottom of the steps he started running. Someone was kind of chasing after him. They were just playing around. Someone had said some kind of nursery rhyme about first one to the buffet. Then they said something to him about running and sliding down the steps that way. He said, I can't help myself. Whenever I hear that rhyme, and he repeated it, I just have to be the first one to the buffet. A bunch of us were sitting together, again at tables but in a different place. CJ and Toby were sitting across from each other. CJ was bemoaning the fact that she wasn't in a relationship. Toby kind of started flirting with her. They went back and forth a bit. Then they stood up and each leaned across the table. They were going to kiss. I don' t know if they actually did. As I was sitting there listening to this and observing I was thinking, Why her? Why not me? Why is it never me?"
"0595"	"(2003-05-30)"	"I was working at the CAS office. We had a special event going on, but I'm not sure where we were holding it. Bill C had hired three more people. One was a woman around my age. She had black hair and was about the same size and height as me. Another was a woman, probably in her early 20's, with shoulder-length black hair, thin and very pretty. The other was a man in his early 20's, somewhat short, thin, with dark hair. The young woman was in front of the group with another woman, speaking to the audience. It wasn't until later that she was working for CAS. I was sitting in the audience with the other woman. Later, the four of us are sitting together in the audience, talking. I was thinking about how great it was that I was getting along so well with these two women. The young man I could tell was going to be a troublemaker. He was sharing Bill C's office space and he felt that gave him a distinct advantage over the rest of us. He kept saying he felt bad for us that Bill C was giving him such special treatment, asking him to do certain things rather than asking the rest of us, just because he was working in that space. I patted him on the knee and said, trust me. I've had my turn being the office lackey. The things he was referring to were the kinds of things an office lackey would do. He made some comment to insinuate that I misunderstood or didn't know what I was talking about. I am looking out a window. There is a clown or some such person out there with some fireworks. He waves to a child standing inside to come out and join him. The child goes out and takes a lit firework item from the clown and throws it into a moving limousine. I was concerned for two reasons. One is that it was dangerous but the other that I thought the limousine was carrying some of our clients coming to our program. It turned out that Santa Claus and some other people were in the limousine. They all jumped out and were running around yelling. Santa's beard was on fire. I seemed more concerned about how setting Santa's beard on fire would affect this child."
"0596"	"(2003-05-29)"	"I was in this town but I don't know what for. I was trying to drive home. I wasn't sure how to get back. It was kind of like a city. As I was driving through the city streets it was mid to late afternoon. The children were just getting out of school and they were all walking in the lanes of the streets. This was accepted practice. The cars had to just follow slowly behind them. There was one group of children that had a teacher walking with them. On one street there was one child walking alone and I had to just drive slowly behind her. I finally turned into this one place. I was going to stop and ask for directions. As I turned it took me down a spiral, like the spiral ramp at the airport. It spiraled down, and down, and down. I finally got to the bottom. I got out of my car. There wasn't a parking lot. I don't know what happened to the car. I realized that I was at a mall. I saw these two figures. It looked like projections of people, but the outlines of the body were primarily surrounded by something that looked like Christmas lights but the figures were talking to people who were there visiting the mall. I just stood there for a minute. I wasn't sure where to go or what to do. I turned for a minute, I was going to talk to them and then I decided against it, that I didn't want to. I turned away and then one of the figures addressed me. So I finally said, I'm lost. I came in looking for directions to try to help me find my way back home. This one figure moved towards me and as she did she became a regular person. She said she would walk with me and show me how to get home. So, we walked to a couple of different areas and we finally walked to this elevator bay. Somebody came by and had what looked like a red sale tag, about 3 x 6 inches, with white lettering. It said something about CAS and BCB. She brought it along and she was rubbing it against something along the walls of the elevator bay. I said to this woman who was going to show me the way, She has our price tag. The woman I was with said, Oh, you know them? I said, That's the company I work for. She said, Really? Then the elevator opened and she stepped in and it started to close very quickly, before I could get in. So she grabbed the door and opened it and I stepped in but it was only wide enough for you to stand with your back against the wall and the door closed and maybe 3-4 people could have gotten in and stood that way inside the elevator. Anyway, as the elevator closed she said, So you work for Bill C? That tall handsome man? I chuckled and said, Yes. She said, do you spend much time with him? I said, well, yes. She said something about him doing training and I said yes he does alot of training and there was something about him using the whiteboard. I said, He loves to use the whiteboard. He uses it constantly. She said, Oh. So you stand there and watch him use the whiteboard. I thought this was very odd but said yes. She said, He's facing the whiteboard so you have a rear view of him all the time. I suddenly realized what she was getting at. She said, does he really have such a good body? Again I chuckled and just said something like, it's a nice view. I thought it was all kind of silly. The elevator finally started and it was very fast and it just seemed to go down, and down, and down. We finally got out of the elevator and got into another one and we did the same thing. We did this several times. As we were doing this I was starting to wonder if I was in a parallel universe. I don't know why I thought this. The elevators, the whole environment, was very odd looking. When I was in the mall it was like this huge open space and everything was white. I didn't actually see any stores. When we went to the elevator bays, they were like this huge white open space, with big white round pillars. The doors of the elevators reminded me of gold glitter. Instead of just flat doors, I wish I knew how to explain this, kind of like different levels to the door . I don't know how to explain it. We finally got off the elevator and there were two men there. She asked one of them to take me the rest of the way. So she left me with him. I don't know if we got back on the elevators or not. We finally left this building and walked back outside. At one place it looked maybe like there was snow on the ground but it wasn't cold or wet or anything. This one place there were different animals running around. One was maybe a bull. We stayed out of the way but we weren't afraid of him or anything. It's as though I am observing this man with another woman. They were almost buried under this white stuff. I'm having trouble describing what this is. I think he became infatuated with this woman. It seemed that he was someone who could easily cross over between the two worlds, the two universes or whatever it was. And she wasn't. And he was bringing her into this universe, I guess, where I live in waking life. One or two times he picked her up and carried her. Somebody else said something to him about how to treat her if he really wanted to get her to fall for him."
"0597"	"(2003-05-29)"	"I found out that Matthew and Ashley B were back together, dating. I was extremely upset by this."
"0598"	"(2003-06-23)"	"I was at Larry K and Sue K's house. There were some other members of the family there. Larry came in. I asked him how I was doing. He said something like okay or something that I could tell that something wasn't quite right. So I questioned him further. He said that he had just gotten back from he said something about his first wife had taken him. He was going to have to pay his first wife $750,000 and then there was something else but I don't know what. He was obviously pretty distraught by this. I was talking to him about the power of the mind to create a reality. Then we also started rearranging the furniture in his bedroom so it would be more Feng Shui. His bedroom looked more like a hotel room. There was a door leading outside. One of the things we did was turn the bed around so that the foot of the bed was closest to the door leading outside but we also sitting kind of in the middle of the room. I think there was also a baby grand piano in this room. I was trying to remember where the appropriate place was for that, according to good Feng Shui. Then I remembered that I had something at home that I felt would be perfect in this room. So I was going to go get it. I went outside and I had this all wood, kind of like a wood chair. It was straight back. Wood seat. Nothing special to it. This was going to be my transportation. I thought I could get home pretty quickly this way. I'll just decide to go really fast instead of just sitting in the chair the regular way I straddled the back and kind of tipped back on the back two legs and started going. It was just as though I willed it to start moving and it did as though it had a motor and wheels. I went up into the air, thinking that would be quicker because I wouldn't have to follow the roads that way. I was flying through some trees that I normally would have been ducking and trying to get around the branches, but I just went straight through with no problem. Then I wanted to turn to the right and get back on the road at one point but I couldn't do it as fast as I was going so I decided to go to the left and see if I could do it that way and get on the road straight without slowing down. Then the next thing I know I'm on something  that acted like a ferry to take us across water except that it didn't look like that at all. It wasn't nearly that big and there was just something that was just flat and floating on the water that was taking across the water toward the other side or the next road. There were other people on it. There was a man with two young boys and they had a bunch of what looked like camping gear. I was talking to them a little bit and when we got to the other side of this water I was helping them unload. It's as though I totally forgot about Larry at this point. I was helping them to unload and set up and it turns out that it seems that maybe that man's wife, the little boy's mother, had died. They had owned a business there and they had decided, I guess the man decided it was time to go back and try to get the business going again."

"0601"	"(2003-07-06)"	"Part of this was me trying to explain to someone that I needed a cool-air humidifier for my throat and that all I have is a hot-air humidifier. There was also something about going to a furniture store. It always related to trying to explain to someone that I needed a cool-mist humidifier rather than a warm-mist humidifier and trying to figure out how to get one."
"0602"	"(2003-07-07)"	"There was some kind of a gathering at my house. All my CRHP sisters were there and some dream clients. Rosie F from grade school was there. At least Mark M was there. I said do you really think you can help me with that? As we were standing there Mark was about to have an OBE. I was tugging on his arm saying, No Mark. Don't go. Don't go. The first time he kind of struggled and it was as though he was talking to someone about the experience he was having, telling them that I wouldn't let him go. That I didn't let him go. So he stayed but then the next time he was really fighting me mentally, willfully fighting me. I was pulling on his arm, by his elbow, saying, No Mark. Don't Go! Don't Go! But he went anyway. His body went limp. Myself and someone else sat his body on a sofa and I didn't know what to do. I was so scared and his eyes seemed to be open and he just stayed OB for a long time. After a while had passed I asked if everyone knew what to do or how to bring him back because he wasn't coming back. So finally someone else agreed with me that it might be a good idea to call Father Jerry. I guess he happened to be there because he walked in. He said, Yes. We need to pray. We called everyone into the room and asked them to form a circle, hold hands, and to pray for Mark - that he return to his body. Father Jerry didn't want to hold Mark's hand. Mark was to Father Jerry's right. I was going to go over and hold hand's with Father Jerry and hold Mark's hand. When I went over I ended up standing to Mark's right. I don't remember how that happened. Maybe someone else stepped in between Father Jerry and Mark. We said a prayer but it didn't help. The prayer didn't help. Mark was still OBE. More and more time passed and I was becoming very concerned and frightened. People were starting to leave. I didn't want them to leave and be alone in the house with him and not know what to do. Josie F. was there with someone else I knew - maybe a CRHP sister. I told her I was surprised and delighted to see her. She and the other person had their backs to the coffee table. The coffee table had a bunch of papers on it. It seems they were some kind of invitations I had sent out - to this event and to another event as well. Aunt P was also there. She was getting ready to leave but wanted to take her invitation with her. There were three identical ones lying there but she wanted to make sure she got her own. It seems there were two pieces of paper to each invitation. One was a floral paper in rose tones. The other was a kind of white frosted parchment type paper, like we use at CAS for licensing. She finally picked up the bottom of the three invitations and prepared to leave. We were at my home but it was different than my waking life home. She was going to leave through the back - maybe the kitchen. There were two doors at the corner in the right left of the room. One on each wall. She started to open the door on the back wall and I said, No. It's this door, meaning the one on the left wall. I opened it for her and she left. I am preparing to go outside but I know or see that there are two very large dogs out there so I am afraid to go out. They are blonde colored dogs with different shades of color on various parts of their bodies. I have decided to go try to find Mark's wife and tell her the bad news. I think I have decided that he is not coming back into his body - either willfully or because he can't. I have to somehow go past these dogs to be able to get to her. I finally decide to go ahead and go through - they are in a garage or some such area. Luckily they are sleeping and I manage to slip by them without waking them up. I think I may have woken one of them but it didn't catch me before I got to the other door. The other door seemed to lead into another home. Mark's wife was there and wanted to know who I was and what I was doing there. I introduced myself. I don't remember telling her why I was there but the next thing I knew we decided that if we go back to where Mark's body is sitting and we talk to him about their coming baby that he would somehow hear us and come back into his body. His wife raised her blouse and was rubbing her nipples. I think her and I were kind of singing something about their baby while she was doing this to get him to come back. It seemed that there were blue and purple colors on her nipples and the colors seemed to change as she rubbed them. We slowly saw Mark coming back into his body."
"0603"	"(2003-07-07)"	"I went to the CAS office and Bill C had given my office to someone else. There was another woman working there. "
"0604"	"(2003-07-12)"	"It started out that I went to the YMCA. When I went back to the locker room all the different stalls were changing clothes. I was having trouble finding an empty one. There were three women in there that were getting married that day. They were using the Y to get dressed. One in particular had this big poofy dress that was lying on the floor so it was in this big circle. Right in the center there was a little open space where she would step into it. There wasn't much room to stand so I stood in that space waiting for a place to change. There were a bunch of women standing around waiting. Then someone handed us these little paper things that we could help these brides with while we were standing there waiting. They were little things that were maybe 1.5 x 5 inches. When I write it out it almost looks like the shape of my small cutting board, but it had an adhesive backing and we were pulling these off. One woman put the handle-like part in her mouth and blew on it as though we were supposed to blow them up. But we were standing there tearing the backs off for them. I would peel them off and stick one on each finger and then I would reach over to hand them to someone else. Then she would take them all and just put them in piles on top of each other. I wondered how they were going to be able to get them apart. The woman who was doing it didn't seem to think it was going to be a problem. I stepped out to the outside of this dress. I was going to step back in and I said, let me find my foot hole here. I stepped back in. Someone with one of the brides came out and got the dress and was helping her put it on and actually someone I think was helping the other brides as well. They got dressed. Now they were going to start the ceremony. It turns out that all three of them were getting married in the same ceremony, though none of them knew each other. I was standing at the front of this I was no longer in the locker room. I saw Cole P. I said, Hi Cole P. He put one hand on his stomach, leaned over a little bit and laughed and he said, I'm still Bernie Stout. I thought to myself, What is that about? Was his name really not Cole P? Why would he change his name or go by another name? Then I was afraid to say anything else to him because I didn't know that he had another name and I didn't know if I should say anything about it or just ignore it or what I should do. So then we're standing in this big room, but behind a curtain partition. We could see on the other side of this curtain that people were taking their seats for the wedding. There were some bridesmaids standing at the front. They had on black jackets that had gold lame threads running through the fabric. These bridesmaids had on dresses with a maroon color to it. Sitting in the front row is a woman who is dressed like the bridesmaids but her other color was gold or silver. She was sitting with some other people. I thought that was pretty unusual that one of them would be sitting there with the rest of the people while the rest of the bridesmaids were up front. Then I found out that these weddings were kind of a new way to get married and they had kind of a comical twist to it. It seems that the first bride just walked in. The next one, someone was helping her in. The third one I think maybe someone was carrying her. Maybe the second one was being carried and the third one walked. I don't remember now. Then I realized that this is a business of Cole P's. That he sells these wedding packages to people and it's always two weddings at a time. I have these forms where we were selling CAS books and products. I had gone to this place to drop off these forms so people there could order our books and stuff. There were alot of supplier people there. Apparently they host a breakfast or something for suppliers. They didn't have any breakfast. A number of different people were there. When you came in you had to take off your shoes. There was a place outside to put your shoes. There was a large square platform. Different parts of the platform had things written on it. One part said, Business Professional People or something like that. So one woman came and said, Why don't you put my shoes and put them in the professional section? So I took my shoes off, I realized I hadn't taken them off yet. I went out and put mine there as well, though there were already several pair of shoes there so I was trying not to set mine on top of someone else's. I was trying to find a clear space where I could set mine and I did. After these three weddings were over, somehow it was very odd. Then I was going to take these forms back to Cole P. There was someone that I think worked for him in the car with me. His business was in BR. I went there. I almost have the feeling that I went there and I parked and then I left and then went again, this time was when that employee was with me. I was going to park the same place and she pointed out that wherever I was. When I was getting ready to leave from wherever I was the first time to take these to Cole P's place of business, this woman was with me. We started backing up and I told her where I was going and she said, Oh. You mean the office right next to where you were. I said I didn't even realize that's where it was. So I was just going to pull back into the same parking space. She said, No. It would be better if you parked over here. She directed me to 3/4 way around the block to park. I thought it was quite a little ways to walk. I didn't mind the walk but I wondered why I had to drive so far away when I could have just parked in the same spot, and right next to the door. I just went ahead and did it. I took the forms in and there were these bags that had forms in them. They were on shelves, kind of high up so I was kind of standing on my tiptoes trying to see the right place to put my forms. Cole P came out and we were chatting for a little bit and another person comes in or sticks his head in the door. He says something about the business. Cole P says, Well. We've gone to three now. Meaning that instead of just two weddings at a time they do three. So we're talking and he said, Great! Sign me up. I was surprised at how popular this was. Apparently Cole P was just almost booked solid with this service he was selling. As part of the package he provided all of the wedding details too. But still I was surprised and so as we continued to chat he said something to somebody about the double edge, referring to two weddings at once. Then after he told this other man that he went to three, and that man left, I said, So now it's the triple edge. There was also something about us deciding to offer some kind of wedding gift. It seemed more as though our gift was going to be something to do rather than a typical wedding gift. I was spending I was also going to have to redo the forms to include something about this wedding gift that they were going to receive."
"0605"	"(2003-07-13)"	"I was trying to fix something out in the backyard. It had something to do with water. When I did it, it actually created a worse problem and it looked like a mini-Niagara falls in two different places. They weren't very high but very wide. The water was just gushing out like you would see at a water fall like that. BJ was at the house and I said, Quick we need to go call maintenance and get them over here right away. Then later I thought I should have just found where to turn the water source off inside and do that until maintenance got there to fix whatever it was that I did."
"0606"	"(2003-07-13)"	"I was on a business trip with Bill C. We were in a hotel room. Actually I was there and Bill C came in. The room had two double beds. I was going to sleep in one and he was going to sleep in the other. It was in my head that this was just the way we always did it. We were talking about related to business as he was getting ready for bed. After he was ready for bed he came to my bed and started to climb in. I was lying where he was trying to get in. He said, What do you mean what am I doing? You know what I'm doing. I didn't. I went ahead and moved over and he got into bed with me. He kissed me. I was thinking that he wasn't a bad kisser and then I thought he could move a little more but still not bad. At some point Bill C became Daniel R. Now I was on a bus and Daniel R got on the bus and at first, even though there was an empty seat next to me, he took a seat a couple rows back. This was a very short bus. Not a typical bus. Maybe only 5 or 6 rows of seats. There were 3 seats on one side of the aisle and maybe 2-3 on the other side of the aisle. I got up and went back and sat next to him. I put my hand through his arm, at his elbow. We were talking and he was kind of upset about something, not upset at me. He got up and moved into another seat then. I thought I would just let him go. This bus had alot of black people on it. In fact, I think Daniel R and I were the only white people on the bus. I turned around a couple of times. I finally asked one of them if the white man was asleep. They said yes. We pulled up. I guess he woke up and got up and came and sat next to me again. We pulled up to this place where we were getting off. We got off and we were walking together and again I had my hand in his elbow, holding on at his elbow. It continues to be something about finding the document or something on the computer. I don't know what computer we're using since we are on the road traveling. Something continues about or related to him kissing me and related to the fact that my shoulder was bothering me."
"0607"	"(2003-07-15)"	"I was traveling with my brother and one sister [not my brother and sister in waking life] . We stopped and checked into a hotel. I think we checked into two or three separate rooms. We were going there to visit another sister who was having some kind of a party. We checked into our hotel rooms and then we went to see this other sister. It was apparently going to be kind of a wild party and they were smoking marijuana. I hung around for a little bit and then I went outside. I was really struggling with the fact that they were smoking marijuana. I finally decided that I had to be true to myself and I just couldn't stay since they were doing that. I went and told her and she got upset and she thought I was being a snob. I said, You know, it's up to you what you do. But I have to be true to myself and I can't stay here when things like that are going on. I just can't. I just can't be a part of that. My one sister, it seems that it was Betty B, was disappointed because she really wanted to party. She just decided to stay. I went and told my brother that I was leaving and he said, Good. He also didn't want to stay for the same reason. We went to our hotel rooms and got our stuff together. We went to the front desk and there were alot of people needing assistance at the front desk for various things - mostly checking in. There were two or three different service window areas. They had accordion fold shutters across these windows. They had only one of the windows open and there was no one there. So I walked around and looked in a door that was partially open. I saw a grey-haired gentleman sitting at a desk working. I asked if we could get some help out here at the window. I went back down and other people were starting to line up at the window then. I pushed ahead since I was there first and since I was the one to actually go get help. I thought I deserved to be first in line. Someone else tried to push ahead of me. Then a man and a woman came up to start helping people and the others in line stepped back and told them to take care of me first since I was there first. I handed her my room key and told her that we were checking out. She took my key and walked away. When she came back she was holding up this long piece of paper. She said, You're going to have a good reason since it is before 6 p.m. I told her that the transmission on my car died or something, I wasn't sure what was wrong with it that I just knew it had major problems and I had to go get it fixed. She went ahead and checked me out. I told her that my brother is in another room and he is leaving with me for the same reason, so you know when he comes to check out. There were two men sitting at a table in the lobby. The table was a rectangle shape. One was sitting on a side and the other was sitting on an end. I think that maybe they had a child or two with them. One gentleman was tall and thin and had dark hair. He had kind of a country look, wearing blue jeans and a hat. He said something but I don't know if he was talking to the children or to me. I don't even remember what he said. I went to the room to finish getting my things together. My brother, David [not in waking life] , came in and we were getting the stuff together. We had unmade the bed. We were debating whether we should just make the bed up again. A woman came in and said, This is a mess. We're going to have to charge you something. I said, but we've only been here a little while. How about if we make the bed? David and I started making the bed. He was kind of playing around, making it more difficult. I told him to just slow down and take it easy so we could get it put back together. As we were making the bed there were a bunch of pillows. Not all of them were regular bed pillows. I had taken my body pillow with me so I took that off and put it on the floor. There was a royal blue backpack. It was there with the pillows but it looked like a backpack. There was also a pillow that had a pink seersucker fabric, kind of like my table topper in waking life. I realized that it was our pillow but I decided to just leave it for them because we needed enough pillows to make it look like it did when we checked in. So I used the royal blue backpack as a pillow as well. We made the bed and I asked if that was okay. I was picking up some trash. We had some trash in one of the wastebaskets, so I made sure that all the trash was just in the one wastebasket. We had used two glasses and I went ahead and just left them sitting there. There was something there that looked kind of like a small pitcher but it didn't have a handle on it. It had water in it. I left that sit there. Now there is a little girl with us. She walks up and says something to this woman. I don't remember all of what she said but part of what she said was, I hope you don't hate us. The woman softened and thought, How can I be mad at them with this little girl and her saying that? We went ahead then and I asked David if he was okay to drive, if he would mind driving. He said, No. Not at all. So we left."
"0608"	"(2003-07-15)"	"I was in a car by myself. I couldn't get the brakes to work and the gas pedal seemed to be stuck, maybe the brake pedal as well. I was beginning to get scared because I didn't know how to stop it or slow it down. It seemed to actually pick up speed; it was going pretty fast. I pulled off into this field. I was going to drive around in circles in this field until I figured out what to do. I saw a police officer sitting in a patrol car in the field watching traffic. I thought, He's going to come after me but I don't know what else to do. I went ahead and pulled into the field. Sure enough, the officer turned on his flashing lights and came after me. He pulled up along side of me and looked at me. I said, help me. I can't stop my car. I thought he was going to abandon his car and try to jump onto and into mine so he could help me. Shortly after that I was able to stop the car or it stopped itself. I looked down and saw that the floor mat had been jammed up under the pedals. It had the gas pedal stuck so the car was going fast but it also had the brake pedal stuck so I couldn't press down on it to stop the car. I just fixed the floor mat, started the car back up and then left. The policeman was mad, not because I had left but because he had come so far into the field. I don't know if he got stuck. I don't know. But he was kind of upset."
"0609"	"(2003-07-16)"	"I went on retreat and I was driving a van. I was at the retreat. I think I was with someone else. I had spent the night the night before the retreat. That morning I got up and got ready and took my suitcase with me to the retreat room. It was in another building. The building where we slept was on one side of the parking lot and the building where they held the retreat was on the other so we had to cross the parking lot to get to the area where the retreat was being held. I took my suitcase with me. I put it and my purse in front of the room. At the end of the day, after the retreat was over, I walked out and realized that I didn't have my keys or my purse so I ran back in and grabbed my purse. There were now two purses. I picked them back up and started walking back out. I had said something as I ran back in because I was afraid they were going to lock the door on me. I ran back in and said, I realized that I had forgotten my purse. When I started walking out with two of them they said something to me. I said, I know that's the problem with these small purses. I tried to change them but I was running out of time when I had them half switched and had to leave so I ended up bringing both of them. It's just ridiculous. So I walked out and was putting things in the van. In this white van there were small compartments on the right side. One was just a bit bigger than an average size flashlight. The other was a bit bigger than that, maybe two feet x two feet square. One door on it had to shut before the other. None of them were more than a few inches deep. I don't remember them having handles on them so I don't know how I got them open. I opened the larger one and realized that my suitcase wasn't going to fit in there and that I would have to put it inside the van. I went back to my room. I was going to change my clothes before I headed back. I realized I didn't have my suitcase. I left it in the other building. I had half-changed clothes. I grabbed my keys because I was going to drive across the parking lot because I thought it would be faster, even though it was only a few hundred feet. I was afraid the building would be locked. I was in the lobby of the building where we slept and I heard someone coming down the steps. The steps had dark wood banisters with round carved spindles. It seemed more flat than it did like a staircase. I only saw the flat part that was about one story above me. I didn't actually see the part where he would come down. I waited. I was going to ask them before I went over if they knew what time they lock the doors. It was a man that was at the retreat. He had his luggage with him. I asked him if he knew what time the other building got locked. He said, No. I'm on retreat here like everyone else. He was very rude. I said, Well, I just thought if you had been here on retreat before that you might know. Another man who was on retreat had overheard this. He said, don't let him bother you. I was clearly embarrassed and felt bad. I just said to the other man, I'm very sorry that I bothered you. Then I went outside. It was starting to rain. My van was now a baby bed. One of the wheels was missing. I realized that the wheel was still inside so it would be faster for me to just go over there."
"0610"	"(2003-07-18)"	"I was at the SAID conference attending some workshops. I also presented one. One of the dreams that I shared was the one about being murdered. Later, at another one I was presenting, Sally R was there. At the end she was saying how frustrating it is not to interpret, then she mentioned my dream and some of the images. I said, That's exactly why it's so important not to interpret or to project your interpretations on to someone else. She said, Yeah. I know. But I'd like to know what that's about. I told her that for me, in this case, some of it is about the fact that I have the tendency to murder myself everyday mentally and emotionally and that I'm at risk for doing that because I am very hard on myself. There was also something about conference next year and I was debating about whether or not I was going to be able to go."
"0611"	"(2003-07-18)"	"I was at an SAID conference. We were at a large, very nice hotel. It was getting close to time for the Conference Gala. I had been taking pictures throughout the conference. I offered to take pictures of someone in their costume before they arrived at the ball simply because their costume was such that it would only be fully appreciated in a picture. Someone overheard me make this offer so they asked me to also come to their room and take a picture of them in their costume. So I agreed to do this. I went to her room. Her roommate had described the costume to me as having vines all over her. When I got to her room and saw here costume, I saw that the only vine was on the back in a scallop shape hanging from her shoulders. That was it. Otherwise the outfit was a dressy, white, chiffon, pant and top. She was a woman not much older than I was and very attractive, maybe in her mid to late fifties. Her hotel room was very large. I was looking for the best vantage point to take her picture. Then was one place in the room that had a recessed ceiling light. I suggested she stand right under that light. I thought it would give a very nice effect. I had alot of trouble getting her in the right position. She didn't seem to understand my directions or she would decide on her own to move. I was having trouble getting shots that didn't have hotel furniture like the bed in the shot. I took a couple of pictures and then I stepped outside her room. There was a beautiful courtyard. One wall had alot of beautiful dark wood. There was alot of green. The floors were a beautiful green. I don't know if it was flooring or grass. I said, Let's take some out here. This would be beautiful. We went out there. I got very close and got ready to take a shot. I looked away and looked back and saw that she had moved very far away from the camera. I said, Why did you do that? Why did you move far away? She said, Because I told you I want some full body shots. I said, Yes. But as far away as you moved you will be about this big in the picture. I held up my hand and my thumb and forefinger were about an inch apart. I said, I don't think that's what you want. You can't hardly see that you're there. She kind of shrugged her shoulders and nodded her head yes, that she understood. I repositioned her up close. I said, Now, I'm only going to take one or two more because I'm running out of film. So this is going to be it. As I was taking those pictures I saw her soon to be ex-husband and daughter walking up behind her. I quickly snapped two or three pictures. I knew they weren't getting along well with the separation and upcoming divorce. It was her idea not his and he was not happy about it. I thought he would appreciate these pictures with all three of them in the picture. After I finished I caught up with him. They were on their way to the dream ball. We were going through these different areas of the hotel and up these steps. I caught up with him. I said, Mike. Mike. Wait. I was just taking some pictures of your wife and she doesn't realize it but I got some pictures with you and your daughter in them too. We were going up some steps as I said this and I was a couple of steps behind him. He turned half way around and said, If you're not careful you're going to be ticking Mike off too. "
"0612"	"(2003-07-19)"	"I was working at the CAS office and we hired a secretarial person. She was an older woman. Our office was in a house. It reminded me of my birth home. Her office was in the living room. I didn't spend a lot of time training her that day. I was very busy. That wasn't a good excuse but I just didn't spend a lot of time training her that day. That evening after everyone else left, I called Jeff K to ask him about something. He said it sounded as though we need to meet. I said, Okay. When? He said, Well. If you have the time now I'll just come over now. He came over and we started talking and working. I said something about advertising. I guess he realized that we weren't doing what he thought we were doing and he said, well, this is just useless. So he started packing up his stuff and getting ready to leave. I said, Now wait. Wait. Let's take care of this. He said, Oh. It's just useless. He said, well, we'll have to do something else. Let me go back and work on this. I walked him to the door through the kitchen and out the back door to the breezeway. He put on his jacket and I saw him lean over and move something that looked like a white tarp, as though he were uncovering something. He picked up a bike. I think he was embarrassed or something to have me see that he came over there on a bike. He said, excuse me. He pulled the bike across the front of me, running over my toe. I didn't say anything. I said, How close to here do you live? He said, I don't know that I told you that I moved not very long ago. I said, Yes. But how close do you live? He never did answer me. I was watching him. He was doing something to the bike, like adjusting the seat or maybe it was one of those bikes with hinges that you can fold up and he was unfolding it. I was thinking that this was a very nice and very expensive bike. It was dark outside already. I was concerned that he was going to be riding his bike in the dark. I didn't people in cars would see him. He just got on his bike and started riding away. I said, Jeff K. That's dangerous. They can't see you. You don't have anything reflective on. He just kept riding. I watched him ride down the driveway and turn right onto the rode. His jacket glowed in the dark a little so I could see him a little bit. After he got down the rode just a little ways he turned around and came back. I said, well, it's better than I thought. But it's still dangerous. He stopped further down on the sidewalk. He asked me something about how satisfied we are with his work. I couldn't understand because he was too far away. I said, Jeff K, come up here closer. I can't hear you. He said, No, Anna. Just answer the question. I said, Jeff K, I have a severe hearing loss. I really can't hear you. I heard him say something like, she can hear me . He turned around and rode off again. I got mad. I went inside and kind of slammed the door behind me. As I went in I realized that all of the cabinet doors were now standing open. At first I just started closing them. Then I realized that they weren't open when Jeff K and I left. I got really scared because I realized this meant that someone was in there. I just turned around and darted back out to the breezeway. I was just going to get out of there. As I got out to the breezeway Jeff K had come back again. I was so glad. I said, Jeff K. Someone is in there. I know someone is in there because all the cabinet doors were open when I went back in and they weren't when you and I came out earlier. I think he was going to go in. I didn't want him to because I was afraid for him. I didn't want him to get hurt either. I didn't know who was in there or what they were doing or what they might do to us."

I wondered if it would be too difficult for her, strengthening the cheek muscles and such for playing a wind instrument, because of her age. I don't know why it would be. I thought that maybe if she had a saxophone I could relearn how to play the clarinet and we could practice together every day."
"0614"	"(2003-07-19)"	"I went to see Tony S and Dorothy S. Their house was in a fairly isolated area. I didn't see any other houses around. There wasn't a lot of grass either. I pulled up next to a very small dry creek bed. There were a couple of other cars there. On the other side of my car there was a wood slat fence. I can't think what you call it now, where the wood planks run horizontal and there are three or four per section of fence. I went inside the house. We were talking a little bit. We were lying down, watching TV and talking. I think twice I said how good it is to see her again. I told myself that I was glad that I paid attention to the messages telling me that I needed to go see her again. That I needed to mend fences, so to speak. As we were lying there I think she asked me about where I'm working now. I told her about the story behind my new business name. One of the drafts of my brochures were laying there so I got up and picked one up and handed it to her. She said something that irritated me and made me think that this is why I hadn't been back to see her in so long. I don't remember now what she said. I think we were supposed to go have lunch together. I was thinking that we should get up and go have lunch. We did get up. I thought we were getting ready to go and then her mother came in. She said to me, well, we need to get back to work now. It was very good seeing you. I thought, What's going on? Miscommunication or something? Her young boys were there, in waking life she has girls. So her and her mom went ahead and left and I was still there with the boys. There was a large plastic container sitting there on a stool. It was full of snacks. I was thinking that she has it there so it is easy for the children to get snacks when they want them and her or Tony S aren't there. I was thinking about the fact that it is always sitting there on that stool. It has been for as many years as I can remember. I was thinking about the fact that that is very comfortable for her and Tony S but I could never do that. I would always want it put away someplace. I opened the container and there were some diet potato chips that were already open. I opened the bag and took a few out and then put the bag back in. I saw Dorothy S was headed back in towards the house so I hurried and put the bag back. I didn't want her to see that I had taken some chips, even though I think she had invited me to have something. I don't know why I didn't want her to know that I did take some chips. I was also holding some books, notepad, or something. I had the chips lying on there and was trying to hide them. I was now outside, headed to my car to go home. When I went outside I was disoriented as far as where I had parked my car. It wasn't where I thought I had parked it. I was trying to figure out where my car was. I saw a creek bed and I knew that I had parked by a creek bed. So I went over there and started walking along it. It went into a very hilly, rocky area. I knew I didn't walk through anything like that when I parked and went in to the house. As I was standing there some people came through the rocky, hilly area. They were just out hiking. I turned around and headed back in the direction that I came from. Dorothy S was there again saying something about I guess she was trying to help me figure out where I was parked."

I'm afraid it's going to get knocked off so I take it and put it inside the cabinet. I also take a salt shaker that has salt in it and I sprinkle salt on top of some things that aren't edible. There is a very large flower sitting on the floor at the corner of the walls that connect the dining room and living room. It has lots of green leaves and deep purple flowers. The flower reminds me of my clematis but the plant is much bushier, larger, and darker green than clematis. I had my candle lighter to light a candle with."
"0617"	"(2003-07-20)"	"I was at the SAID conference. There was going to be a parade. I was headed to the place where I was going to help create a float. I was wondering where everyone else, where all the other groups or organizations were creating their floats. The people who were showing up later to work on our float didn't even know what the people who started it intended for it to be. Then we were having a race in a swimming pool. We weren't swimming. We were in small rafts about the size of an inner tube because our legs hung over the edge. There was a brass bar all around the inside edge of the pool. When they told us to go I used that bar to help propel me around the pool and stay in the front of everyone. I came in third in my group - they had divided everyone into groups and then the winner from each group was to do the final race. Well, I thought I came in third but when I got out and went to stand in third place they told me I came in fifth. I still knew that I was going to have to compete again because they were going to take the top five of each group to race again. But they didn't. We now have our clothes on and are dressed up. Like most of the other women I had on heels. They told us to line up along the edge of the pool, facing the water. There were too many of us - we extended beyond the end of the pool. So they told some of us to stand on the ledge right inside the edge of the pool. I was one that had to do that. I was very nervous about doing this because of my heels and because the ledge wasn't as wide as my feet were long. I was afraid I was going to fall in so I had my feet angled a bit. I was thinking about the shoes that I was wearing. It seems that I always wear the same pair. I have another pair at home that would have gone very well with my clothes. I thought I should have worn those. I know that Samuel K was there. He was saying something about how to do this more successfully."
"0618"	"(2003-07-21)"	"Lee and the FD. My family owned the FD, the place that I worked when I was in high school. I had just arrived. Everyone else was there already and had started eating dinner. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were there as well. I went back to the kitchen to fix myself something. One of the freezer's was standing partially open, there was too much food in it and the door wouldn't close all the way. Some of the others were eating fried chicken that looked good so I decided to fix that for myself. There were two deep fryers, one above the other. The top one was used only for French Fries and there were French Fries in the basket and some just floating in the fryer. I noticed that because the only time fries should have been in the basket is if they were frying, and there shouldn't have been any floating loose in the fryer. The pieces of chicken were very small so I put two in the bottom fryer - one leg and one other piece. There wasn't very much oil in there so I couldn't completely submerse the chicken. I hoped they would cook completely anyway. I put the rest of the bag of chicken back in the freezer. When I did I realized that the only reason the door wouldn't close all the way earlier is because of the way some one had put this bag in there. It closed fine now. I saw that my chicken was cooking very slowly so I looked at the temperature controls and noticed that they were both turned way down. I tried to turn my up but wasn't being successful. I stuck my head out into the dining room and asked someone if they knew what I was doing wrong. Lee, my boyfriend only, came back to help. He looked like the young actor I've seen on TV on the show Crossing Jordan. The one interested in Jordan. He said he knew how to adjust it. There were two dials that you need to adjust. He took care of it for me, gave me a light kiss on the lips as he put his hand on my arm and then went back into the dining room. I don't know where we are but we have luggage with us. We were going somewhere but I don't know where. I know that my older brother and Lee were both with me. I think we are at an airport. When we arrived there Lee was going to go talk to someone or do something. He wanted to check with me first and make sure I didn't mind and that I would be okay. I said, sure. We kissed a couple of times, briefly. Again, as he put his hands on my arms. He told me I was the best. I was thinking that it was nice to be in a relationship with such complete mutual trust and affection. I was thinking how fortunate I was. Bob F and I were sitting at a table. I had some of my coins lying on the table in front of us. When I picked them up to put them in my wallet I realized that there were these other things there as well that looked kind of like coins, maybe more like mashed bottle caps but they were very shiny and gold and silver just like coins. They each said something on them though, in larger print than you would see on a coin. I started sorting them out from my coins to put them back on the table. Bob F said something about Bill F. I said, Yes. Bill F probably would like these. I was thinking about the fact that while I only pick up and save coins that I find on the street, Bill F picks up and saves anything even remotely looking like a coin - game tokens, etc. So I decided to keep these things and give them to Bill F. Bob F and I had taken our things and we were in a very large elevator, kind of like a freight elevator. There were other people in there as well. I noticed something about these people but now I can't recall what. They were doing something to delay us or something and I was trying not to be irritated or annoyed by it."
"0619"	"(2003-07-25)"	"The old music group The Monkees wanted to make a comeback. Someone was trying unsuccessfully to help them. I made some suggestions that fell on deaf ears. The band members had mixed emotions about the comeback. Micky Dolenz was the one that wanted it most. Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith were easily able to let it go. I don't remember hearing Davey Jones' feelings about it. Mickey wanted the comeback very badly and was very upset that it wasn't working out. I got a call from an agent or some such person in California. She wanted to come meet with them. Someone had suggested that she meet Mickey in BR near the train station. I called her and asked if she would be staying in town and she said that she would be returning to CA on the same day. I then suggested that they just meet at the airport. It would be easier for everyone and save her time. She said that was a good idea. She gave me her flight information, airline and flight number, and told me to have him meet her at baggage claim. After I finished speaking with her I realized that I did not get her flight number nor did I make arrangements for how they would find each other. Then I realized that she might know what Mickey looks like from past TV programs and albums. I called Mickey and shared the good news. I told him he could get online and look up her flight to see what time it arrives. Since she is leaving the same day I thought it was odd that she would want to meet at baggage claim. I have the sense that she was going to have baggage with her but I don't know why she would. I was at the airport and met her. I was sitting and chatting with her and employees from the airline came up and spoke with her. They obviously knew each other. I summized that she used to work for the airline. We went to sit in a different place in the airport, at a small round table. A gentleman came up to bring us something and he knew this woman also. They were old friends. He was tall, average build, brown hair but balding, and wore glasses. He had on a white shirt. He worked there, maybe at a restaurant at the airport. As we sat there we were watching this large crowd of people, mostly women, yelling and screaming. It turns out they were watching the Monkees perform. I said to this woman, see how much they love them? She nodded her head yes. I don't know if this was happening live or on TV. The woman's male friend came up to the table again and as he began to walk away she said, Oh. I'm sorry. Let me introduce you to my dear friend Mark. [unknown if this is someone I know in waking life.] He turned back around and shook my hand. I noticed he was wearing a wedding ring but had the impression that he was single. I don't know what gave me that impression. I was thinking what a nice man he was. A little later the woman and I were sitting and talking with him. He had something written across his forehead. It was probably five or six lines of text, very clearly readable, and an arrow with a red stem and blue tip. There was also a birthmark that looked a bit like an x. At first I thought the text and arrow were there for medical reasons and I felt sad for him that he had to live with that and how that must get people's attention and cause them to stare and such. It was impossible not to notice if you look at him but I tried not to look at it long enough to read what it said. I finally gave in though and read it. When I read it, it seemed to be there for fun, saying something about beer and I don't know what else. Then I thought it was just odd."
"0620"	"(2003-07-25)"	"Darren was going to school to become a doctor. I was still working on my Ph.D. Someone was saying something about the medical degree having more prestige or being more valuable than the Ph.D. I stated my usual case that I agree that the medical degree is indeed very valuable to society. We certainly need good doctors and good doctors perform a great service to society. However, they also get paid very well for it and it does not require the same mental capabilities as a Ph.D. People who study for a Ph.D. are not easily recognized for their value to society, though a good Ph.D. brings great value. And they do it knowing they will likely never receive the same financial rewards as a medical doctor nor be given the same respect. In addition, the Ph.D. is by far a more difficult degree to earn mentally because it does not require the memorization of known information or already identified knowledge but instead requires the discovery of new knowledge. A M.D. can get their degree by getting certain grades and fulfilling certain tasks such as residency. A Ph.D., on the other hand, can get stellar grades, complete all requirements and still not receive their Ph.D. if a panel of judges does not approve the final dissertation work based on the dissertation defense - the final step of the Ph.D. process. I don't know who I was telling all of this to."
"0621"	"(2003-07-26)"	"I was driving up to my home and saw one of the maintenance men in a pickup truck close to my house. I did a hairpin U-turn and pulled up along side him, with each of us facing in opposite directions. However, in my dream my driver's side window was right next to his, which couldn't have been true in waking life the way we were positioned. I don't know who the man was; I hadn't seen him or this truck before. I asked him if they were going to be replacing my windows soon. I don't know what he said. I think John D may have walked up at the time. I had agreed to host a cookie baking day at my home for a bunch of my women friends to raise money for local children' charities. The idea actually originated with Alicia J in California. Unfortunately, the day we were to bake cookies the maintenance men decided to install new windows throughout my home. I didn't think it would be a problem because I had been noticing that it wasn't taking them too long to do the replacements in other homes in my community. I didn't have a chance to warn anyone so when my friends started showing up to bake cookies the house was void of most furniture because of the windows. I have no idea where we put it though. In a way this was good because we had lots of room to set up tables for cookies. Matthew had gotten some fold up tables from somewhere for us. The kitchen had two windows and I told them those were especially important to get done quickly so we wouldn't have to worry about dust and dirt in the cookies. Alicia J came to help and brought some one with her. As I was greeting Alicia J and talking to some of the others as they arrived Sue P and Barbara D arrived. They didn't say hello or anything but simply started setting up. They started laying tablecloths on the floor for cookies to cool. I told them we could set up the tables. I sent Matthew to bring the tables in and set them up. I pointed out what large tables they were. I continued talking to Alicia J and there was a man standing there as well who came to help. Alicia J asked him what organization his benefits were going to. He said the Children's Wizard of Oz fund in my city, which I don't think exists in waking life. I was afraid she would ask me and I hadn't arranged to make money off of this so I would have some to donate but I liked the idea of the Wizard of Oz fund. I debated whether or not I should just tell her that I was donating to that group if she asked. I could always make a donation to the group. Julie D came to help and brought her two daughters. I was talking to someone about the windows being replaced and jokingly said something about not knowing what I was going to do with all of my old furniture now. Apparently I was getting grid of some old furniture. Actually it was only my old desk. it was a blonde colored wood with a hutch. I am standing at a table and helping to get set up. I was spreading out bowls and such. I said I would help with mixing. That's what I prefer to do when we have our annual family cookie baking day. One bowl looked like it had a few chocolate chips in it. I then turned around to help get the rest of the room organized. I noticed that Julie D had brought in a children's table and chairs, which I thought was cute and a good idea. There was some food on it - like muffins. I realized that I hadn't had breakfast yet and saw someone had brought muffins for all of us to share that morning. I went and got a cranberry muffin, broke it in half and was eating it while I was walking around. I decided to check with the men and see how they were progressing with the windows, because they didn't seem to be making much progress at all. I went outside and noticed a small fire in the building. They were getting ready to put it out and didn't seem to be concerned at all. this was a very tall city building. The outside was very shiny gold and glass. I noticed a relatively small hole in one of the walls and a fire there as well. Again, they were getting ready to put it out and didn't seem concerned. I hoped my friends didn't find out about it because I thought they would become overly anxious or concerned."
"0622"	"(2003-07-23)"	"I was trying to find some pictures on the SAID website that I was looking for to download. I was having trouble finding them. I finally did find them, or at least some of them. But they were all part of this file that I had to download. In this file there were also a lot of the graphics that were used to create the website. After I finally found the file and downloaded it I was going through it trying to delete all of those graphic images that I didn't want or need so I was left with just the pictures to go through. Maybe I was going to go through those as well and delete the ones I didn't want."
"0623"	"(2003-07-24)"	"It feels as though I went back and forth between being in the dream and thinking about what I wanted to do differently the next time I was or the next time I am in this situation -. I was still fretting about the possibility of damaging my relationship with Ben D. Then I was at church and I was up front in the sanctuary. I don't know why. Maybe I was a Eucharistic Minister. From where I was standing there was someone in one of the very front pews, maybe in the first 3-4 pews. It kind of looked like Ben D but I couldn't tell for sure because he walked by other people, particularly other Eucharistic Ministers. So when people got up and started to come up to receive the Eucharistic I was moving around and leaning forward to see if it was him. I'm not sure if he even came up or if he was just leaving church at that time. But he went to the far left of his pew, turned right, and then went out the door. As he did I saw that it was him. I wondered if he was leaving at that time because he saw me up there and because he was avoiding me. This made me very sad that this might be the case because I was fairly sure that otherwise he would have wanted to chat a little bit after Mass."

"0625"	"(2003-07-27)"	"It seems as though I am myself and at another point it seems that I am Carly from some daytime soap opera. Early in the dream Carly had been kidnapped. Her boyfriend, Jack, who is a police officer, found her, but didn't tell anyone right away that he found her. They made love. I don't know why he didn't tell anyone that he found her. Later she, or I, am with a young college boy. Some other woman found out that she/I was kind of seeing this young college man. He was into computers. That's what he was studying. I'm in this room with this other woman. There are empty boxes under this cabinet. One of them is evidence that he is using AOL. The other is evidence of where I/Carly am. This other woman realized that Jack had found me but didn't tell anyone. She also knew that this man wasn't supposed to be using AOL at school so she wanted to expose both of us. I was trying to get her not to. I'm not sure why. I hid the box that would let people know that Jack had found me. I kind of stashed in towards the back of the cabinet behind something else. I did the same thing with the AOL. Now the college man is working on a project with some classmates. I see his laptop sitting. We're in a mall now but he is sitting with all of these six-foot long folding tables. His laptop is sitting on one of these tables at the front of the room right by the door. There is a big red button on the front that says AOL. It's maybe 1 by 2 inches long. It identifies that he uses AOL. I saw it and knew that it had something to do with this woman who wanted to expose him so I turned it off. I hesitated to interrupt him because he was working with his classmates but decided to anyway. I went up to his left side and bent down and tapped him. He leaned back in his chair and I whispered to him what I had just noticed. He wasn't all that concerned about it. I told him that this woman wanted to expose him but he just wasn't that concerned. Now I'm going through a large department store in the mall. I'm on the first floor and I'm walking through a children's clothing department. I go to the escalator. The two escalators, up and down, are divided by steps. It is a really steep staircase so I decided to take the escalators. Instead of steps on the escalator it is flat like a people mover but it goes up. I get on there and I stand to the left. I reached for the rail but there is a woman who is taking the steps at the same time and she grabs the escalator handrail. Since this is so steep I know I am going to need to hold on so I grab the right handrail. I was kind of irritated that this woman who was walking up the steps was in such good shape that she was keeping up with the escalator. I was upset because I didn't think I was in good enough shape to do that. I moved over to the right of the escalator so I could hold on to that handrail. The escalators were much wider than they are in waking life. Still, as it gets to the top I have to exert a lot of energy and strength to hold on and get to the top. I almost have to pull myself off. Then you walk a few feet and there is another incline and handrail and I have to hold on to that handrail as I walk up this other shorter yet steep incline. I have to pull myself along to get up that one. I finally got up there and I'm walking around. I think I'm in the women clothing department now. The college man shows up and is walking with me. We're walking through the various departments and he starts reading something to me that he found. It's a piece of literature or something that someone had written. It has lots of adjectives. It's very sensory. It talks about smells and sights and such. I thought it was very nicely written and I especially liked all the sensory details. He was kind of making fun of it. I asked him if he had ever really paid attention to the sensory experiences in his life, the smells, the sights, the sounds. He kind of laughed. I said I guess that's a difference in our age. I am 20 something years older than you. I started thinking about that or maybe I was talking to someone about it. Isn't it fairly common for very young men to fantasize about being with an older woman and maybe that's all this was for him. Maybe his desire to be with me was maybe just fulfilling some fantasy, wanting to experience lovemaking with an older woman, what an older woman might teach him about romance and intimacy."
"0626"	"(2003-07-28)"	"I was with Matthew and some other people, though I don't remember who they were. I think we were at PLU. There was some kind of event going on to teach women safety, especially for walking on campus at night alone, even though they didn't recommend that. But if they had to they wanted them to know these techniques to stay safe. That evening I was walking across campus and it was starting to get dark. I was thinking about the techniques. I picked up a round thing and tossed it like a hoop and it landed around this one thing. Somehow that was part of the technique. I then picked it up and later did the same thing. Then I picked it up and went back into this place. It might have been a coed dorm but I'm not sure. There were a bunch of men sitting around, talking and carrying on. This one young girl was getting ready to go out. One of the men yelled at her, Hey. You better be safe out there. I just went off on him. I was so angry. I said, These women are scared enough as it is. They're being taught to do things to stay safe. Then you say something that is frightening. I mean I really went off on him. A couple of the other men that were there kind of supported me and told him he was out of line and that he owed this girl a big apology. He wasn't about to apologize. It seems that maybe there was something that had been happening on campus where some women had been getting hurt that prompted this whole thing. I went back and joined the rest of my group that I was there with. I picked up a hat. At this point I don't think I was myself. I think I was one of the girls living in this, I don't know if it was a dorm. I was living with three other women. I picked up this hat and asked two of the other girls, Do you think this is Jamie's? Jamie was our other roommate. They said they were sure that it was. That concerned me because for some reason I thought that meant that she was in danger of this man who was doing these things. There was an older woman there. Maybe one of the girls mother or aunt. She got a phone call from this man and she put him on speakerphone. The voice sounded kind of creepy. I was listening to things that he was saying and he was saying about something being inspiring. As he said that there were these green vines around some part overhead and they started intertwining as he was speaking and talking about whatever it was that he thought was inspiring. I went to my other two roommates and I said I think that was him. I said, Just by the sound of his voice and the things that he was saying. I'm just so sure that was him. We went to some kind of a snack bar to get something to eat and we moved up through the line. When it was my turn I stepped over to one young girl who was taking orders and she started to help me but then stopped and walked away. She never came back. An adult male who was standing next to her taking orders kept taking person after person after person after me. He said, Well, I need to stay at the register here. He said this to her so she wouldn't come back and try to work at the register also. So I asked him, Could you take me? Because you've taken like 10 people who came up here after me. He kind of shrugged his shoulders and took my order. I ordered a hot dog and a diet sprite. He gave me the hot dog and a can of diet sprite. I started to hand him my money and he took my wallet and asked me if I had some kind of ID or something because I would get a discount if I did. I said no. He mentioned another and another. I said no, no. Matthew said, Well. She does but not for one here at PLU. He said, Well then that won't work. I finally took my wallet back and handed him the amount of money that he needed for my order."
"0627"	"(2003-07-29)"	"I'm not sure if I'm watching this happen or if I'm there. This family is getting ready to get some landscaping work done in their yard. It's a fairly young couple with at least one child, a boy about 8-12 years old. The man is concerned that the landscaping will prevent him from practicing his putting in their yard. He's sitting across the street. The house sits on a corner where the left side of the house is along one street and the front of the house is, of course, along the other street, The man is sitting across the street from the left side of the house at a neighbor's. I don't know if I drew a diagram or if someone else drew it. The wife saw that he would have a place to put and that there would actually be a hole included in the landscape. Actually, there were two different features and they were called different things but they both basically functioned the same, as the putting hole. I can't remember now what the other one was called. I was standing there with a garden hose, spraying the lawn. As I was doing that you could see in the water spray something about these two putting holes. The wife was saying something about how that would look. Then they also had a swimming pool and I think maybe we were filling the pool or adding water to the pool. I went around to the left side of the house to check on the pool. It was pretty full so the 12-year-old was following me around so I asked him if he wanted to run around front and shut the water off so he did. I think he wanted to help so I was looking for ways for him to help. The man was a firefighter and I think the neighbor was also. He had come back across the street to the front yard. There were old fire engines. They looked like antique fire engines. There were two of them. One was parked in the front yard and one in the left side yard. I don't know if they were actually sitting in the yard. They were yellow. Even though they looked like antiques the firefighters still use them. On the one that was sitting in the left yard I started it up and then shut it off. Then I went around to the front of the house. The man had heard me and the engine was still gurgling. I thought there was a problem with the transmission or something that it was still shutting off. A little bit later it was still going - I could still hear it. I was hoping that the man couldn't but he did. He said something to me about not shutting it off fully. I said I did but then when I went to check I realized that he was right. I hadn't shut it off all the way. I went ahead and shut it off the rest of the way. I was thinking about the fact that I hadn't shut it off completely the first time and how he would tell me that I needed to be more careful. I didn't think it was a matter of being careful. The more I thought about it the more I realized that it was a matter of taking the time to make sure it was done right. I could just hear him saying, Well. We're firefighters. We have to do things in a hurry. But even then we know that we also have to take the time to do it right. I could just hear myself getting this speech from him and I was preparing to defend myself. Then I was trying to think of a form of the word cautious and couldn't think of the form of the word that I wanted. I still can't. There may not be such a word."

I was trying to find something to go with peach-colored jeans that I was wearing. The shirts either didn't match or they were too small or too big. I finally decided on something. I was running very late. I asked Bev if Mari Kate S could come up and help me but I don't know if she wasn't there or if she was doing something else. Andrew S came up to help me. He was helping me to pull one of my shirts down in the back. I was leery about having him help but finally decided it was fine. Then he stood outside the door. I told him he had to wait out there because I was going to try on yet another one. When I got ready to leave there were about 5 or 6 steps outside the apartment front door. I kind of ran down but almost in a skipping way. I saw Andrew S follow. I took a right on the sidewalk - it was sloped downward. Then I took another right and it was sloped upward. I was headed to my car. Andrew S was following me and the little girl was following him. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You need to go back inside. Your mom is going to wonder where you are. He kept following me and the little girl kept walking out into the street. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You have to keep her out of the street. She can't play in the streets here. I said it very tersely the second time. He wasn't paying attention. She kept going out into the street. I was getting frustrated because I was late for work. I stopped and turned around and said, Andrew S. You have GOT to keep her out of the street. This time I sounded even more terse. He finally turned around and went and picked her up and headed back inside."
"0629"	"(2003-08-01)"	"Matthew and I were staying at this place. It wasn't a hotel. It was more like a college dorm, but there were families living or staying there. I know at least some of them were single parent families. I don't even know how long we had been there. We had been there long enough that I was involved in a relationship with the actor Dabney Coleman. I was thinking how odd it was that I was in a relationship with him because I don't particularly care for him in waking life. There is something about him that just doesn't feel right to me. We were involved in this relationship. I don't know how serious it was. I don't know if we could even really call it a relationship. We were seeing each other on a regular basis. I was talking this other woman who was sitting there with her children. Her name was Raegen U. We were talking about relationships but I can't remember much about the conversation. For some reason I had gone to her room and the door was partially open. I started to go in and then stepped back because it didn't like anyone was there. I started to walk away and then I thought she was in there with someone. So I went back in just part of the way and realized that she was in there with Dabney. Again I started to walk away but stopped. I decided that I was not going to just let this go. They were being intimate. They were on the floor and had actually rolled partially under the bed. I went in and climbed up on the bed and said, Hey Dabney. How's it going? I had startled them so bad they almost jumped out and sat upright. I kind of saluted him and said, Good to see you. Then I walked out. I thought well that's the end of that and then realized that it made sense. I had this feeling that something like this was going on. I went back to Matthew and asked him if he wanted something for dinner. He said yes he was hungry. I asked him if pizza sounded okay. He said sure. I said, Let me go to the store and get something. He told me what kind he wanted. So I went to get it. I had originally planned to get it for all of us, for Raegen U and her kids and for Dabney and his kids. Obviously that changed my mind so I just got something for me and Matthew. I must have taken it back to Matthew to start fixing it. I had been doing some cleaning. I finished vacuuming our room. Oh. Raegen U and Dabney were in Dabney's room. I took the vacuum to Raegen U's room because I had intended to vacuum her room for her. I decided I wasn't going to do that now. Someone else came in. She was going to give me something for Raegen U's kids and she wanted to explain it to me. I said, Nope. No need. I won't be back. I didn't even look at the person. I just sat the vacuum down and walked out. I said to myself, I knew something was going on. Maybe it was later that I think in the dream I was just imagining having a conversation with either Raegen U or Dabney and them thinking that I was mad. I was imagining saying, No. I'm really not angry. I'm feeling a lot of things but angry isn't one of them. Relieved is one. I'm relieved that I found out when I did. I also feel stupid that this was going on without me knowing about it before now. I'm feeling a little frustrated with myself for not paying attention sooner when I suspected that something was going on. I'm glad that I finally found out."
"0630"	"(2003-08-09)"	"The CAS office was in this big fancy house. Right next door was a business that used a PA system. When you were in the house it was hard to hear when you were talking to someone if the business used their PA system. Caleb S was in town to do some kind of a dream program. He was going to be staying there at the house and doing a class there. It turned out that there was only a handful of people there for it. I got the sense that I was living there as well. I think maybe it morphs from the CAS office to a home and then at one point to a doctor's office. At one point a couple shows up. They may be in their 40's or 50's. The man has a health concern and he came to get a prescription. The doctor wasn't there. I got out a prescription pad and took down the information, filled out the prescription except for the signature. I told him that as soon as I got the doctor to sign it I would call them and let them know that it was ready to pick up. The woman was saying something about how nice the house was. I said, Yes, except for the business next door with their PA system. While I'm talking to them I also have a little girl with me. It's Bev but in the dream she is only 18-24 months old. I'm carrying her around and I'm worried about how well she will behave. But I'm trying to take care of these other people, the couple and Caleb S and his dream students. When I'm with this couple taking care of their prescription I sit Bev in a chair next to me. It's a wood, hardback chair, with no cushion on the seat. I sat her there next to me and pulled the chair very close to me. I'm thinking about how well behaved she is being, being quiet and such. I reach over and rub her hair. After the couple leaves somebody says something, I think I'm getting ready to take a shower and I'm wondering what I'm going to do with her. I decide that I just need to take her in the bathroom with me. Then I think that maybe I'm just going to need to give her a bath at the same time, though I really don't want to do that. I'm debating if it is okay. Then someone says something about Bev needing to use the potty. I guess we're trying to potty train her. I say something about just giving her a book and she can sit on the potty in the bathroom while I'm taking a shower. Then I go do something else first. When I came back I asked if they gave her a book and they said she was just going to stay out there. Now Bev is her current age in waking life. Maybe the little girl is now Rachel S. I'm not sure. It's confusing."
"0631"	"(2003-08-09)"	"I was talking to Bill C and he told me that Blair K had resigned and I was very surprised and I asked how he can afford to do that when he is so concerned about money. I asked him what he was going to do for an income. Bill C said something about him subletting some property or something, but neither of us knew how he was going to make it on that. We were both surprised and a little mystified how he was going to work things out. There seemed to be some other people around too but I don't know who they were. I said something like, Why is it that I've managed to stay around for five years? The other people kind of laughed and I did too but yet I was serious in asking the question. So many other employees seem to come and go so quickly but I manage to stay around. As much as Bill C and I challenge each other, not intentionally but by our personality differences and differences in how we think, I'm surprised that I stay around by both of our choice."
"0632"	"(2003-08-10)"	"Something about my bank account. I'm having trouble transferring money from one account to another. Also, there was not as much money in the account as there was supposed to be. It was several hundred dollars less."
"0633"	"(2003-08-10)"	"I was at a hotel. There was some kind of major event going on. It was almost like a street fair and maybe a parade. I'm not sure. There were vendors in the street that were selling all kinds of things, even clothing. There were racks of women lingerie and all of these different women were taking things and trying them on and then coming back out and looking through the racks more while they were still wearing the lingerie. I wondered where they were going to try these things on. There were a lot of people. I was working my way through the crowd. It seems as though it may have been along a beach as well because at one point I was out walking on the beach. I saw some people trying to find some seashells. I thought I should ask someone, someone that I know but I don't remember now who, if I come out early enough if I would find some seashells. I did find two or three, but I think they were actually just clamshells. They were black and the inside looked like a normal clamshell, shiny, pearlized. But they were very dark. I was with a female friend but I don't know who she was. She had her two little boys with her. We had these things to help children not get separated from their parents, but the parents held on to these things. It was a little round thing about the size of a quarter in diameter and maybe a couple of inches long. The bottom side of it the child pushed in and it locked into place so they wouldn't get separated from their parents. But it depended on the child to keep pushing in on this thing. That seems ridiculous. One of the two boys was playing around with it so I crouched down to their level and looked at the two of them and said, Look. Look at my face. I'm not kidding around. Do you see me smiling or laughing? They were still kind of grinning. I said, Look how serious I am. They finally quit smiling. I said, You have GOT to keep these things pushed in. You HAVE to. Do you understand me? It is SO important that you keep these things pushed in. I don't know if they really understood or not. Then this friend and I decided to take them outside. Now they are little girls instead of boys. Now I think we are going trick or treating. But up until this point it wasn't that time of year and it wasn't the time of day that you would go trick or treating. It was a summer day. On our way outside the mom got detoured and had to stop for a minute. When we got outside it was pouring down rain. The girls didn't like that. I wondered where my umbrella was and was thinking that I should have brought it along. One of us could have carried the umbrella while the other hung on to the girls. We started out a little bit anyway. The one little girl was especially frantic about the rain so I finally said, Okay. Let's go back in. I thought we could at least stand under the overhang until the mom came out. The one little girl let go of her thing and took off running. I was yelling at her to come back but with the rain and everything she couldn't hear me. I was yelling frantically and as loud as I could. Either she couldn't hear me or she ignored me because she just kept running. I was panicking because I thought I would never find her in this business and her mother is going to be so angry with me. Fortunately, her mom came out and met the little girl head on. The mom looked at me and just glared at me so upset. I was standing there feeling helpless. I didn't know what I could have done since I was still holding on to the other little girl. I had told them how important it was that they not let go. When the one took off running I was yelling as loud as I could trying to get her to come back. I couldn't take off running because the one I was still holding on to couldn't have run fast enough and I couldn't have run very fast if I had tried to carry her. It was just a very bad situation. I am back inside without the three of them. There was something going on in the one part of this building. I say hotel but I'm not totally sure it was a hotel. In one part of this building there was a company that was getting ready to do a fashion show. There was some kind of problem that was delaying it. For some reason I needed to get to the end of this building. There was some kind of problem that would keep me from getting there the normal way. I decided to try to take a different way to get to the other end of this building. But as I did there was a high school band getting ready for the parade I guess. I realized I shouldn't be cutting through there but I did it anyway. I was trying to work my way through all of these young people in their band uniforms. I would go through one room and there would be another band. I would try to work my way through that room. Every now and then when I entered another room one of the chaperones or teachers would be there. Fortunately there was so much noise and commotion that when they tried to stop me or ask me what I wanted I just kept going and managed to get past them."

When he came to see me, one of my spiritual direction clients was here so we didn't get to spend any private time together or any time alone. We were both very disappointed by this. He was also I'm having trouble following the thread of this. He had also had a suitcase and had used one of the bathrooms. Maybe he had taken a shower? Later he needed to leave and now the directee's husband was here as well. The husband was in the bathroom so she was going to go get the rest of Ben D's things out of the bathroom. She asked him, I guess, what he normally does with his things. He said he just wipes them off. I think maybe they had a small child also. Maybe she sent the child into the bathroom to his dad to get Ben D's things. The man came out with the things and Ben D had to go. I saw him in his car. It was an old, grey, rusty, faded, beat up car. For some reason I wasn't surprised by this. Maybe it's what I expected or maybe I was thinking that I had seen it when I was in SC. Then he and I are both on the road but in separate cars. I'm ahead of him. I keep looking in my rearview mirror and checking to see if he is behind me. There are one or two police cars. One of them turns on it's flashing lights. At first I'm concerned that they want to pull me over but then I realize that it's not me they are signaling. Then Ben D is in the far right lane and I am in the far left lane. There was bumper to bumper traffic. A couple of times I get very upset because I have to slam on my breaks and I'm worried that I'm going to hit someone or that Ben D or someone else is going to hit me from behind. But nothing happens. There is also another police car in the far left lane that pulls someone over. Ben D and I are both very disappointed that we didn't get to spend any time alone together. For some reason, while we are driving, I keep thinking that I am going to pull off to my right and that Ben D will pull off behind me. I guess just because that is the only way we will be able to have any private time together."

"0637"	"(2003-08-14)"	"I completed my dissertation proposal and had sent it to Deven D. A day or two later he was at my home. This was my house on Lakeland Dr. where I lived with my husband. I wasn't all that surprised to see him there. I asked him if he had been home yet since conference. I think he said he had been home for one day. He had a briefcase sitting at the entrance to the family room. It was sitting open and I saw the envelope for my dissertation proposal in there. At first I was just glad to see it because I hoped that I could talk to him about it now. But then I also thought it curious that he had received it so quickly. There were also things in his briefcase besides papers and the types of things that you would expect to see in a briefcase but I can't remember what they were. There were two other people, women, there. I think they may have been from CIIS. One of them might have been Terri O. We were talking about my proposal. The woman I don't know asked me about my timeline for completion. I said I intend to complete it by Spring 2005. She nodded her head yes. I said that my ideal, however, was to complete it by the end of 2004, though I admitted that I didn't know if that would be possible. She shook her head no, as if to say to me that there is no way I would be able to achieve that goal."
"0638"	"(2003-08-15)"	"I was with Bill C, but I don't know where. We were sleeping together. Well, not exactly sleeping. The physical sensation was so real and intense. I recognized that I was dreaming and took note of the fact that I was feeling the physical sensations so strongly while in a dream. I thought to myself that I wanted to stay with it and pay attention to how intensely I feel the physical sensations. I didn't let it go for very long until I decided that I needed to wake up. Instead I tried to wake him up, which makes me wonder if I was dreaming. As I thought I was trying to wake him up I thought, Oh. This isn't a dream at all because we're both awake. At first he initiated the kissing then we stopped and were talking very briefly about the situation, with me working for him and with him being married. The next time I initiated it with the purpose of making a point. I put my hand on his face and kissed him very hard. I don't know what my point was. He stops. We stop kissing. He jumped out of bed very abruptly and said something about what just happened. I said, Well, we just can't. He said, It's not that easy to just say we can't. Then he said, We'll just have to talk about this later. He had a program or something that he had to get ready for. I did something else to try to test and see if I was dreaming or not and decided that I wasn't. I was standing at a table with a bunch of pocket folders that had various materials in them. Someone came up and said something to me. I said that I worked there, that I work with Bill C."
"0639"	"(2003-08-15)"	"I was with Matthew standing at a register in a store. He was standing to my right. Eight or nine times someone came up and stood to Matthew's right. Each time it was an actor. Matthew would nudge me and point out who it was. One time it was Robert Uhlrich. I haven't seen him act in a few years but I used to think he was very handsome and hearing about some of his community work representing some illness I've also respected that work. I introduced myself to him and told him it was quite a pleasure to meet him that I've been a fan."
"0640"	"(2003-08-15)"	"I had gone into my bedroom but it wasn't like any bedroom that I've had in waking life. There were two light switches. I tried to turn on the lights but none of the lights would come on. The room was pitch black light. Just as in waking life I don't like to walk into a room that dark but I did anyway. I tried to turn each light on at the light source itself but none of them would come on. Matthew came to the bedroom at one point and I told him that I needed him to help me get the lights on."
"0641"	"(2003-08-15)"	"Jan F was at my house. We were talking about cooking. She and Jo V love to cook and I don't. She was talking about taking various frozen meals that come in a bag and mixing them together and fixing them at one time and then having meals that can be heated quickly and having a number of them. I said I didn't think I would want to do that because I would get tired of eating the same thing over and over. I said that I do occasionally fix one of those for myself and have leftovers for a day or two after. She suggested mixing a half of each one for a different variety. I said that might not be a bad idea because then you would get three varieties instead of two or instead of just one. I was cleaning up the kitchen while we were talking. I put an empty can inside of what I thought was an empty pineapple can. But when I did I realized that there was still a layer of pineapple in the can. I pulled the other can back out and said something to Jan F. I asked her if she did that on my behalf and she laughed and said yes. I don't know why. I took the pineapple out of the can and then I was asking here when school was going to be out for the summer and if she would be spending a lot of time in Chicago during summer break. She said that she would be spending a lot of time in Chicago."
"0642"	"(2003-08-17)"	"I was at Bev's house visiting. We were outside walking. There was a little sports car sitting there. I can't think of what it's called. A MG maybe? It was old and the color was grey. I realized when I saw it that they were holding it for me, that it was mine. It ran. You could drive it. But it needed some work to be able to drive it consistently or for very long. I had spent $10,000 on this car. I asked John S if it was saleable as it was, if he thought I could at least get my money back out of it. He thought I could. At that point I didn't want to ask him to try to sell it for me. It was a stick shift and I don't know how to drive a stick shift. I was wondering if I could learn enough to drive it to Daddy's house and ask him to try to sell it for me. I didn't really want to ask him to do it for me either, yet I knew I didn't really know enough about it to be able to sell it and not have someone take advantage of me. While I was at Bev's house I was really wrestling with this in my head, trying to figure out what to do because I wanted it out of there plus I wanted to sell it and have the money instead. In the meantime we were walking around their house, now I think I was walking with someone besides Bev. I was telling this person that I would really like to have a house similar to Bev's where we had a family room and formal living room and an eat-in kitchen as well as a dining room. Where I had a bedroom for each of my children who were still living at home plus one or two guest bedrooms. I saw John kick something with the toe of his shoe and he seemed to be hinting around at something. I told him he could just tell me that I would like him to tell me the truth. I said I would like him to tell me the truth gently but I would like to hear the truth. He told me that there was some stuff in a large plastic container that belonged to me and they had agreed to store it for me. I was digging through it. I think it had a bunch of black stones in it. I dug beneath the stones and found some decorative glass bottles and there were some small plastic containers in there. The large plastic container was hers. I apologized for forgetting that she had those for me. I pulled them all out and was going to take them with me. I could tell Bev and John were both very happy that I was going to take the stuff home. At one point, earlier, it had come out while I wasn't around that John was very frustrated with storing it though he was trying to be nice and not let me know that he was frustrated. So I decided that I would take the glass bottles home and clean them up and keep. There were also some small plastic things that I was thinking about selling at a garage sale or just get rid of. There were also some T-shirts that they had been storing in another place. I think they had things like Coca-Cola logos or pictures or something on them. I decided I was just going to give those to Kim H so I folded them up and gave them to Matthew to give to Kim H for me. I wasn't sure if the large plastic container was mine. There was also a very large blue plastic tray that had many dividers in it. I asked Bev if those belonged to her. She said yes as she took them from me and started to go put them away. I said, Oh. Shoot. She looked around and didn't look very happy, and asked What? I said, Oh no. Nothing. Nothing. She just turned around and went and put them away. I had said that just because the blue tray with dividers would have been very convenient to have for storing little things and keeping them separated. I don't know what I would have put in there or where I would have stored such a thing in my own home. I continued to wrestle with what to do about the car."
"0643"	"(2003-08-18)"	"I was one of five young college students. Two female and three male. We were working on a scientific experiment. We had taken some pieces of food, maybe broccoli, and we had applied something to them. This caused them to grow at a tremendous rate and grow into something else. There were three of them. They had grown to 4 or 5 feet tall over just a few days and had developed these beautiful flowers. One was kind of a teal color, just exquisite. The other was a purple color. Two of the men had extracted something from these plants and had been working with that substance. They were close to developing a substance that would form or become human bone. They had taken an eyedropper and squeezed some of this substance into a form. This would be an incredible medical breakthrough to be able to replace bones of people with related injuries. One of the men took the eyedropper and was squeezing the substance out onto his the bridge of his nose and down the sides of his noise. I kept telling him not to do that because we don't know enough about it yet. I told him he didn't know what he was doing. I was saying this with a sense of panic or urgency. Fortunately it ended up not harming him in anyway but it really frightened me for him to do that. We weren't ready to tell anyone about it yet, about the plants, the way they grew, or the bone development. We were spending a lot of our own money working on this so we were all going broke. We were trying to still make ends meet while proceeding with the experiment and not telling anyone. Twice we were leaving campus by car and we saw a vehicle enter campus that we knew was a bill collector looking for us. So we would take shortcuts through the grass and such to get out as quickly as possible and without them seeing us. The second time one of the men had a black hardside briefcase. He said he had his life savings or something in there. One of the other men said we were about to get lucky. The man with all the money said yes, he would say so. The other man asked how lucky? The first one said, Pretty lucky. I had developed a problem with my throat so went to a medical facility to get tested. A woman working there had me lean over this piece of equipment. Initially I was supposed to try to sneeze a couple of times, which I kind of fake sneezed. Then I was supposed to start coughing onto this thing and keep doing so. As I did this it became easier and easier and I could tell that it was helping. She smiled and nodded. She told me to stop while she pulled a little blue plastic piece out of the machine and put a new one in. Then she told me to start coughing again. After just two or three coughs the blue piece flipped up into a vertical position. She had stepped behind me. I told her what happened. She said that was odd, that it doesn't usually do that. She pulled it out and put another one. I started coughing again. This time I coughed something up that looked and felt kind of like a baked potato. It was a very large amount. She had been standing in front of me. I asked her if that had ever happened before and she said no. She was kind of cleaning it up but I could tell she didn't want to. Her assistant came in and she told her what happened, intending for the assistant to finish the clean up and dispose of it. The assistant was initially just sitting there on a high stool, very nonchalantly with this attitude kind of like, Isn't that interesting but not really interested. Then she realized that the woman she worked for wanted her to clean it up and dispose of it. It dawned on me that I had inhaled something from our experiment and it was causing this problem with my throat. It was almost as though something were growing in my throat. I had to go tell the others but I couldn't tell this medical professional what I realized because I couldn't tell her about the experiment."
"0644"	"(2003-08-18)"	"I had decided to do a four-week dream group at the house. Based on registrations I was rescheduling out another week. I had called everyone to let them know but Lou S showed up on the original date anyway. I had just gotten out of the shower because I wasn't expecting anyone. I let her in. she had three children. Two young girls and a boy around the age of 11. They all followed me upstairs to talk to me while I was getting dressed. I grabbed my clothes and went behind the headboard of a brass bed and kind of ducked down so they wouldn't be able to see while I was dressing yet I could still talk to them. Lou S came over behind the headboard as well just to continue talking. I saw the boy moving very slowly and purposefully over to the bed and then he lay down on his stomach facing me. I said, Now I came over here so you could not see me changing. And you purposefully came over just so you could try to see me change. You just get your butt back over there where you were. Lou S said something to him also. He went back over to where he had been sitting. I went ahead and finished changing. As I did another woman had shown up for group and let herself in and came up there as well. I didn't know who she was. I welcomed her but told her we were having group downstairs and we were just getting ready to go down there. At this point I decided to go ahead and have a group for whoever showed up. I said we could all go down and I would come back up and get the folding chairs. Lou S had brought the folding chairs upstairs with her. My house was different than in waking life. In the dream this upstairs area looked more like a finished attic, with very low ceiling and one big open space. I also do not have a brass bed in waking life."

It seems that there may be several activities going on at once and I was working at the entrance to the dance hall. Later I was in a different part of the building. A couple of people got up to leave an activity and somebody else that was working there asked them why they were leaving. They said because it was time to dance. It was 9:00. So they wanted to be there as soon as the dance started. I was thinking something about them acting just like they would if it were a high school dance. I was also eating chocolate cake. It was almost like it was packaged - kind of like Hostess cupcakes would be packaged. And the shape was more like that of a Suzie-Q. Those things are so messy to eat as this was. I was getting crumbs all over. Raina D was in the dream towards the end. Her, me and someone else were sitting and talking. She asked us if we had fun."
"0651"	"(2003-08-29)"	"I was with a bunch of members of my family. We were at a public park. Mother had to use the restroom. The rest of us stayed in the vehicle. I think it was a van or something because there was a lot of us. Daddy kept driving around. A couple of times he drove by this place that had cement statues or something like that. The second time it was like I was remembering something that happened around there I don't know exactly how to describe that part. Daddy started getting upset because he didn't know what was taking Mother so long. I was thinking that he just needed to stay in one place where she could find us. He finally decided to drive back to where he dropped her off and just sit there and wait. Bob F and I said we would go in and see if she needed help. Then I suggested to Daddy that maybe it would be better if he went in because he was used to helping her and she would probably be more comfortable with him helping her than us. But then she came out, so she didn't need any help. Now it seems that she went in because there was something that she needed to type and post there. While she was doing that I found a little area where they had some small statues and a candle. The candle was like a tea candle in a container that was shaped kind of like an upside down ice cream cone. I lit it. Someone said something about the fact that I shouldn't light it. I thought it would be fine because it was in this container. But then as we were doing that some people had come up and were trying to read it while we were still hanging it and while I was lighting the candle."
"0652"	"(2003-08-29)"	"I had joined a group at church. At first I thought it was a choral group. When I got to church I was running a little bit late. Joanne S was heading up the group. We were processing in with the priest. We had hymn books and we were singing. When it came time for the homily, Joanne S stood up and turned to face the congregation, right in front of the first pew. She had a baby with her. It was a grandchild. There was a table in front of her. She sat the child on the table. They were both wearing pink. She had this kind of a belt thing that she strapped around herself and the child to keep the child there securely while she talked. She started talking about how she prays. It was at that point that I realized the purpose of this group was to share with the congregation different ways to pray. After she finished I think one or two others shared with the congregation one way that they pray. Then after Mass, Joanne S said to me, I need to make sure that I get your phone number because I definitely want you to talk to the congregation about dreams. I pulled out a business card and gave it to her."

Anyway, I realized that there was some kind of miscommunication so he would not be eating with me. I think that's when I decided I was going to wait until Macy F got back and eat with her. I had gotten one of my spiritual direction books. I was sitting at a small table reading. There was another woman sitting there. She tried to start a conversation about the Bible or about spirituality, I'm not sure which. I started to respond but then thought, No, I don't think I want to get into this conversation. There was a little bit of silence. A young man came up and talked a little bit then he walked away. Then this woman said something else that really bothered me. It was about God. She continued to talk about spirituality. What she was saying was really bothering me. She said something about God will get what he deserves. I got really angry and said, What does that mean? She said, well, basically she was saying that the devil will send God to Hell. I said, That's preposterous! How could he possibly do that? She said, With his power. I said, But God is so much more powerful than the devil. She said, No he isn't. I said, Yes. God created the devil. She said, No he didn't. So I started talking a little bit about the Bible and how the devil used to be an angel and God sent this angel to hell. Satan wanted God to worship him, etc. I was getting so very angry. I finally just got up and walked away. I thought, this is why I don't get into these kinds of conversations with people. I think maybe Macy F came back and I told her a little bit about what happened - or someone did. I was so upset. Now Bart H is sitting at a table. I went to sit down to there were a lot of people sitting at this table. There was a row. The tables were set up so they kind of formed a half circle. There were five people sitting along one side of this half circle but there was an empty chair in between each one. The people that were sitting there were sitting there to talk about something. They had these things that were circular and tall, sitting on the table. They kind of remind me of the very large decorative beer steins that I had made for Darren while he and I were married. They had these things sitting on the table. I was supposed to sit between two of them to do my talk or someone was supposed to sit between them. I was now talking to a woman who was in charge of organizing this. I told her this would really not work very well for me with those things sitting there. It makes it very difficult to see. If I'm standing in the wrong position I can't see the person sitting there, I motioned to each of the empty chairs. The woman got a little upset but then told the people to sit there items on the floor. I thought, It doesn't have to be either or. There's a compromise here. I finally said, what if they just sit them on this edge of the table, next to themselves, as opposed to the front edge of the table. I said that would be fine. That would not block anything. That seemed to be okay with her and with those people. I think that's what they were going to end up doing. Then I went back to the table where I thought Macy F and I were going to eat. There were two children sitting there eating. Bart H came up. I asked him if this is where I was supposed to eat. Instead of saying yes or no he said, well, that's fine. I said, But this child is sitting there eating. Is that actually my plate and what I'm supposed to eat or am I supposed to wait for this child to get done and then sit there? I was very confused. I didn't understand. Then he also said something that led me to believe that he was still planning on joining me to eat. Then I was even more confused. For some reason I was still going to wait so I went to get a book. He said something to me and I told him that I was just going to sit and read in the meantime."
"0654"	"(2003-08-30)"	"I was driving home. Matthew was in the car with me but he was only about 2 years old. I was getting ready to turn left on Meridian St. The sun was setting and was in my eyes. Just as I was getting ready to make the turn there were maybe 8 police officers that walked into this part of the intersection. I could hardly see them because the sun was so low in the sky and blinding me. It appeared that one of them was kind of blocking the traffic and the others were doing something in the street. A couple of them had brooms. A couple of them were doing something else. They had gloves on. As I thought it was okay and clear I went ahead and started making the turn and then realized that there was another one there walking across the intersection and sweeping. So I wait until they got by and then went ahead. I was in the left lane and drove a little ways. There were more police officers. I had to kind of stop for a little bit and wait until there was enough space between them that I could get into the right lane and drive by. As I did that I don't know how this is possible. After I did that we are now out of the car and walking along Meridian where I can overhear them talking and I can see clearly what they are doing. I realized that I had gone past something where there were one or two bodies covered up with a white sheet. I realized that what they were doing was that someone was murdered on Meridian St and there's blood, a lot of blood, in these two lanes. They are walking along covering it up. I guess they don't want people to see it. As I continue to walk home, I realize that I don't have very far yet to get home. I'm still in the right hand lane and I notice a man walking almost right with me, at the same pace, but in the left lane and back just a few paces from me. I'm carrying Matthew because he is so little. This man to my left, is dressed in a brown uniform. I look over at him a couple of times. Each time he is looking at me. I finally say to him, I'm really scared. He said, Of what? I said, Of whatever is going on. He said, Can I take him? Without a thought, I suppose I assumed this man was a police officer, I said yes, please. During this same time I notice that there are other people walking in the left lane going the other way and that they are also some kind of security, police officers or something, but working related to this same incident."
"0655"	"(2003-08-30)"	"I was working at the CAS office. There seems to be scene changes. It's kind of weird. There was a part about being at a sleep center and going to have a sleep study. They were trying to there was a girl that was fairly new. She was fitting people for apnea machine masks. Jane C came in. I thought she was having a sleep study too. It is almost as though this sleep center is physically connected to the CAS office. I find out after whatever I did that Jane C had a sex change operation. I'm just completely flabbergasted that she would do this - especially because I knew she hadn't told Bill C yet. I just thought that was very, very wrong. I thought he had the right to know before she decided to do this. I went and found Doctor C and asked him if I could speak to him in private immediately. I told him it was urgent. So we went into a room or his office and I closed the door. I told him what happened. I said, Doesn't he have a right to know this? He's her husband. I think he said that she should have told him but that as care providers they could not breech that confidentiality. I have a folder, or someone had a folder with some pictures. They looked like pictures and articles out of magazines. One of the pictures is of Jane C. One of them looks like a picture of her as a child with another child. I don't know who the other child is. One of them looks like her as a man. I'm talking to someone about this, saying how angry I am, that he had a right to know this before she did it. She should have told him before she did it. I cannot be the one to tell him for any number of reasons. I was also very afraid that he would find out that I knew before he did. I said something to the affect that he thought that she was having some kind of surgery to make her vaginal opening smaller. Then there is something where we are it almost looks like we're in maybe we're still in the CAS office. It looks like we're in a two-story home. There are other women there. We all know each other. We all know Bill C and Jane C. Someone gave me this can of stuff. It reminds me of the toy that you buy that sprays out silly string. But every time I spray it, it just kind of makes a mess on the wall, even though I think I've shaken it well. Some man, of the men there, a friend of ours or something, comes along behind me and kind of wipes it off the wall. One place along the stairwell I notice that the wall has potting soil splattered all over it. In the dream I knew how it got there but now I don't remember. I kept thinking that we needed to get it cleaned up soon before our guests arrive. Somebody ended up showing Bill C this folder or telling him about Jane C or he ends up finding the folder and then someone tells him that Jane C had this operation. He just rushes out to be by himself. I go looking for him because I'm concerned about him. I want to see if he wants someone to talk to. Someone, maybe it's Jane C, tells me that I need to just leave him be for awhile. I said I didn't want to do that because I'm concerned about him. I said sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. I heard someone say that sometimes it doesn't that sometimes you just need to leave them have their time to themselves. Somewhere along here I hear Jane C say that this is something that she has needed to do her entire life. And she doesn't really feel any remorse regarding Bill C because she's just so glad to finally have had this done. Then there is a scene where Bill C is actually confronting her and saying something about their marriage vows not meaning anything, their marriage not meaning anything all these years, etc. One of them walks away, I don't know which one. I go looking for Bill C again. Somewhere along here I admit to an occasional attraction to Bill C when working with him. I said that seems perfectly natural since we have the intellectual connection that we do. That has always been for me the biggest attraction to a man for me - when I have a strong intellectual connection."
"0656"	"(2003-08-31)"	"I was in California. I think with Ben D. I was there representing a company - for professional reasons. We were on an island. In the middle of the island there was a body of water also. We had taken a boat to get to the other side of the island for a professional meeting or something going on. We were going to meet with I don't know. We got on a bus that was going to drive us someplace else. It seemed to be taking so long. I started thinking that we were going to end up where we started. The road was a very bad road. I was surprised by this. It was very rough and muddy and water standing in the road. Every now and then there was a fork in the road and we would always take the left fork which kept us going around the island. There was a woman sitting close to me. It was almost like we were on a very small bus. Maybe there was only one person to each seat with maybe a little space in-between. I can't figure it out exactly. I looked over at a woman. It looked like she was sleeping but then she opened her eyes. I said, This is really a bad road isn't it? She kind of half-smiled and shook her head yes and rolled her eyes. I didn't say it very loudly. A couple of times the vehicle we were in would slide or skid or fishtail a little bit. I kept praying, asking God to keep us safe while we traveled. Every now and then I would say that. We finally ended up back at our hotel. I said, Well look. We're right back where we started. I was thinking about Ben D's car being on the other side of the island now and how he was going to get his car back. I thought it was silly to ride all the way back there. I think part of me just didn't want to. I thought that maybe the hotel has some rental cars that he can rent and go over there to pick up his car. Of course, then he asked me to go along and while we're over there we can get a room and have a little more privacy. Then we kept driving trying to find where we were supposed to be for this meeting. Now where we are driving is all cement. I was sitting in the right side of this vehicle. On the right side of this street was a cement wall that was maybe 3 feet high. It was a very narrow, very steep spiral. I didn't see how the driver could even see the road in front of him. I was so very scared. I was so scared. I kept praying, rapidly and over and over, God please keep us safe while we travel. I made the sign of the cross. I didn't care if anyone else saw it. I was sitting diagonal to the driver, like in the front seat on the right. I saw the driver hunched over the steering wheel, looking out the windows trying to see where we were supposed to be. This made me even more scared-that he wasn't watching the road in front of him but looking for this place that we were supposed to be. We go into some man's room. I don't know if it's his hotel room. There are papers and things scattered everywhere, on the floor even. Almost as though they were dropped or thrown. One of the men that was with us reached down to pick something up and I said, I wouldn't touch anything if I were you. What if he's been hurt or has hurt himself? I said this thinking that he may have hurt himself because earlier he was talking about his job and how he travels. He sells sports advertising maybe. He has to go all these places and meet with all these people. He has to sit and listen to them talk about themselves and about their careers and what got them to where they are now. He said they just go on and on and on and on. I was thinking that I hope that I don't do that when people ask me about my background - that I keep it very brief and concise. But since he had said that I had the impression that he really was very unhappy in his work. That maybe he went back to this place and committed suicide. Also, while we were in the vehicle traveling, I was thinking about radio advertising and thinking that maybe I should try to get in touch with Bruce S again. Maybe I should try to find out what radio station he is working for. I could see if his station would be interested in the one minute spots that Bill C is talking about doing with someone else. I debated whether or not I wanted to mention it to Bill C."
"0657"	"(2003-09-01)"	"This dream had something to do with burning a CD for other people. I don't know who we is. I don't know if we were doing this to sell them. There were a couple of different pieces that were going on the CD. I wanted to make sure that they got burned in the right order. I also said when people put the CD in their computer to play it they would see the name of each file for each track. So I wanted to make sure that each track would be named appropriately so it would make a good impression. There was also something about dividing up the files or some such. Maybe the whole file didn't need to be burned on the CD."
"0658"	"(2003-09-02)"	"I was in a place that I had been before in a dream. I don't know if it exists in waking life. I was in my car on a four-lane street. It was very busy. I was in the far left lane. Cars from the street parallel to me kept turning into the lane that I was in. I had to keep getting over to avoid a front-end collision. One car finally ended up getting into a front-end collision because as I pulled over the car that was behind me sped forward and just ended up in the front end collision with the car that had turned into this on-coming traffic. I went ahead and got around them to get out of the way of the scene of the accident. But there was a school bus there that had pulled off to the side and was getting a tire repaired. So I had to get back over to the left then. Then I barely squeezed through between the bus and the car to my left without causing an accident myself. Then there was another, I think maybe it was a semi-trailer truck. I'm not sure what he was doing maybe making a turn. I was just barely able to squeeze by him to the left again without getting into an accident in between the truck and the vehicle to my left. Then there was one more time that I knew if I didn't really step on the gas and hit it I wasn't going to make it that time. I did just barely. Then for some reason I am walking. I am running, taking shortcuts through alleys and things. I end up in this really bad apartment complex. I hear police officers yelling. I think they are trying to arrest a drug dealer. I am very afraid of getting shot. I don't know where to go because I feel that I see young men running out of the apartment and yelling at each other and I feel like I'm surrounded and I don't know where to go. I finally dart to my left and see a subdivision of homes so I run over that way. It's just starting to get dark, like early dusk. I see these families setting up lawn chairs and stuff in the street. At first I wonder what is going on and then I realize that it is the weekend of the radio station's annual fireworks show. They are usually held on the bank of a river and synchronized to music. It's a really wonderful show. I finally decided to stop and ask someone the best way I told them that I'm trying to get home. I told them about getting caught in that apartment complex. One woman suggested she walk with me a little bit. She took me to this amusement park. They have a ride here. If you just get on this ride and stay on it to the end you'll almost be where you want to go. It was kind of like an alligator ride on water. You just grabbed one that had yellow on it. They were floating on the water and they had a pole coming up the middle to hold on to as you stood on it and floated along the river. During the ride people would get off at various points along the way. But the woman had told me to stay on it until the end and the man who was charge of the ride nodded yes to indicate that was fine with him. As soon as one with yellow came by she pulled it close enough that I could step onto it. I thanked her and nodded to him to indicate a thank you. I stayed on it to the end and so did he. Then there were four or five men, kind of young men, who agreed to take me the rest of the way. I don't know if it was in a car or not. I don't know why I would let them or why they went with me the rest of the way. When we got to my house there were a lot of people there. One of the five men was from another country or spoke a foreign language. I think he was just visiting the U.S. I wasn't able to communicate with him very well. He wanted to wash his hands so he was in the bathroom but he kept grabbing the wrong things. He grabbed a bottle of lotion and I said, No. That's lotion. Then I realized that he couldn't understand me. So I physically showed him. I squirted some soap onto my hands and then washed my hands. He then picked up the soap bottle and it just came out on his hands. I said, Here now rub them together. Again, I realized he couldn't understand me so I was showing him by action. Then there were these other two men. One was dark-skinned, maybe just a dark tan. I think he was American. The other was a pretty average looking man. They were saying they didn't want to leave and were very subtly flirting with me. Nothing crude or offensive. They were laying on my bed. I climbed up on my bed. I gave a very light kiss on the cheek to the one with the dark skin. I thanked him for helping me. They both got up and said they really had to go. The dark-skinned man left the room but the other one stayed behind. He was chewing on a straw. I kept pulling it out of his mouth, kind of jokingly but it was annoying to me. The last time I pulled it out of his mouth I gave him a kiss on the lips and thanked him for helping me. There was obviously some attraction there. Because after the first light kiss to just say thank you, then we kissed again and that one was a bit longer. I could tell he was very attracted to me. It was mutual. We both knew he had to go because his friends were waiting for him. We started walking out. We stopped again in a little hallway. This wasn't my waking life home. We stopped in this little hallway and kissed again. He said, I want to make love to you so badly. I just smiled at him. We walked out into the main part of the house. BJ and Bill F are both there. There are others but I don't remember who. Now it isn't my home. BJ was waiting for those men to take me home because they were also going to stop by a drugstore so I could get some corn pads for her. As we were getting ready to leave I asked her how she was going to get them. I asked her if she was going to give me time to get home and then come and meet me there and then come back here or were you hoping that I would come back here. She just looked at me with a half smile and I knew she wanted me to come back and I did not want to come back. For whatever reason I was really tired and I just wanted to go home. Then I said, I know. Bill F you have a vehicle here right? He said he did. So I asked BJ why she didn't just ask him to run him to the drugstore that is very close by and you can get what you need."
"0659"	"(2003-09-02)"	"I was at a radio or TV station and they were doing some program. I think it was Channel 12. Bob G, the weatherman, and some other man had stepped outside. They were taping with them standing just outside the door. It was winter. He and this other person that was kind of in the shadows was scraping snow off of this van. They were kind of joking around while they were scraping. I don't know exactly how to explain what they were doing. After they stepped back inside it was a DDSI van. Then I found out that it was Joanne N's van and that her and Vince P were there being interviewed, maybe. I was on a platform behind this van and there was stuff sitting around all over the place. I was trying to gently step around this stuff to do whatever it was that I needed to do or to get whatever it was that I needed to get without knocking anything over or breaking anything. I was kind of gently moving these things around. There were two very large bottles maybe three feet tall and dark green glass. They remind me of giant wine bottles. In fact, I think I told someone that they were mine and that is what they were. They were open and at least one of them had something in it. One of them had a wide mouth. The whole bottle was straight up and down as opposed to a typical shape for a bottle. I went and got in a car. I was trying to go home but it was like I couldn't control my car. Now instead of snow it seems that I am driving in sand. It was very white. There was a road but on either side of the road was very deep sand. My car seemed to have a mind of it's own and would speed through this sand. I thought I could at least steer it onto the road and then I would be fine. It took several attempts before I was successful. In those attempts the car would get me to places that were more than just sand. At one place I was out of the car again then. There were these for lack of a better way to describe them decorative scenes set up with statues and things. I kind of reached over one to reach over one to move something a little bit out of the way so I could see it more clearly. In doing so I knocked some angels over. Those displays almost seemed as though they were snow and ice. I said I was sorry, that I didn't mean to knock the angels over. But I don't think there was anyone with me at the time."
"0660"	"(2003-09-06)"	"I was in a hotel. I was trying to use the in-house phones to call for someone to help me with my luggage as I was checking out. I tried several different ones. There were square, green, signs on the walls about 12 in by 12 inches in size. I don't remember exactly what they said but some of them said extension 205 and some said extension 209 for services that I thought might be able to help me, but I wasn't clear which one I should be calling. I think I finally realized that 205 was the correct one however I wasn't being successful in reaching anyone. I am using one of the phones that is close to the corner of a wall where I can see the area on the wall running perpendicular to the right of where I was standing. At the end of that wall was the registration desk. There is a man and a woman behind the desk. The woman is also on an in-house phone. She sees me and holds the phone away from her ear and looks at me and shakes her head no. I hang up the phone and walk over to her. She tells me that this is not a public phone. That made me kind of angry that she would think I didn't know that. I thought about explaining to her what I needed but decided against it."
"0661"	"(2003-09-06)"	"There were a lot of people at my house. It looks pretty much like it does in waking life except that the staircase is open so you can stand at the top of the stairway and completely see into the living room. I was in my bedroom doing something and I overheard Matthew tell someone that his parents had divorced because his mom had left his dad for power or something like that. I went out to the hallway and said, WHAT? He said, Well, that's what dad used to say. Of course, he has changed his story now. I just said, That's ridiculous. I went back into my room. Angie Ho was there and was laying at a diagonal on my bed. I said, If I have so much power I wouldn't be where I am now. She kind of laughed. There are a lot of members of my family there. I went back out into the hallway and was talking about my life. I was standing at the top of the stairway but talking to people who were downstairs, like some of my family. I said, You know, it's like I was watching this show on TV where people asked a friend to help them redecorate a room in their house. They work for two solid days. They work hard. I realized that I do not have a friend in my life that I would ask to help me for two hours let alone two solid days or that I think would do that. That made me very sad. One of my sisters, maybe BJ, was kind of echoing what I was saying, for two hours let alone for two days. As I was headed back into my room I saw that Rachel S was getting ready to take a bath. I stuck my head inside the door and said something. She jumped out of the bathtub. She was all wet. There was something about bedtime. I said, No. You're in there now you might as well go ahead and finish. So she got back in and she was letting the water run and run and run. It was getting pretty high. I told her that she needed to turn it off now. She tried to ignore me. I said, Rachel S, turn it off. Someone else, I don't know who, reached in and turned it off. I told her to now go ahead and get done with her bath. She did. I then went back into my room. Now Mother was in there. She was complaining about something. I'm not sure what. I think maybe she was complaining about one of my siblings and something that she feels that they do all the time that she doesn't like. I said something to the effect that I try not to do that. I have a sense that the fact that I try not to do that irritates some of my siblings, or maybe all of them. Or maybe they don't believe that I try not to. I can't really remember what it was. It was something about communication though like complaining all the time or trying to get people to feel sorry for me or something like that. Anyway, Rachel S got done with her bath and came in and got ready for bed. She went downstairs and as I was getting ready for bed I realized that Mother was planning on sleeping in my bed with me. I wasn't very happy about that but I didn't feel that I could say anything. I knew I needed to get Rachel S put to bed first. I went back to the top of the stairway and told her that she needed to come up and get ready for bed. She asked if she could sleep with me. I said, Don't worry. We have a bed all fixed up for you. I heard a couple of people together downstairs say, Yeah. With her. I hadn't. Mother and I had folded up some blankets on the floor, next to my bed though, and put a pillow there. So she came running in my room and kind of flounced down on there laid down. Mother had put the pillow and blankets very close to the bed and up high so that she came very close to really hitting her head hard and hurting her self badly on the corner of my nightstand. I was thinking that we needed to pull that out so if she got up during the night or when she gets up in the morning she won't hit her head on that. I was concerned that she could hurt herself badly if she hit her head on the corner of that nightstand. I don't know if I actually said it that we needed to move it or if I was just thinking it."
"0662"	"(2003-09-06)"	"I'm in a public place with some friends and with Paige Davis from Trading Spaces. We're outside and they have a wooden deck. I kept finding coins on this deck. The deck was made of a redwood colored wood. Paige or someone had said that we, this included me, needed to save our money to buy our wedding dresses. I'm not sure if she was only referring to the found money or not. I was amazed at how frequently I kept finding coins in this area. Sometimes the deck was wet. I also found a stack of very large coins and casino chips. I found the man that they belonged to and tried to return them to him. He only wanted one of them back, in the amount of $50. I tried to return more to him but he pushed them back at me. Paige was also amazed at how much money I was finding in coins this way."
"0663"	"(2003-09-07)"	"I was in a hospital and there was no one to come and see me. No one came to visit me. I kept having to get in some kind of piece of equipment. I had to lay on my left side and down in water. The nurse told me how good it would feel but it didn't. It was very uncomfortable and the water was cold. Well, not exactly cold but chilly. Lukewarm at best. I had a hard time changing positions when I wanted to. I was talking to other patients. I would go outside and sit sometimes. Later it became a big fancy house instead of a hospital. Maybe I owned it and was selling it. I had kind of become friends with one of the patients. She and her husband had decided to buy it from me. They didn't think that I would believe them that they really were going to. We were having a meal of taco salads, tostados or something like that."

"0668"	"(2003-09-13)"	"There was as trailer truck that had delivered some gardening supplies to my house. I had some left over and so they were returning them to the garden supply store. I guess I had followed him in my car. He pulled up along the front of the store but he stayed in the street. Along one side of the store was a chain link fence. On the outside of the truck was a metal frame. The trailer had a metal frame with canvas sides that you could unhook to get to the stuff that was on the trailer. I had climbed up on the outside of this trailer to unhook the canvass so we could unload the extra stuff that we were returning. I was trying to hold on. There were two places, one at the top and one at the bottom where the canvass needed to be untied. Then there were two places in the middle that had metal clips that you had to squeeze to take off of whatever it was attached to. I was concerned that he had left the truck in the street because I knew it was blocking traffic. I wanted to get it unloaded as quickly as possible. I was trying to hold on with one hand and undo the canvas with the other. I had let go with both hands because I needed both hands to undo the canvas, then I grabbed back on. After I did it I thought it was strange that I didn't fall when I let go with my other hand. I got the one side undone and the truck started rolling forward. I got in front of it and just pushed it with my hands back some so it wouldn't roll forward. As I did this the trailer moved at an angle towards the fence. I actually think it bumped up against the fence. That also stopped it so it roll again. There were 2-3 men that came out of the garden supply store and picked up all of the stuff that I was returning. There were also some little things like little metal clips or something that the also picked up. I think I picked up one of those and the last bag of whatever it was that I was returning. They were all bags of peat moss or mulch I'm not sure. As they grabbed everything and got it off the trailer and were returning it I made the comment that there was one bag of something else that I needed to take with me."
"0669"	"(2003-09-13)"	"I'm at a restaurant. Matthew was working there. I know they serve pizza. I was back in the kitchen area talking to Matthew. The owner was back there also. I watched him cut a pizza to take out to a customer. I'm having a conversation with Matthew about something that he sold at school like he was selling it for a fund-raiser. He had taken orders. I think it was food items. He had taken orders but now he was having trouble collecting from people. I was concerned that he was going to have to come up with the money himself and then be stuck with this food. He showed me the money that he had collected and gave me the list of what he had sold and who he needed to collect from. We were checking off what he had gotten paid for. There was some confusion. He showed me a check for $56 and told me who it was from so I checked it off. Then later he said, Oh no. That wasn't from them. It was from someone else. I corrected my notes. As we were talking, because I was concerned that he was just going to have to come up with the money. He said, No. I don't have to. If they don't come through the company just takes the stuff back. But the man that was supplying this food was really upset because he wasn't being successful at collecting this money and he was really unhappy about having to take this stuff back. I could tell the owner of the pizza place was getting aggravated with us for trying to resolve this then. Someone brought another pizza out of the oven, so I cut it myself so it could be taken out. Matthew said he was just going to leave work, that he needed to go take care of this. I told him he wasn't. He said there was nothing else that he could do. I told him that there was. I told him that he was hired to do a job, to be here when he needs you to be here, to help him run his business and that's exactly what you will do. Well have to take care of this another time. I think Allison P was working there also. I think her and I were talking for a little while. I don't know where Matthew went or what the owner was doing. But Matthew and I were talking a little bit. She was talking about some TV show and these two stars on this show and what they were doing. I had no clue what she was talking about and was just pretending to know."
"0670"	"(2003-09-15)"	"I was with Ben D. We were very close, in a number of ways, though not sexually at all really. We had been laying together, I think sleeping. We were kissing. He got up and straightened his clothes and then laid back down and kissed me again. Then he got up and told me to stay where I was. I was lying on my side in a fetal position. He was going to lay on his back and rest his head on my leg. He said something. There was some confusion as to whether he said he was leaving or leaning. I knew what he meant was that he was leaning. Wherever this confusion came from about leaving I knew it was wrong. It's almost as though it came from someone else - not him. It was shortly after that, that he got up on his knees, I was lying on my back. He leaned over me very close to my face and I think I said to him, I love you, you know. And he said, I love you too. Very much actually. I was quite surprised. I don't know if I was so surprised that he felt that way but that he would say it. I told him that I loved him too. I don't know where we were. But I was at this place that had this water feature in their yard. It was made of several different materials and different levels. At one point you could step onto it and kind of like slide down. It was almost a step effect. They were shaped almost like a seashell so that they had kind of a cup effect but they were really hard and strong like stone and they were very smooth which is what allowed you to slide down from one to the next to the next. I did that a couple of times. Each time I would run back up. One time when I was doing this I realized that there were little water creatures in a lot of these little places. They were like little toads and things. One that was very large had a number of different creatures in it, like fish and other things. As soon as I realized that I didn't want to slide down anymore because I didn't want to step on anything but because I didn't want to feel that against my feet but also because I didn't want to injure or kill any of these creatures. Then I was walking around a grassy area. I felt a rumbling, or moving under my feet. I realized that something was trying to break up and through the ground. I didn't realize until later that it was some kind of a creature. I said something to Ben D about it and he kind of dismissed it. I said very firmly, NO! There is something trying to get out. When I said it so seriously he took it seriously. He knew what it was. It finally broke through. It was an ugly beast. Not really ferocious but yet dangerous. I just took off running away. I didn't get very far until I realized that Ben D had stayed. He had stayed to fight this beast to keep myself and the other people around safe. This creature was kind of being almost teasing or taunting at first. I had these feathers in my hair. They represented some kind of dedication to Ben D. Someone handed me a red feather and suggested that I go running through this area, waving this red feather, because this would cause this creature to get more angry and to chase after me. When I did this, Ben D and whoever was helping him would be able to defeat this creature so he would no longer be a threat. I was afraid but I decided to go ahead and do it so I would be doing my part. The first time I ran through I did it so quickly that it just barely riled the creature. He knew someone had run through flashing red but that was about all. So I was getting ready to do it again when I woke up."

There was a struggle between him, the mother, the son, and myself.

"0678"	"(2003-10-01)"	"I had gone on a trip with some family. I know Bev was along but I don't know who else. There were at least three of us sharing a hotel room. When it was time to start packing to get ready to go we were all rushing around. I kept asking if I had time to take a shower before I left. I said something about the fact that I was going to be traveling for so many hours that I really wanted to be able to take a shower before we left. I finally decided that there was time. So, I got all of my stuff together and put it on my bed so I could pack very quickly after I finished taking my shower. Then I found my toiletries and went to take a shower. The showers were in a big common area and both genders took their showers in this big common area. The showers were square, cement stalls and the opening was just big enough to get in if you turned sideways. They were only about chest high. They were so small that you barely had room to move. I wondered how in the world people were supposed to take a shower in this. There was no shower head. It was almost as though it filled with water. I was reaching down and bringing the water up with my hands to try to clean myself. I really wanted to wash my hair. I was trying to figure out how I could do that in this kind of shower. Then I realized that I had forgotten to bring my shampoo with me. I asked someone to go get my shampoo - maybe one of my younger nieces - maybe Rachel S but Rachel S as 8 or 9 years old. She asked me if I could use hers. I told her that was fine. She had it right there handy. At this point though I'm sitting. There is a pool of water by my legs so I'm reaching down and cupping water in my hands and bringing it up to my head to try to get my hair wet. I put the shampoo in. I don't remember finishing though. we are all getting all of our suitcases together and putting them in this one area. This area is my birth home. We're pulling all of our suitcases and stuff into the garage. I come through the breezeway and I'm headed into the garage. There are some kind of little things sitting on the breezeway. They almost look like little burial plots about the size of Barbie dolls. But they looked like they were made to some of them had. I don't know how to explain this. They were kind of like statues of saints but they were laying on the top of these. I asked someone what they were and they said that Bill F had made them. About that time Mother comes up and has these boxes that are about the size that two of these dolls would fit in. She said something about finding them. She said they were storage boxes for her Barbie dolls for her to keep Barbie dolls in that she hasn't sold yet at a garage sale. We were commenting what a fancy way that was to store those dolls. "
"0679"	"(2003-10-02)"	"This dream seemed to be about redecorating two rooms in two separate houses belonging to twins in their early twenties. They both owned a dog that came from the same litter. They wanted the rooms done exactly the same because of the dogs being so much the same. I don't know if these can be twins. There was some problem that they kept running into or that the decorator kept running into over and over. There was a man that looked like this man named ""Ziggy"" that was on a decorating show that I saw in waking life. He came and made some kind of large donation to a charitable organization. Someone else did the same. There was also something about two or three flowers stands like I have on my front porch in waking life. I think this was going on in or around the garage."

"0684"	"(2003-10-11)"	"I was with three of the characters from the TV show Ed. I was with Ed, Carol, and Molly. It wasn't on the show. The four of us were friends. It seems that maybe I was closest to Carol. The four of us were in a car going somewhere. Ed was driving and Molly was in the front seat with him. I was sitting directly behind him and Carol was behind Molly. Ed was talking about something that he did. None of us could believe that he had done that. I reached up and tousled his hair with both of my hands and said, You silly man. He ran his fingers through his hair. I was afraid that I had irritated him or made him mad - that he didn't like it that I tousled his hair. He didn't say anything though. Carol laid down in the backseat and put her head on my lap. I reached down to brush the hair out of her face and accidentally rubbed her face roughly or the wrong way. She jokingly said something to the others about me being rough. I also had a sore on the ring finger of my right hand. It was kind of inside where it would rub against the second finger. It was a big round thing. It was too large to be in that spot on a finger. I had been messing with it. It was almost as though it was a wart and I had been picking and pulling at it and I had maybe pulled it out myself. It hurt a little, but not that much, not as much as you would expect it too. I kept looking at it and thinking that I needed to go see a doctor about it. I don't remember actually talking about it."
"0685"	"(2003-10-17)"	"A bunch of high school children were involved in some kind of play or some such. They had set up in front of the office to make it look like they were killing some of the people on stage or like they had found them and were taking them prisoner. What the audience didn't know is that they really did it - it wasn't just an act. They took them to this place and laid them in boxes, for lack of a better word. It looked like a long row of window seats that you could open and put things in. They put these people in there and left them. A lot of them bound and gagged. Later, for another program, they intended to go get the people and kind of do a repeat performance. This time they wanted to let them go. They were trying to keep this a secret from people, that they had done this. At some point, I think it was during the second performance, I realized that Matthew was involved in this. I was extremely distraught. I was hiding in the back hoping not to get caught because I wasn't sure what they would do to me. I wanted to get I don't know why but I was trying to find out what they were doing. Maybe I was suspicious that this is what they had done and I was trying to verify it. I was trying to get back out without being seen. I guess I did and then I saw Darren. I told him about it. He was as upset about it as I was. As soon as we saw Matthew we ran him to the car and told him to lay down in the backseat so he wouldn't be seen. We were trying to get him out of this group without being seen so he wouldn't be hurt. For some reason I couldn't go to the car right away. I had to go back and get something and try to sneak back to the car again. Darren seemed very anxious and upset because it was taking me too long and he just wanted us to get out of there. "
"0686"	"(2003-10-17)"	"I was driving a car in a parking lot. It had places that were blocked so you couldn't drive through. I saw one vehicle going out another way. At first I was going to try to get out a different way. Then I realized that the other way was either the best way or the way you were supposed to get out or maybe the only way. I finally headed that way to get out onto the road. It was almost as though the road was a country road. It had been raining a lot. The rain had broken out the pavement. On the other side of the road there was a stream but because it had rained so hard the stream had broken through the pavement and continued across the road into this parking lot. I was driving through this parking lot to get to a place where I could pull out onto the road. There were big breaks in the pavement where this stream had broken through. I tried to also avoid these very large potholes and places where the pavement seemed to be buckled and piled up. As I was sitting and waiting to pull out, it must have been dusk because the cars had their lights on. The driver in the car behind me was becoming very impatient. There was a lot of traffic. I was going to be turning left so I was waiting for an opening large enough for me to be comfortable pulling out. Finally, because of the car behind me, I always get worried that they are getting mad at me if I take too long to pull out, so I finally just took a chance and pulled out very fast. I did make it okay and didn't cause or get in an accident."
"0687"	"(2003-10-18)"	"I was working at BCC. We were driving to work, myself and another woman. As we were pulling up we were talking about the one circular drive that people can use to drop someone off or executives can park in the one parking lot off the circular drive. We were talking about the executives only thing. We went to the regular employee parking lot and parked. Myself and this other woman were both wearing business suits. We were walking down the sidewalk to the door. For some reason I got behind her, she got a little bit ahead of me. I had some papers in my hand and my daytimer. I started to run a little to catch up with her. As I was putting my papers in my daytimer. We started skipping. To catch up with her I had to pass a businessman in a suit. We started skipping. I laughed and said, look at us skipping to work. We liked our jobs and were happy to be going to work. This man caught up with us and started talking very surface stuff about going to work. He wasn't very excited about going to work. Apparently his department wasn't doing well. We said something like Well, you should work in our department. There was something about the fact that his department wasn't doing well, wasn't meeting their numbers or something and our department was, plus we said we work in the best department anyway. He said, Really? You work in chocolate? We said, Yep! As we got in the building, he smiled and went through another door to get to his department. We had to go through a different door to go up to our department."

I must have been at the sleep center but I had some three ring binders that I was going through. They were my personal binders but I found some documentation in them that belonged to the sleep center. I pulled those out and gave them to Lilly H and asked her to put them back where they belong, with the sleep center files. There was something about the insurance. I had asked them who was doing that now and they said no one. I said, You mean they decided to just go back to not collecting from the insurance companies. They said they thought that the hospital had hired, maybe an outside service, to do the insurance work. Maybe even for all the departments but I don't know."

He said he wanted to talk to me and I told him that I really didn't have anything to say to him. It seems that this happened twice before I got away but I'm not sure how that could be."
"0690"	"(2003-10-21)"	"Matthew and I were in a car. Someone else was driving. We were in my mother's hometown. I don't know why we were there or where we were going. We were about to pass Grandma H's house and I wanted to point it out to Matthew. We went by it too quickly and I wasn't able to. There was an old house that was very rundown, maybe even a lot of fire damage. The owner was selling it because they didn't want to put the time and effort and money into making it livable again. It seems that maybe BJ bought it. We were driving and I was thinking that there was a house on 3rd Street that was significant. I don't know if it was this one. I kept thinking that I wanted to go by it, maybe to point it out to Matthew. We ended up at this house, I'm pretty sure BJ is the one who bought it. At one point in the dream she is talking about going ahead and moving in right away, as is. Maybe she could live in one room that wasn't too damaged. There is a man. I don't know if it is Uncle H. I think it is because as I'm watching him and following him around this house I'm thinking that he looks so much like Grandpa H. I don't know that he really did because I don't remember much about Grandpa H except the pictures that I have him. I just kept thinking how much he looked like him. I remember seeing him walk up a stairway to another floor. I don't know if he is showing us around this house or if he is just checking it out with us. If he is doing it there was a problem with the plumbing maybe. Maybe we heard noises or rattling that made us think there was a problem with the plumbing. We went into the different rooms. Some of the rooms BJ was going to turn into different kinds of rooms. She might change the old kitchen into a bedroom. She was going to make one of the other rooms the kitchen. The house was still full of stuff from the previous owners. I don't recall seeing furniture but lots of boxes and just a mess."

"0692"	"(2003-10-21)"	"There was something going on in my home. There were two men who seemed to wander in and were wandering around the house. I asked them what they were doing there. I don't know if I heard the answer or if I just don't remember the answer. Maybe I got distracted right away because of whatever else was going on. Later I saw them again and asked them again. This time they said they were with the phone company so one of them picked up a phone like he was working on it. I was clearly aggravated and asked him if he had a supervisor that I could call. They said sure and handed me this thing that looked more like a calculator than a phone but I guess it had the supervisor's phone number in it. I walked away thinking that was ridiculous. They could have that set up for me to call anyone and the person on the other end could be in on whatever they are doing and just pretend to be a supervisor with the phone company. I decided to look the phone number up in the phone book and call the company that way to see if these men were who they said they were. I don't know why they were there even if they were with the phone company because I wasn't aware of having phone problems."
"0693"	"(2003-10-24)"	"I was at a hotel with Bill C. We were giving a presentation. When he first started the program there were only three or four people there. We had the tables set up in the U shape that we typically do. I was sitting at one of the tables. There was a gentleman sitting next to me. He reminds me of the man who usually sat behind me at photography class. About one half hour into the program I noticed some people standing outside the door so I went out and told them to go on in and have a seat. Tons of people started coming. I started asking them if they had trouble finding us or if they misunderstood what time the program started. I'm pointing out empty seats to people. I filled all the seats and there were still more people. Some were just going in and getting some chairs from a different place in the room. It was a very large meeting room and we were just at one end where we had set up our tables. The rest of the room was set up as the people who had arrived on time had been served a meal before the program. The facility had not cleaned it up yet. Some people were just grabbing chairs from there and dragging them over to where we were and just sitting outside of the U, not at the tables. I went over and started clearing off one of the table, putting the stuff onto another table. Someone of them were six foot tables and some were very small square tables with a single leg in the middle. I started to sit something on one of the small square tables but decided it might get out of balance and this stuff fall off. Some of the things were bowls about the size of punch bowls and they had ice water in them all the way to the edge. I tried to sit two of those on one of the small square tables, at opposing corners to balance them but I was still afraid they would spill so I moved them to another table. Then on this same table someone had left part of a sandwich from a fast food place. I was trying to clean it up without actually touching the food. I finally cleaned off one of these tables and turned it so it was parallel to one of ours and put a couple of chairs there for more people. I went into another room that had computers in it. I was going to try to quickly type up a form with three columns of blank lines. At the top of one I was going to put Name. At the top of the next I was going to put Email. At the top of the other I was going to put Fax. I knew Bill C would want that, to have people write down their information before they left. I was going to make this form and then stand outside the door with this form on a clipboard so people could sign it as they left. When I went into this other room with the computers, someone had been messing with my computer. I couldn't figure out how to reset to the way I had it set up so I could find my word documents. There was a woman in that room working at a computer. Her computer was fine so she was going to do it for me. But as she started our program ended and even though I told her there was no need to do it now she kept working on it. I think she might have actually been filling in these people's names and emails and fax numbers but I don't know how she would know this information. Later I went to find Bill C and I saw him sitting in the back of this empty room in an upholstered armchair. He was looking very ashen - not physically well. I expressed my concern. He said something about not being able to discuss personal things with me - at my lead. There was also something about small, black discs that looked like tiny LP's. And there was something about kisses. "
"0694"	"(2003-10-24)"	"I'm alone in my hotel room. I was getting ready to go. I used the toilet and took a shower. There was so much stuff."
"0695"	"(2003-10-25)"	"I had gone into the office. I was kind of dressed up, in a skirt and jacket kind of suit and high-heeled shoes. The office building had a much larger lobby and maybe something like a kiosk or two set up in the lobby. It seemed to be for business people, at the least the first time I walked by them. I had gone into the lobby a second time and stopped and sat down at one of these Kiosk's. I opened a package that we had received in the mail. It had a set of pens and automatic pencils in it that had the CAS name and logo on it. It was from a company that was trying to get us to purchase these. It wasn't a bad set but they were purple and that certainly isn't a color Bill C would purchase. The pens and pencils themselves looked nice enough. Not very impressive. Bill C came out and had one in his hand. The package that he hadn't opened. He said something to me about it and I told him what it was. We were back in the office and there was another employee there named Sally [unknown in waking life] . I walked by Bill C's office and Bill C and Sally were standing there in a kind of casual embrace. He was leaning against the wall. She had her arms around his waist and he had his around her shoulders. Obviously she was shorted than he, as most people are in waking life. They kissed lightly a couple of times. This bothered me a lot. I was thinking about why it bothered me so much. I didn't know if it was because he is a married man, or if I was envious for some reason. I didn't sense that it was a romantic thing between them or a romantic envy on my part. They had become good friends and appreciative of each other through working together and that's all it was. My feelings might have been an envy of that type of relationship - or that he would demonstrate that with her in such a way, even though he may feel the same towards me. I got so upset though that I finally decided to leave for a little while. I went home and changed clothes. Or was about to change into slacks and a more casual top and more casual shoes. When I got ready to leave and go back to the office I found two things in my mailbox. They were things that I had sent out from work but they were returned to me at my home and they were open. I don't remember why they were returned to me. I struggled getting them out of the mailbox and took them into the house. I was looking at why they had been returned. I left and went out to what I thought was my car. I hadn't parked where I normally do. I had parked down further to the left and to the other side. When I got over there I realized it wasn't my car at all and I was looking and couldn't find it. I finally realized that I had parked a couple of streets over. I was in a hurry because I wanted to get back to the office before 4:30, hoping Bill C would still be there when I got there. I thought, Omigosh. If I still have to walk all the way over there to my car I may not make it. My home was different than in waking life. I was looking at this grassy area, kind of like a common area behind my house. I thought that maybe if I cut directly through there I could get to my car quicker. I tried to do that but there were lots of families, especially children, back there playing. It occurred to me that it was Saturday and that Bill C may not be there when I get back anyway. I was still going to try. It occurred to me how unusual it was that I would be dressed up the way I was or even am now to go into the office on a Saturday. I was trying to make my way across this common area, through all of these people. I had to stop a couple of times. I heard someone say, Excuse me ma'am. There was a football headed towards me and they didn't want me to get hit. I went a little further and then there were two moms, one was pitching and the other batting, and the kids were playing the field. They were all within a few feet of each other though. I had to wait. I couldn't get around them. I had to go in between the pitcher and the batter so I had to wait for a break. As soon as there was I ran through. Then I came to a place where there a lot of chain link fences like you would typically see around a sports field. I had to climb up and over fence after fence after fence. I don't know that I ever got to my car or back to the office."
"0696"	"(2003-10-26)"	"I started out running some kind of errand for CAS on my way to work. I started out going across town as though I was going to visit Jennifer K. At some point though I headed downtown. I was at a place where there were two lanes in the street going each direction. There were a lot of parked cars along the sidewalk. In some places there wasn't enough room for another car to drive in the right lane, where I was. Yet, I somehow managed to get by without getting into an accident and without hitting any other vehicles and without being hit. There were a couple of times that I didn't know how I managed that. At one point there were a lot of big puddles of water in the street and another time it seemed as though it was piles of snow. Later it seemed that I was on a bicycle instead of in my car. At that point I was trying to figure out how to get to Jennifer K's from downtown. I was at an intersection. There were a number of men standing there. Some of them were smoking cigarettes. One of them asked another for directions. I wondered if I should ask the same man for directions to Jennifer K's. I hesitated and finally decided not to. Then I was riding my bike down this street. It seems that the other people were walking. I was having a really hard time getting traction on the snow and ice. I think someone behind me realized that I was struggling to get traction and so, and I'm not sure if it was a man or woman though I think it was a man, they pushed me until I was in a place where there street was clean and dry so I could get traction. I wanted to turn around and say thank you but I knew I wasn't good enough on a bike to be able to do that without stopping or losing my balance. I decided that I would have to just yell thank you and keep going but I don't recall actually doing that. I kept going and got to a point where I stopped again because I wasn't sure where I was. I thought that if I could get to 38th and Kessing well twice I was trying to figure out how to get to 38th street. I knew I could get to Jennifer K's from there. I was at 38th street but I didn't know the cross street so I still wasn't sure. I kept going and I finally got to a point where I thought I knew where I was. There were a couple of women or girls standing there. I asked them to clarify where I was. The one who answered me made it more confusing. I finally said, Yes, but if I go over this bridge then there's a McDonald's to the left and what used to be a T.J. Maxx store and there is a movie theater to the right. She looked at me oddly. She said, McDonald's yes. T.J. Maxx I don't remember ever being there. The movie theater, yes. I thought, Ah. I know where I am then. That's where the SFI store used to be. I didn't say anything else to her. I got back on my bike and headed back out. I was still lost. I ended up in this place where there were some people who worked for a candy company. They were delivering these boxes of candy to these different stores. I ended up by a very odd little store. It was as though it was located at the top of a ramp and it seemed to be kind of an open-air place. I don't remember there even being doors on it. It was a store full of snacks and candy and stuff. There was a box of this candy there. Someone came in and asked if they knew if this was supposed to be for them or for another store in their company. The man who was working said he had no idea. This candy was a combination of candy and ice cream packaged together. Like two separate things packaged separately and then together or attached together. I left there and ended up in this place where some women were working around a lot of boxes of furniture. They were involved in remodeling an office. They had twelve pieces of each of these different kinds of furniture. They all looked alike. Some woman came up and was talking about a round table that was there. She said she didn't want that in her office. The other women told her that every office was supposed to get it. She said, Yes. But I don't want it. They said, Okay. That's fine if you don't want it. I think they gave me directions too, because I think I was still lost. I got back on my bike and started out again. Then I ended up at a place where there were three men working. They might have been construction workers but I'm not sure. They were working on something where they were attaching pipes to each other or to something else. They had copper colored pipes. The things they were using to attach them were copper colored kind of rubbery pieces but yet they clamped them tight to hold the pipes together. One of them was explaining this to me and I said, Yeah, it's an okay job. I saw that it wasn't clamped tight enough in a couple of places and I kind of use my thumb to peal it back. I thought it wasn't going to work very well. He kind of laughed at me as though I didn't know what I was talking about. I just ignored it because it wasn't that big of a deal to me. I was actually there to ask them for directions and telling them where I was trying to go. They said, And you're on a bicycle? I said yes. They said, Why don't you let us do you a favor and take you there? I almost cried at that point because I was so frustrated and I really didn't want to be on my bike anymore and I didn't want to keep trying to find it and not being successful. I said, You would do that for me? He kind of looked at me like, Well, Yeah! Kind of like, why wouldn't I? Then this other man said, Excuse me. I got the impression that he was maybe the supervisor and it was up to him to make such a decision. I looked at him and he said, That's fine. We'll be happy to do that. I said thank you. I started talking to him. I really liked him. He seemed really nice. The other man seemed like the kind of man that comes on to every woman that crosses his path. The other man seemed like a genuinely nice man so I talked mostly to him. Then I thought, You know. I wonder if he would just take me home. I'm so tired and frustrated. Even when I talked to the women I almost cried because I was so frustrated. I realized that I would have to tell him where I live and they will probably say something like, You mean you got all the way over here from there on your bicycle? But I just thought how much I really wanted to go home. I was going to ask him if he could just take me home."
"0697"	"(2003-10-26)"	"Something to do with the CAS office."
"0698"	"(2003-10-27)"	"I was working for a company that the first part of my job, maybe to get started working for this company, I had to see a certain number of people and present this photography package to them. I wasn't expected to sell any of them but I had to present them. One of the places I went to present was in St. Joe. I decided to go to Cliff S's house. It looked different than it does in waking life. They had a long sidewalk that came all the way out to the edge of the road. It seems that I was walking. I think I saw somebody outside across the street. I said something about going to Cliff S's house. I think they suggested against it but I decided to go anyway and see if they would allow me to present to them. They invited me in and were going to allow me to make my presentation. Mother and Daddy were either there already or they came over or maybe they came with me. Sc's had me go into the living room and wait for them. They said they would be right in. They had a lot of family photos all over the room. I was looking for a current one in particular because I was curious as to what Cliff S looks like these days. I saw one and thought that he had aged well, that he was an attractive man. They came in and we were talking a bit about their children. There was a young man there named Simon. He was twenty something with very blonde hair. It was one of their children. He walked out of the room and I said, I know how old Simon is but it's hard for me to see him and believe that he's that old because I remember him when he was just a toddler. I was doing my presentation. With Daddy being the entertainer that he likes to be kept making jokes and wisecracks. I was getting really frustrated. Even though I knew I didn't have to sell any of these it would have been nice if I could. But he just kept joking around and stuff and I ended up not selling anything. After that I feel like I was asleep yet I was thinking about Cliff S and back to grade school and his interest in me and the way I was so shy and afraid to reciprocate any interest. I was wondering what it would have been like if I had been brave enough to go out with him. It was eighth grade and it would have been a date with his family. I didn't even ask my parents if I could go."
"0699"	"(2003-10-27)"	"I was in a hotel. I was sharing a room with three friends. One of them was Jo V. Someone had chained us up. There was a man named David [unknown in waking life] . He had thick long dark hair and dark eyes. He was very attractive. He was trying to talk our captor into letting us go. He wanted to make love to me. We were laying on a bed and we were kissing. He wanted us to take the shackle off of my ankle. I managed to get loose and we got away. We did make love. When it was time to go home I didn't want to leave and I didn't want him to leave. I had fallen in love with him. I hugged him and he picked me up off the floor. We hugged very tightly. I told him I didn't want to leave. It was at that point that I realized he had no attachment to me at all. He didn't seem at all bothered by the fact that I was leaving. He was saying that I didn't want to be involved with someone like him. Maybe he even had some kind of bad history - criminal history of some kind. I was staying on the 32nd floor of this hotel. A couple of times I got on the service elevator. I was trying to get back to my room. I was on the 11th floor. It was a very small elevator. It probably didn't have room for more than three or four people. It was very unusual in the way it operated. When I was already back to the 32nd floor it stopped. As I was getting ready to get off it went up a little further, then it dropped back down a little past the 32nd floor and then back up to where it should be for me to get off. There were a bunch of people standing there waiting to get on. I went back to the room. My roommates were all packing and getting us ready to leave. They hadn't packed my stuff but they had put it all together. I walked out of the room. There were a lot of other people in the hotel that we knew. I saw Terri O come out of her room. She was getting ready to leave as well. Towards the end of the day it seemed as though someone had done some investigation or something of David. It seemed to be that he was connected to Daniel R or Nick R. I'm not sure which. One of them had given them my name as someone he could sleep with easily, be intimate with. I was so furious. When I went and tried to find out if he knew Daniel R, I think it was Daniel R, he denied knowing anyone by that name. A little bit later, I was doing some other packing but I wasn't in the room at the time. Maybe I was just consolidating some things that I had already packed and trying to make things easier to carry. He came up and sat down next to me. I didn't want to have anything to do with him at that point. I had nothing to say. It was as though he wanted to talk to me about this but yet didn't know what to say. I was sitting there. I had two bags of turkey deli meat in clear plastic bags. They were each slices that were rolled up. I was combining them into one bag. I had no desire to talk to David. I woke up at one and then went back to sleep. We were on a beach and there was a huge wave. It scared the heck out of me because I thought as it was coming into the beach that it was going to go right over my head and completely put me under water. Fortunately it didn't. It did cover some people, but it's height diminished before it reached me. It washed way up on the beach beyond where I was standing, but it wasn't any deeper than my knees."
"0700"	"(2003-10-30)"	"I was at SVH but not as a patient or an employee. I don't know why I was there but I was with someone. We ran into Doctor B. He spoke very briefly with the person that I was with and did little more than acknowledge me. I was a little confused, hurt, or disappointed by that. It seemed unusual because Doctor C often said that Doctor B spoke highly of me. Later I was by myself and ran into Doctor C. I was surprised to see him. I said, What are you doing here? It's Thursday afternoon. You should be golfing. He said, I know. He was not as upset as I expected him to be with working on a Thursday afternoon instead of golfing. He did say something about not being happy about it. There was also something about the sleep center staff. We weren't actually at the sleep center but maybe some or all of the staff were at the hospital in a meeting or training room for something going on there."
"0701"	"(2003-11-05)"	"I was standing right inside the window of one room and Bill C was standing inside the window of another room. The room that he was in was a bathroom. He had just gotten out of the shower so he didn't have any clothes on. He looked different than in waking life. He was much heavier and even in the face didn't look the same. We saw each other standing inside the window so he called out of the window from the room he was in and through the window of the room where I was. But then we saw in a distance that Jane C was there. So we got concerned and he quickly went back. Tried to quickly get back without her seeing us. I guess maybe she was headed towards us. She didn't catch us. The place where we lived was my home now in waking life. I had come home and the front door was open. But it looked like something was going on next door also. I wondered if they were getting it ready for someone new to move in. It looked like they had put black blinds on the windows. I noticed those and thought how nice they looked. But my front door was standing open. I hesitated at the door trying to decide whether to go in or not. I realized that it was the maintenance men that were in there. They had brought in a lot of equipment. You can hardly even get into the kitchen. At some point I wondered if I was finally getting my new windows but I don't think that's what they were doing. There were a lot more than the 3 or 4 maintenance men that work here in waking life. Tim U is the only one I recall from waking life. Maybe the other men were subcontractors. As soon as they saw me they realized that they had forgotten to put plastic down on the carpet before they started coming in and out and working there. As a result there were black footprints all over the carpet. They quickly started putting something down on the carpet. They put some of it down on top of the black footprints. Now Jane C either came in or was there and I just noticed her. She was using a vacuum and cleaning up the black stuff on the carpet. We were trying to figure out how to get rid of these clones of us. We decided that we needed to use a time machine and travel back in time. We realized that the three of us needed to travel together. Myself and whoever I was married to and our daughter. We would go back to a period in time that we had visited previously and created this clone, we went back to that period of time. We would find them and not tell them why we were there. I don't know that they even realized that we were clones or that we were from a different time or anything. We had to come up with a reason to get all three of them in the same room and standing next to each and very close to us. As soon as we did that something happened that took a second and they just disappeared. Whatever we did took a split second and they disappeared. It seemed that there were a lot of different ones all in one time period. It was almost as though we realized that all of the clones existed in one time period and we realized that we could get rid of all of them at once if we could get them all in the same room at one time. So we had done this but we also realized this time that some of the clones looked very different. Like the teenage daughter in one of these clone families looked like a very old woman and she was maybe only 3 feet tall. She had shoulder length, full, grey hair. In the face looked like an old woman. The way she walked and carried herself was very much like an old woman. She is the only one that I remember specifics about the differences in appearance. It was at that point, where we had gotten them all in the room together, and we started making them disappear one family at a time. We were doing quickly enough that it didn't cause a problem."
"0702"	"(2003-11-07)"	"Matthew had gotten a dog for Ashley B. It looked just like Belle. Not full grown but maybe just a few months old. Not a puppy either. Ashley B had just had a baby. We were at home but our home looked different than in it does in waking life. He and a friend left and without asking me just left the dog there with me. There were also seeking permission from the city or something to cut a tree down outside the house for some reason because of the dog. I was upset because I didn't want the tree cut down. But also because they didn't ask me about any of this before he did it. At some point Darren H and Annie H showed up but I'm not sure why. I remember thinking that Annie H looked a lot younger than she does in waking life."
"0703"	"(2003-11-08)"	"I was a member of some branch of the armed forces. I have no idea or what branch or where I was serving. We were in a thing that looked kind of like a big building - almost like an empty warehouse. There was nothing in it. There were bare boards on the ceiling. A bunch of us had gone into this building. Shortly after we got in there we realized it was sitting on some swamp land or something so it started sinking. We weren't able to leave so we were trying to do other things to try to get to the roof, or to try to keep ourselves safe until someone got there to rescue us. I was hanging on to one of the bare boards on the ceiling. I wasn't just holding on to it with my hands but also had my legs wrapped around it and kind of hanging there. When I realized that wouldn't work much longer I noticed a window or opening of some kind on the wall near me. I managed to get the window opened out by the latch. I was able to pull myself out and onto the roof. I was able to survive that way. Myself and another woman survived. I don't know if anyone else survived or not. Because we survived this ordeal we were being given honorable discharge. I was excited to find out that I was going to be able to go home early. There was something about one year but I don't know what that had to do with it. We were back where we were living or staying. It wasn't like an army barrack. It was more like individual houses or apartments. This other woman had survived, I think maybe she was married or involved with someone. She was anxiously awaiting the return of her partner. She had taken a shower. She had long black hair. She came over to my house right after her shower. Her hair was still wet. She said something about having a party. Maybe jokingly said that everyone had to come to the party naked. Later her and I are talking to a couple of men. One in particular I seemed to be getting along especially well with. I think I invited him to this party. He said there was no way he could go to a party where he had to show up naked or where everyone would be naked. I had somehow convinced him to come anyway. We kissed. It wasn't a long romantic kiss. He was sitting in a lounge chair and I just leaned over and gave him a quick kiss on the lips. Later, I saw him coming to the party and it turned out that it wasn't that we had to show up naked. I saw this man coming and he had a T-shirt on but no pants. I ran out to warn him so he could go home and finish dressing. He went back and finished getting dressed. I think he was younger than I was. Maybe this is why a romantic relationship didn't even occur to me. But we did get along really well. I really enjoyed talking to him. Somehow the idea of romance came up. I started entertaining the thought simply because of the way we got along. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be romantically involved with someone younger than myself. I don't know how much younger he was, if it was significant or anything."
"0704"	"(2003-11-10)"	"Something to do with computer work and pulling up a lot of files that had some kind of supporting data for the name file. That's the best way that I can describe it. There were a lot of them. I don't know if it was me doing the work or someone else. Going through them one at a time. At the end it seemed to be meaningless. This was sketchy and hard to explain."
"0705"	"(2003-11-10)"	"There were a lot of characters. Ben D was one of them. He asked me to marry him and I think I said yes. After we were married he was telling me certain things that he expected. My first reaction was that I should have known that before I married him because I don't know that I would have. My second reaction is that it wasn't that big of a deal and that I would be able to adapt with no big problem. But it was as though there were these, I'm trying to decide if the whole thing had something to do with SAID. It feels as though some or all of it had something to do with some kind of criminal activity. Not all of it. Just some of it. It's as though there were different, for lack of a better description, rooms or places that you would go for some reason. Each place was built. They weren't connected. They were built on the water. I think they had the capability to move. But they weren't like boats, not even like houseboats. Maybe kind of like an enclosed dock. That seems to be the closest I can come to describing them. One of them did seem to be something like a houseboat. Somehow, but I don't know how, we moved from one to the other. Almost a sense of jumping across from one to the other. Maybe they were just far enough apart that you could just step across but for some reason I felt the need to jump across. There was a child that needed to use the bathroom. I agreed to take her. It wasn't my child. I had to take her from one of these to another. I wanted to do it without being seen or caught. I don't think I was guilty of any criminal activity but maybe I was a witness. There was some kind of criminal activity or somebody that would have wanted to capture me to keep me from saying what I knew. Those people were in this one place where I had to take this child to go to the bathroom. I thought I had gotten there without being spotted. We closed the door. Just as I closed the door someone on the outside of the door did something to lock us in or to keep us from getting out. I didn't panic. As soon as it happened I started looking for alternative ways to get out. There was a very odd kind of window. It didn't open like a normal window. It didn't even really look like a window. But I identified a way that we would be able to get out through there. While I was doing this child was going to the bathroom. It was a little girl. As she finished I realized that she had been standing in something like a bathtub or shower stall going to the bathroom. As she did this the water level in the toilet was rising. This is so odd. I asked her why she did that but I don't remember her answer. She didn't get her shoes wet or anything doing this. As soon as she finished we flushed the toilet and everything was fine. It's as though we did this twice. I can't remember how it was different the second time or enough to give a description that makes more sense."
"0706"	"(2003-11-14)"	"I had decided to purchase a condominium. I think I found one advertised in a large hardback book. It was about the size of a large dictionary. The community had a specific name so I got out a map and looked up the name. The weird thing is that it described it but it was also the name of the community. I went there and walked into a sales office. There was a woman working there that was about my age or maybe a little older. She was very thin, had blonde hair and wore glasses. She was the only one working. Initially she didn't say anything to me though she had glanced up at me but then kept working. Finally she did look up. I told her I was there to look into the condo that was for sale. She got her keys and took me to see it. I think we just walked. At first I was unsure. We had to go upstairs to enter the front door. She was telling me that my neighbor was an older woman with MS. She said I would hardly ever see her but that there is one person who comes frequently to see her and help to care for her. I would see that person but otherwise she was a good neighbor because she is quiet and does not have a lot of people coming in and out etc. Where you enter was kind of like a covered patio outdoor area. There was a sitting area. It had some roses there that were dying. I thought I could try to save the roses. I thought it would be a nice area to sit and read and such. The woman then showed me another area. We looked over or through or something to an area that was an outdoor area that was not covered. It seems as though we had to look through some wood slats to see this area. This area was about the size of a car. The floor was wood and not level. It had a high slope. I couldn't figure out what it was and I don't remember what she told me. Underneath it was storage and she said a basement. I asked her if I could see it. She told me I could but we went inside first. As soon as we walked in the front door I knew it was the place that I wanted though right now I can't remember anything about the inside or why I knew it was the place for me. She showed me around. I was carrying this big book with me that had the condo listed. I also had my checkbook and a pen with me. I set those down on the kitchen counter I think while we looked around. After we finished looking around the inside I told her I was pretty sure this was the place that I wanted but I wanted to see the basement first. There were some maintenance men there. I asked her how soon it could be available for me to move in and she said two weeks. She said the maintenance men would need that much time to get it ready. This is unusual for a condo unless the owners hired these men to do some work. One of the maintenance men was taking me to see the basement. I was wearing a somewhat short skirt. We had to go down a wall ladder. I was nervous about going down this ladder anyway but especially in this short skirt. He went down first and then held out his hand to help me down. I think I handed him my book and checkbook and pen. Then I went down. I remember asking someone or saying to someone that it didn't seem that there were many families with small children in the community. They smiled and chuckled and said no there weren't families with young children in the community. They said it was mostly people my age and ten or 15 years younger or older. Someone asked me about my son. I said he was 18 and I told him he was a student at PLU. I don't know if I said he was a junior."
"0707"	"(2003-11-15)"	"Matthew and a new girlfriend. It almost seemed as though I, and maybe someone else was trying to rescue him from something or maybe this girl and we had to get him away from campus. I think we believed that Michelle [unknown in waking life] was going to do physical harm to Matthew if he left. Chris H was there. At one point it seemed that I was observing and someone else was the mom. The mom had gotten a job as a housekeeper in the sorority house that the new girlfriend, Michelle, belonged to. She did this to have access to cause some type of problem. She was in a room with several of the girls and sprayed something on them and into Michelle's eyes. She than ran to escape the house. They announced an alert over a PA system. This was to lock down or stop the mom from escaping. Some of the girls didn't know who they were trying to prevent from escaping and it did not occur to them that it was the housekeeper. As the mom reached the front door there were three girls there locking the door and saying something about the escapee not being able to get out that way. It was a very nice, expensive house. The front door was a beautiful dark wood with a window pane running vertical alongside the door. Since they did not expect the housekeeper to be the one they were trying to prevent from leaving they let her out. As soon as she got out she ran for a car that was waiting for her. There were a lot of people in the car and they had created a disturbance around the car to make it easier for them to get away. There were also a lot of people outside the car to help with the escape. Some ran behind and hung on to the back of the car as it pulled away so no one would be able to get a license plate number. It seems that maybe they even started a fire. As the car drove off we drove into tons of traffic. We were worried that they would be able to catch us now, but then we realized that my significant other had arranged this for me to help with the escape because as we drove all of the traffic moved out of our way and then back into place to prevent anyone from getting to us by following us. The cars that were moving were sitting at all types of angles and directions which made it seem more impossible for anyone to get through. There were also people standing along the road cheering us on because they wanted us to be able to get away. I ended up alone at a bus or train station. I thought it was a bus station but the ground area somewhat resembled train tracks or a train station. I don't know what happened to the other people who had been in the car with me and I don't know what I did with the car. I was trying to figure out how to get home from there, but with my car. I didn't want to take the bus/train. I was trying to decide if I could/should ask someone at the station and if so, who. It seems that I did but they either couldn't tell me how to get home or told me that I had to take the bus/train. During the rerun of this part of the dream someone gave me directions and I was with someone but I don't know who. They drove from there. We came to a part of the road that was completely under water. I could see not far up ahead that the water was very active and it looked as though we would be driving off the edge of something. I was scared and brought it to the attention of the driver. By that time it was too late but it turned out we just couldn't see beyond that point - not that it was a drop off. We kept driving through the water and made our escape. I don't think Matthew was with us though. In another rerun of this part of the dream it did drop off and I don't remember anything beyond that. In the first run of this part of the dream, when they told me I couldn't drive away from the station they did give me some kind of directions. This time Matthew was either there or showed up, with a male friend. We followed the directions given to us. We came to this area where the ground area looked like a huge wooden slide with several lanes. Almost like a six or eight lane highway but they were varnished wood lanes to a slide. People sat and slid to the end. Along the right side there was also a chain link fence and a cement walkway. Some people chose to walk down this path. It was a little difficult to walk because it was so steep - difficult like it would be if you were trying to walk down a steep hillside. I think I decided to walk and Matthew and his friend were sliding down. I was keeping up with them to a point and then I seemed to get ahead of them. I lost sight of them at one point and became very frightened that something had happened to them. They finally showed up at the end. At the end of this path there were some people from the college working. The student mailboxes were there also - they looked like regular house mailboxes, black metal. I opened Matthew's and looked in. There were lots of messages for him written on sticky notes. There was one larger one that was to stay in the mailbox at all times. It was kind of stuck to the mailbox so it hung down in front when you opened it. You removed it to remove the rest of the mail and then you put it back. There was a young man who removed it while I took the rest of the mail/messages out and then he put it back and closed the box. I was looking at the notes and then passing them on to Matthew. I think some of them were either from or about Michelle. Maybe there were some of each. There was also a female attendant there. She was responsible for some metal boxes that we had to put change into. Before we could leave or move on. We had a pile of change that we were talking about or doing something with when we realized that some of it had to go into this metal box before we left. It needed a quarter and something else. There was also something about Ashley B. This seems as though another rerun part of this dream where just parts of the dream occurred more than once but in slightly different ways. The escape to the car was one of those but I can't capture the details now. We were in a room and Chris H was lying down. He must have been lying on the floor because I needed to get around him and warned him so I wouldn't step on him as I stepped over and around him to get what I needed. He moved a little and at first I thought I was going to lose my balance or step on him because of that."
"0708"	"(2003-11-15)"	"I was in my home study and doing some cleaning or organizing. It didn't look like my study in waking life. It was much larger and had maybe eight filing cabinets, some two drawer and some four. Some were wider than they were deep. I was thinking about ways that I could rearrange all of these cabinets so I would have more space. The way some of them were sitting now it created a big empty space behind them - they were sitting in an L shape. As I was doing this I kept finding drawers full of office supplies. On some of the two drawer filing cabinets I had plastic file boxes with two or three drawers each, sitting on top. You could see into those as they were clear on the front and side with colored tops and frames. These also had tons of office supplies in them. Matthew came in and I was showing him all of these office supplies that I had. Apparently I had accumulated them because every time I needed something I went out and bought it, buying a few extra to have on hand, and forgetting that I already had some on hand in the study. I told Matthew I thought I was going to box them all up and give them away to an organization in the fall - an organization that collects school supplies for needy children. He thought too this was a good idea. Mother and Daddy came to visit. My home was at the top of a steep hill. It was winter and there was snow and ice on the street and driveway. They were in a van and I saw them come up the hill and then go back down and park at the bottom of the hill. Daddy had a difficult time finding a place that he could safely walk up the hill. I wondered why they didn't park at the top of the hill near my door, but then realized that there were no guest parking spaces there. I did then realize, however, that there were two handicap spaces but they had too much snow piled in them to be able to park there. I went to the office, which in this case almost seemed to be an outdoor office and the woman working there was behind a large glass partition. There was a small window hole in the glass to speak to her through. I asked her if she could have the handicap spaces cleared in the future. A little later I realized she had someone come and clear them right away. I suggested that Mother and Daddy go ahead and move their van into one of the spaces right away. Daddy wanted to walk down the hill so I went with him. Walking down was more dangerous because of the ice and snow. I identified a place along the hill that was shaped somewhat like steps. It had snow on it but it was safer than the icy walkway. So he stepped onto that and began making his way down. We got to a point where he had to step back down onto the walkway. It was a pretty tall step down however. I held out my left hand to help him balance and keep him from falling as he stepped down. I realized this was the hand that had been hurting so much and couldn't support any weight but I went ahead and used it anyway. Back in the house I found a few drawers that had Halloween costumes in them. One had several rubber masks in it. I pulled one out that was purple and lime green. I showed it to Daddy and told him that it matched what he was wearing that day. He had on a one piece something that was purple and lime green. It looked like it could be worn as a Halloween costume though that was not it's intended use. Daddy tried the mask on. I was watching him trying on, I don't know that anyone else was paying attention. It was a tight fit and I was becoming concerned that he was going to suffocate. He was having trouble finding the front of the mask where he could breath through this mouth and nose and see. I realized that the mask had faces on both the front and back. I reached down with my right hand, I think Daddy was sitting at this point, and tried to move it around to help him find the face holes. I got them in the right position but then realized there was a liner on the inside that was out of place and blocking all of the holes. I finally, and gently, slid the mask off of his head. I told him I didn't think it was a good idea for him to borrow that one. He agreed that he did not want to borrow that one but we did find another that he could borrow. I checked with Matthew to be sure he wasn't planning to use any of them between now and the next Halloween, because Halloween had just passed. He said he wouldn't."
"0709"	"(2003-11-15)"	"I was at some kind of family event. Bruce W and Carl W were both there. I was talking to Carl W and telling him how nice it was to see him since he never gets to family reunions. I was saying something about him still being single, which he isn't in waking life, and he reminded me that he was married and that it was Bruce W that was still single. I was thinking about having an attraction to Bruce W and that I was glad or something that he was still single. However, I quickly thought how inappropriate it was to be attracted to him as he is my first cousin. I think, though, that the attraction was mutual."
"0710"	"(2003-11-15)"	"I was at a CIIS intensive. Jo V and I were checking in at the same time and had taken our luggage upstairs. To get to the room upstairs you had to walk across a very narrow walkway that seemed to drop off to the left. There didn't seem to be a rail or a wall there. The floor was hardwood. The wall to the right was a row of windows. The ceiling was less than five feet high so I had to bend over to go across the walkway. There were also hanging plants every so often that I had to dodge. We learned that our room was actually downstairs so we went back down. For some reason Ben D was there. I heard that he was wondering why I was avoiding him or not giving him any special attention. I thought to myself that it was a two-way street. He could pay special attention to me and didn't. He hadn't initiated any communication in months so why should I pay special attention to him? Later we were at a group meeting and Liz C, came in riding in a very small motorized race car that was primarily blue in color. I thought it was great. She was using this as an alternative to the scooters that many people use when they have limited mobility. I was thinking that she traded in her wheelchair for this. But she did get up and move around some once she arrived at the meeting. Each day two or three of us were supposed to facilitate or lead a group exercise, meditation or prepared. I was excited about the one I had prepared. When it came time for me to facilitate my exercise, someone else in the group arbitrarily decided we didn't have time and got majority agreement to postpone it until another time, but there wasn't another time for me to do it. I was somewhat upset by this. I felt it was disrespectful yet didn't surprise me. Later that day Liz C and someone else were sitting on the steps, in looked like my home now, and talking about the fact that everyone seemed to be greatly lacking in motivation. Liz C asked me what I thought about it. I said I had missed most of that evening's meeting due to my lack of motivation. I didn't mention what had happened. She asked me to go upstairs with her and help her come up with something that might improve motivation. I agreed, though I wasn't sure I was the best person to help her. Later I was in my bedroom, again it seems that I am at home, and Bill C came to the door and asked if he could step in and talk to me. I said yes. He was speaking in a very low voice so as not to be overheard. I was having trouble hearing him so I asked if I could close the door. He hesitated for a moment because it would be inappropriate for he and I to be in my bedroom alone with the door closed. I agreed. What might others think if they knew? However, since we both knew it was totally innocent we closed the door anyway. We talked for just a few minutes. We were in a mode where we were really connecting, laughing and enjoying our conversation as occasionally happens. A couple of times he stepped very close to me as we talked. I found myself having a desire to kiss him, or for him to kiss me, and felt the same coming from him though he didn't say it. I knew we wouldn't because we both knew it would be inappropriate. Still, I was disappointed when he left the room. In another scene I am sitting at a small square table talking to Audrey T. She was trying to talk her office landlord into creating a courtyard for tenants. I had told her some time ago that our office building had something like this and I had talked them into fixing it up for tenants to use. We could go out there and sit in quiet, to have lunch, or to have a conversation with someone. So far Audrey T was being unsuccessful and wanted to know if I had any suggestions. Bill C came up and sat down. I introduced him to Audrey T. I started to explain what she does for a living but admitted that I could not do that very well so asked her to explain to him what she does. I was expecting her to tell him about her work with women and unions but she didn't. When I said something about that she said that she hasn't been doing that forever. I was embarrassed that I didn't know that."
"0711"	"(2003-11-16)"	"I was helping someone organize their office. I had divided all of their paperwork into three piles. One was ready to file. One was trash. The other was things I didn't know what to do with. I had highlighted the boxes or something of the ones I didn't know what to do with."
"0712"	"(2003-11-16)"	"Matthew came home and told me that he and Ashley B were officially going steady."
"0713"	"(2003-11-17)"	"I was at John Mu's house. He and his wife were in bed. He motioned me to come into his bedroom. Their bed was the width of a twin size bed but the length of two beds. They were sleeping feet-to-feet. I didn't even realize that she was in the bed until he started to introduce me to her and she poked her head out from under the blanket. They invited me to stay. We were in the living room watching a movie. He and his wife and I. He sat really close to me, right next to my left side. It made me very uncomfortable. His wife got up and left but I don't know where she went. Then he tried to get even cozier. Maybe he leaned his head against me. We were eating popcorn. I think I was trying to be nice to make up for the bad parting that we had in waking life. I had my hand interlaced in his arm. I was surprised when I realized that my head was leaning against his shoulder. I moved immediately. It was dark in the room. I could tell he was getting ready to reach over and put his hand on my leg or knee. I was getting very squeamish because I did not want him to touch me. He reached over and I gently pushed his hand away. I was wearing a skirt. He said, Oh come on. It's not like I'm going to reach all the way up or anything. I was still trying to be nice so I smiled and said, Sorry. I don't do that. He tried again and I pushed his hand away again. Then four children came in. Two of the teenage girls, with blonde hair, were his daughters. The one teenager was a boy and then there was a younger girl. He introduced me to them. They started watching the movie with us. The youngest one had long dark hair. I think I playfully tossed a pillow at her and it landed on her stomach. She got really upset. I apologized. I crouched down over her. She was lying on the sofa. She said she didn't feel good. I said again how sorry I was. She started crying. John went to do something and I just decided that it was time for me to leave. I picked up my purse but I didn't think I should leave without saying anything to him. As soon as he came back in the room I told him that I thought it was time for me to go. He started to protest and I just said, No. I really need to go. When I went to leave I saw my car was covered with a heavy layer of white dust or dirt. I think earlier we or someone had been doing yardwork and it was from the yardwork. I was parallel parked in the driveway between two other cars. I opened the driver's side door very carefully so all of this stuff wouldn't get in the car. I shut the door and started the engine. I was revving the engine really hard to blow all of this white dust off so I could see to drive. As I did this it shook the car a lot, enough to move it in a position where I could easily drive away. John came out and was going to try to stop me but I pulled away. It seemed that he and I worked for the same large company. I had a discussion with the owner of the company. It had nothing to do with John. I think it had to do with an idea that I had for the business. He kind of liked the idea and had suggested that I handle a certain part of the project. A couple of other people were standing there and questioning why I would want to do this. I was said a couple of times, No. I would like to finally be recognized for being the one responsible for this. I didn't come right out and say it or was hinting at the fact that at previous companies I had made significant contributions that really benefited the company but other people got credit for it. So this time I wanted to do it again and I wanted to get credit for it. I don't think that was the only reason I wanted to do it though. There was a rumor going around. A lot of employees were getting worried that they were going to lose their jobs. It was in some way related to this idea I proposed. It wasn't true but the rumor got started and everyone was getting worried. John was one of them. He was still kind of after me. The owner found out about that and was trying to help me. Maybe he was trying to protect me or keep John away from me. I was now maybe back at John's house and I was trying to get out without him seeing me. He would spot me and come running after me. I kept trying to hide and get away from him or stay far enough away that he couldn't touch me or anything. The owner of the company showed up and was doing something to try to help me. I smelled incense and realized that the owner of the company had lit this incense because it was in some way supposed to help me or keep John away from me. The owner of the company told me that he loved me. That made me very happy. I don't know that I said the same to him. The next thing that I remember is that it seemed as though there was a flood. It was as though you were looking at an ocean where you couldn't see beyond the horizon. There was a long boat. It was not a good thing. John threatened or in danger. He said, Oh. What the heck. I'm going to go ahead and get on that huge penis-shaped boat."
"0714"	"(2003-11-17)"	"I was in the office working with Bill C. We were talking about something very personal. We are now employees at a hospital. He has a discussion with someone about how easy it is for him to access someone else's sperm. So he was going to make sure I got pregnant by someone else's sperm. I had called and was having a fun conversation with him on the phone. He didn't know it was me and was getting a little upset. I finally said, I'm teasing you. It's me. Right after that he tells me that he loves me and that he is perfectly okay with that. I tell him that I love him too. He is in an accident or something and ends up as a patient in the hospital. I was frantically trying to find Bill C. I did find him and he was being treated. He had a tube down his throat, a neck brace, and all kinds of other paraphernalia on and around him. I got as close as I could to his face and spoke to him. He looked at me but couldn't speak because of the tubes and things. Now it seems that instead of Bill C and me it is David Letterman and someone else. There are some other people now and they are conspiring against the woman that David is involved with. David is wearing something that looks like coveralls and lying on a loft type bed. He is lying there with someone else - a woman. Someone has placed them both there as part of a conspiracy. They get into an argument and fall off the bed. They just fall maybe ten feet to another loft bed. The same thing happens again. Now there is a third person lying on the loft bed below them. Now all three of them fall. I think as the top two fall they knock the lower one off. That person falls a far distance and gets seriously hurt. Maybe more than one of them. I'm not sure it is David or not. I'm also somewhat confused, but don't know why, as to whether it is David or if it is Bill C. Next I am with Diane S. I'm trying to make or keep her OK or feel better. We're staying at an event and we know a lot of people at this event."
"0715"	"(2003-11-17)"	"Mother is in the hospital. She looks different than in waking life. I think several of us children were there but decided that only one of us needed to be there at a time. I was going to stay first. Whoever was the last to leave said if I needed anything that I should call Bev first since she lives the closest. There was also something about getting a wheelchair and taking her outside and something about some other patients."
"0716"	"(2003-11-17)"	"I was putting up my outdoor Christmas decorations. The outside of my house looked different than in waking life. As I was starting I either thought or said that I knew exactly how I wanted to do it. Once I got started I said I didn't know how I wanted it. I think I had an extension cord out but no lights. I was trying to figure out where to put the Nativity scene. I didn't want the lights from it to bother any of the neighbors. I was also trying to decide if I wanted it in the front yard where my neighbors might enjoy it most or if I wanted to put it on my patio where I would enjoy it most. It seems that I had left some of the figures standing all year because I pulled them out of the ground. As I was doing that I noticed there were small, white, porcelain angel figurines that had gotten buried in the dirt. There were two or three of them. They had each gotten buried separately but in a row."
"0717"	"(2003-11-18)"	"Mother and Daddy were building a new home. The house was an L-shape. The bottom of the L was to the right of the house it came out to the front and that's where the garage was. It had double garage doors, on the left side of the L. You had to pull across the front of the house to pull into the garage. Very odd. I was inside the new part of the house with Brian F, I think. It was framed. I think they were starting to work on the kitchen. I was talking about when they were going to move in. It seems that the new house was on the same property as the current house so they were going to move in one room at a time. As one room was finished they were going to move in to it. So they were moving into the kitchen first. They were using some of the kitchen cabinets from the current house in the new house. Brian F was talking about being excited about moving in. I made the comment that I had no intention of moving in this new house. He was put off by this and didn't understand. I'm not sure why I was so adamant about not moving in this new house."
"0718"	"(2003-11-18)"	"I'm in a warehouse. There are a number of people there working. One of them is Marcia N. Some workers are coming in and asking me and someone else some questions. Marcia N and some of the others are angry because the workers are asking me and because I'm answering them. Now I'm getting upset because I really don't even want to have anything to do with any of it. I'm not guessing on my answers. If I don't know I'm telling them to go ask someone that I know will know the correct answers. Marcia N and these other people are upset because they think we're answering questions that we really don't know the answers too. There is something else about a parade. It might be more than one parade. There are these things, kind of like the large balloons they have in the Thanksgiving Day parade. Only these are made of fabric. I think I may have been responsible for one of them and one of them broke or tore or got damaged and it wasn't my fault. Yet, these employees were blaming me and someone else was defending me and trying to explain that it wasn't really my fault."
"0719"	"(2003-11-19)"	"Someone was getting married. I think it was Jennifer K. I was a bridesmaid. We were running late. We didn't get to the church until five minutes before the wedding was to begin. We weren't even dressed yet."
"0720"	"(2003-11-20)"	"I was at BJ's house for some kind of family event. Mike A was going to be attending. She was concerned that she didn't have enough ice. Brian F said he would run to the nearest store and buy some. She said that wouldn't do because Mike doesn't like that kind of ice. Then Brian F suggested we put her ice in a separate bowl for Mike A to use and the rest of us could use the bought ice. She still wasn't sure. I told her that I agree with Brian F. I went with him to buy the ice. There was something else that we had to do while we were getting the ice. It had something to do with a dog named Appleby. I think John S and someone else went with us also. Maybe Bev. We went to this place. It's like Brian F had rented this dog and we were returning it. We were walking down an aisle trying to find Appleby's spot so to speak. They were wooden shelves that had wooden partitions. On the back wall behind the shelf they had their names painted in very decorative lettering with pictures and such. We finally found Appleby's. Brian F laid a credit card there to pay for whatever it was. I thought that was very odd that he was comfortable just laying his credit card there and leaving it. I don't know how or when he was going to get it back. I got out my wallet to see if I had enough cash. It was $16 and I had exactly that. I gave it to Brian F so he could leave that instead of his credit card. Now I'm there alone at the front desk. I was talking to someone. She needed $8.80 plus tax. I only had $8.80 so I called BJ's house to see if someone could come with the rest of the cash that I needed for whatever it was I was doing for them. BJ and Jody S showed up with the rest of the cash. The receipt had fallen on the ground. It had manure on it. No one wanted to pick it up so we were kicking the manure so we could read the receipt. The woman who worked there finally took a couple of swipes at it to knock it into a position where we could finally read it. I told BJ and Jody S that someone was going to need to come back in a couple of days but I don't know why. I don't know what it was we were paying for. We went back to the house. Mike A showed up. I was outside with BJ when he showed up. The three of us went inside. I was observing him. I couldn't believe how different he seemed. BJ thought it was just an act. I wasn't sure. I just kept watching him and wondering if he was sincere or if it was an act or a temporary thing."
"0721"	"(2003-11-20)"	"I was at the CAS office. Bill C and I were trying to arrange a work session. He asked me if I wanted to have a working lunch. I said, Yes, I'd love that."
"0722"	"(2003-11-21)"	"I was working at the CAS office. I was working on something related to curriculum. I thought it would be important, after completing it, to sit down with the instructors to tweak it. I had completed the draft and realized that while I didn't know if Bill C would be the one presenting the training I thought I would go over it with him. He was in his office but the lights were either off or very low. He had come into my office. I had piles of paper neatly spread out but covering my desk. I handed this document to him and said something to him about it. He got angry and said, I told you I wanted you to work on _____ - something else but I don't remember now what - and that I just wanted you to concentrate on that. I said, I had been and I just needed break so I worked on something else for a little bit. He just walked out. I was very upset about it. It was in the afternoon and people started arriving for a training program. I went down to the Deli because I hadn't had lunch yet. I stopped at the women room on the way. I was talking to two other women in there. They were both single. We were talking about going somewhere. Someone said something about men. The women room was a huge room. At the other end of the room was another room and her husband was with her. They said something like, Now wait a minute. And then said something about talking about men that way. I said I wasn't generalizing that I was talking about a few specifically from my experience. Myself and another woman left and we went down to the deli. Someone there asked if he could help me. I said I wanted a turkey sandwich. He brought me this very large round platter. He had a lot of tomatoes and onions and lettuce and a pickle. I thought, Oh wow. I should have told him that I wanted this to go. I started digging through the pile of tomatoes and found the turkey. Then I thought I needed to go ask him for some bread because I didn't tell them that I wanted it to go. As I continued to dig I found one round piece of bread, like half of a bun. Then I found another that would be the middle slice of a three-part bun. I finally decided that was good enough, that I would make my sandwich out of that. I wanted something to drink. Since I was upset I decided to get a regular Sprite. Before I left I had dug through my purse to get a bunch of quarters to pay for it. I realized that they had made a lot of changes in the deli - maybe even different ownership. Now instead of the soda machines that they used to have they had one soda machine that dispensed cups of soft drinks with ice. I went ahead and put my quarters in. I saw they had diet Sprite so I chose that. As I saw it coming out I suspected that it was Mountain Dew rather than Sprite. I took one sip and could tell that it was definitely Mountain Dew. I got a little anxious because I know how little Mountain Dew it takes to affect my nervous system. I told whoever was with me that I had to go up to the counter and get this taken care of. I went and told one of the women working there what had happened and that I could not drink Mountain Dew. They wanted me to just be okay with the Mountain Dew. I told them that I really couldn't because it would have such a strong negative affect on my nervous system. I really couldn't handle it physically. They said something to a young man working there to have him taking care of it. The deli was really crowded. There were a lot of tables. It was much larger and much busier than in waking life. There were people at every table; there was a long line of people in the food line. As I was standing there, there were many desserts there and they looked very tempting. I thought that I needed to get away from there so I wouldn't indulge. There was another man there that worked in the building. He was wearing a white shirt and tie. He was saying something to me, looking around the room. There were a lot of men in the room, all wearing white shirts and ties. He said something about all these men dressed alike - something about the mentality of it is the best way I can describe it."
"0723"	"(2003-11-22)"	"I was offered a job in another city. I was having incredible difficulty reaching a decision about whether to take the job and move or stay. Matthew was quite a bit younger than in waking life. We were talking about the decision just as we used to discuss decisions that affected both of us. I had finally come to the point where I thought - I just wanted to know what God wanted me to do. I had finally come to the decision that God wanted me to move. Some of my family members came to the house. Even Darren was there. Bev and Rachel S were there. I started telling them what treasures they all are to me and how much I value them and my time with them. However then I was going to tell them that I was going to take the job. Several of them had brought me cards and letters. I opened the first one and started to cry. I still thought that I should take the job. Then I started struggling with the decision. I didn't let them know that I had thought I had made the decision. Someone delivered several large bunches of white tulips that were from different people, some family. In the dream these were my favorite flower. I was struggling. I told them that I just wanted to be very clear about my decision and that I wanted mostly to do what God wants me to do. I was asking him to make it very clear to me so I would know what he wanted. At this point one of the men from the SDI, I think his name is Rob, he is a minister, suggested we say a prayer. He said a prayer aloud. At the end of the prayer I thought I was supposed to go and I started crying again. Oh, maybe this is when the tulips arrived and they were a farewell present. I said I was going to take a walk, thinking that would help clear my head so I could make the decision. Several times I thought the message was that I should go and that alone should tell me that I was supposed to go. However, also, if I keep having these serious doubts that I'm supposed to go maybe that is what is telling me that I'm supposed to stay. There was something I saw. Bev and some others were singing a song and dancing. Bev had really long hair in the dream. She was wearing a very pretty suit with a skirt, vest, and jacket. The jacket looked like a tweed. I wondered where she learned this dance. It was like a choreographed dance. I wondered where she learned it and why. I also had a suit on with a skirt. I had a pair of biking shorts on under the skirt. Jody S and Kim H saw I had the shorts on under the skirt and wondered why I was wearing them that way. They were helping me straighten my clothes because my blouse was rolling up under the skirt. I did finally decide not to take the job. Instead I was going to move into Mother and Daddy's beach house, which they don't have in waking life. It was located behind their house, almost as though their house was on one side of the block and the beach house on the other side of the block. I said that would be a good thing to be living so close to them yet in a different house."
"0724"	"(2003-11-23)"	"I and a female friend went to a week long conference. We met two men. I met Russell Crowe and her I don't know who it was that she met. He and I both had other plans that were cancelled. As he came out of one room I didn't even introduce myself, just grabbed his hand, put it on my shoulder, turned around and said let's go get some coffee. He didn't even know who I was or anything. He just smiled and followed me into a dining area. Two or three people that he knew joined us right away. They started talking to him and didn't bother to introduce themselves to me. I didn't even get to say another word to him - to introduce myself to him or anything. Some people that I knew came in so I slipped away and sat at a booth with them, right behind the booth he was sitting at. I thought I would wait until he was done with his friends and then rejoin him. For some reason I decided to leave. When I came back he was sitting with Matthew, waiting for me. I thought that was so cool. I sat down. Matthew was much younger. Matthew walked away I think. We finally got to talk just a little before we got interrupted again. He kept really making an effort to spend some time getting to know me. There was something about chocolate cream pie. I think he kept trying to get a piece for me because he thought I would really like it, but someone else kept taking it. He was just being very persistent about getting this for me. The dream involved different events of the whole week, like he and I working on projects together."
"0725"	"(2003-11-24)"	"My husband was planning to murder me. The first time I had the dream I let the whole thing play out and he was successful and it was a very frightening dream. I had escaped. I had managed to get out of the house without his knowledge. I was on the road for quite some time and then he found me, took me home, and tortured me for awhile. I escaped again. That time when he found me he killed me."

"0727"	"(2003-11-24)"	"We were traveling on 465 and getting off on a GI exit. We noticed an accident at the end of the exit ramp. It was too late to avoid going by there. I got to the end of the ramp too fast and I was worried about making the left-hand turn where the police were directing the traffic. I did make it okay. Unfortunately, they didn't have detour signs up yet so it was up to each driver to figure out the detour. At this point we are walking. I'm with Matthew. There are some other people ahead of us. Some behind us. We're all trying to figure out which way to go for a detour. We ended up back where we were. They had now cleaned up the accident and we could get through. However, now it was the hallway in my house. There was a woman behind. There were some men that were still cleaning up. This woman either wanted to get some information from me or give me some information. She walked in the room. I think it was the master bedroom. She was saying how uncomfortable she felt there. I told her that there had just been an accident there but I didn't know anything about it. She kept saying how uncomfortable she felt and that she really wanted to get out of that room. There was a picture on the wall that had some feathers on it. She made some comment about one of the feathers that was primarily royal blue but had a few white streaks in it. There were a number of people standing there and she kept talking about that feather. I finally said to a couple of people, do you want to hear where I got that feather? A couple of them said yes. I said, One day I was lying on the floor, (I pointed to a doorway between two rooms and indicated that I had been lying in that doorway across the beige carpet), so as you can see the pillowcase was white and the floor was very white. I had been taking a nap. When I woke up the blue feather was there, kind of out of the blue. Where it had come from, especially when everything around me was white, I have no idea. Uncle A was standing next to me and said something about that being very spooky. Now it became even spookier to me because this woman had something, told us some story about the significance of that feather. I'm wondering if someone was injured as a result of that accident."

"0729"	"(2003-11-25)"	"I was working for a large company and there was a team of us that was assigned a team task to look at the staff of a company as two separate teams. Each of the two teams doing this project were to come up with a list of descriptive words for one team in the company. Then we would narrow down this list of descriptive words to the top three or four. Then I think it was these top three or four words in maybe their strategic planning or maybe in coming up with some aspect of what they did or how they did it. All the descriptors would be used and considered but the top three or four would be considered essential in all decisions that were made. Then I think we also, both teams of this project, came together and looked at our list of descriptors together. I don't know why or how that was used."
"0730"	"(2003-11-27)"	"There were three couples and I have no idea who they were. One of the couples was engaged. The other couple was about to become engaged. By the end of the dream all three couples were engaged. For either one or two of the couples there was some suspicion, I think from the woman, that her mate was either not truly committed to their relationship or maybe he was seeing being unfaithful. That may be why they became engaged - so he/they could prove to their partners that they were committed."
"0731"	"(2003-11-27)"	"Something about my dissertation. Susan J and Dorothea D were both in my spiritual direction class. I had copied an article for them that I had asked them to read related to my dissertation. I think they were both going to be on my dissertation committee. I had made a copy of the proposal for Dorothea D but forgot to make one for Susan J. I told her I would make the copy and get it to her. I also told them both that if they had changed their mind or do change their mind about being on my committee because of time I certainly would understand. But it seems that maybe each of them were working on their PhD as well. We were talking about all of the technical editing. I said to them that I didn't think they should make themselves crazy about the technical editing of the proposal since we were required to hire a technical editor anyway at $25 an hour. I thought that as we were editing content, layout, and things like that, that we should make any technical corrections that we notice. Other than that we should rely on the technical editor that we are required to hire."
"0732"	"(2003-11-29)"	"I was with my lover, which I don't have in waking life. He had jet-black full hair and olive skin. He was a married man with two children - a boy and a girl. I went to the airport to go on a trip. His family was along too. The plane crashed. We were all fine."

"0734"	"(2003-11-30)"	"I was working at the CAS office. Bill C had just hired six or eight women to do clerical and secretarial work. I was concerned about the inherent dangers of growing a company too fast - hiring so many people at once. It seems that there was one woman in charge of all the others but I don't know who it was. They were all eating lunch, at their desks. there was a TV in the lobby and a silver cart with two shelves on wheels. I suggested they put the TV on the cart and move it into the break room so they could have lunch there and watch TV while they eat. I was hoping this would encourage all of them to eat in the break room rather than at their desks. I realized that they may have taken their cue to eat at their desk from me since I always have lunch at my desk. For several reasons I did not feel it was appropriate for them to eat their lunch at their desks - they don't work while they eat, they are hourly workers, we enforce breaks with them, etc. Later I was watering the plants, which I don't do in waking life, and saw that Bill C had put small water fountains in the middle of two of the plants in the lobby. I thought this was very odd and didn't particularly care for it but decided not to say anything as it wasn't that big of a deal. Since none of the water was spilling over into the plants I went ahead and watered them."
"0735"	"(2003-12-01)"	"I was a doctor, part of a surgical team. Our first step was to try to stabilize this patient so that we didn't lose them. But then our next step was to try to bring them back mentally so they wouldn't be brain dead. There was something about the importance of developing relationships with the other doctors and the other members of the surgical team and the important role that plays in serving the patients the best that we can and giving them the best possible care."
"0736"	"(2003-12-06)"	"Bill C. was conducting a meeting. I don't know who was there - if it was all staff or if it was other people. There were more people in attendance than we have staff in waking life. Jane C was there also but she looked different than in waking life. She started being critical of him in front of everyone. Apparently she felt that he had been rude or mean or something to several people and she was saying things like, Don't contact them. Don't make any attempt to speak with them. Then she got up and walked away. There was a woman sitting next to me but I don't know now who it was or if I knew her in the dream. I leaned over and whispered, I don't think they're going to last. I was implying that their marriage was in trouble. The woman said, No. I don't think so either. She said something else as to why she thought that. It seemed that maybe she thought they were already having discussions about separating."

"0739"	"(2003-12-09)"	"I was working with two people to create some kind of an Excel document in the computer. I think it had three worksheets. All the data we were putting in belonged to one person. The other person was giving us the guidelines - what needed to be in, what categories, the maximum number of entries, etc. I was trying to figure out how to take the data out of other documents and get it into Excel, through importing, cut and paste or some other. There was some confusion about what we were putting in it. There was confusion about how many entries on one. One was a list of names and addresses. The first time we did it, it didn't go in right - like in the correct column. The next time it was either the wrong list or the wrong information. We got all that figured out but saw there were too many entries and needed to cut it back. I think we were going to do a mailing. The person who owned the data was fretting because he didn't think we could cut it back as much as the other person was saying that we needed to. We were going to. We went through and starting deleting entries."

"0741"	"(2003-12-09)"	"I was driving around my mother's hometown. Like I always do in my dreams where I'm driving around my mother's hometown, I drove by Aunt P and Aunt H's house. I saw two of my cousins children. I think it was Debbie Wo and Susan W's children. They were outside the house. I had driven by the front of their house, the house was on my left. I turned left to the left side of the house. I thought since Susan W and whoever she was with wouldn't expect to see me in my mother's hometown they probably wouldn't recognize that it was me in the car. I decided not to wave and just go on by. Now I see them in this very run down apartment complex. There was a very narrow staircase on the outside of the building to the front door. This place is a mess. I think Debbie Wo and Susan W or one of them are thinking about moving in there. I think they are both single - never married and no children. I went into the apartment. There was an elderly man sitting in a rocking chair. I can't remember who else is in the apartment with me. He was a heavyset man with gray hair, tousled. I'm hearing or being told or realizing that Linda W and Dick W are separated. I keep thinking how difficult it must be for Dick W to be asked to leave his home after so many years of marriage. He is really struggling with this because he didn't want the separation. Now it seems that maybe it's him that's living in this place. Maybe this old man is Dick W. Now I'm living in this apartment complex or whatever it is. The master bedroom is very much like my waking life bedroom as far as where it is in the apartment and size and such. One day I came home, now it's a two-story townhouse just like I have in waking life, I open the door and shut off the alarm. I hear a loud noise upstairs. I'm sure there must be someone up there so I'm very frightened. I stand there for a couple of seconds and call out, Hello? Hello? I'm thinking that whoever is up there will leave, though I don't know how they could leave without going by me since they are on the second floor, or they'll answer me. Nobody answered me. I didn't hear anymore noise. I finally got up the courage to go upstairs and don't see anyone or anything. I don't know now what caused the noise and wonder if it was just my imagination. A little later I noticed that both of the windows in the master bedroom are open about 6 inches or so and the blinds are open about that far also. I'm so sure that I did not have them open. Now I know that someone was in my apartment, even though I had the alarm set. Then I'm thinking that I need to call the apartment office to see if someone from maintenance had been there. First I go to the window to close them and lower the blinds. But the blinds seem to be broken on both windows. When I turn around I realize that all of my CD's and DVD's, maybe ten of each, are all gone. I had kept them on a lower shelf of the TV stand though I don't in waking life. The blinds aren't broken but the cords had been cut. That's when I realized that someone had broken in through those windows, stolen by CD's and DVD's and that's all they got. That's what I heard earlier when I came in, them getting back out. In waking life I noticed this past summer that I can have those two windows open and still set the alarm. So I thought maybe someone could break into those two windows without setting off the alarm. I think I reported it to the police. I went back home and had a pile of forms or papers that had names and phone numbers. I decided to go through it to see if there was anything there that would help me to identify who had broken in. I found this one with a phone number that was just one digit off from another number that I had. I showed it to someone else that was with me in the apartment. I said, This is who it was. For whatever reason, I had identified that it was this person because of that phone number that was off just one digit. Like instead of it being 2226 it was 2262. They just rearranged those digits to be able to break in. Anyway, I told the police about it. They told me that was good kind of investigative work that I had thought of that, found it, and identified it. It turns out that this person lives in this same complex. Then I'm overhearing Susan W talk to this older woman who lives there in the complex as well. They are outside talking. The older woman said something about leaving to go to the store. I go up to her and say, You have to be careful. You can't be outside talking out loud about where you're going or when. I told her that my apartment had been broken into and that it had been someone who lived in the complex. They obviously had been paying enough attention to my comings and goings that they realized that every Wednesday morning I go to work."
"0742"	"(2003-12-11)"	"I was in a hotel along a beach. I had opened the sliding glass door and stepped out. I realized that I had stepped out onto an enclosed balcony that had maybe two other doors, one to the right that would prevent people from the room adjoining room from walking across your balcony and there was a door to the front that gave you access to the beach. On the left there was another hotel room but that end was not closed off. Both of these doors on the balcony were open and I had left the sliding glass door to my room open. There were some children playing and they had kicked a ball into my room. A little girl with blonde hair ran into my room to get it. She looked around my room for something else. I told her she needed to go because I needed to go back inside and get ready to go out. I went out to the other part of the hotel. It was packed with people. I was on my way someplace and had to step aside because a group of people were coming out of the restaurant towards a meeting room. As I was standing there a few of them recognized me. They were very excited to see me. They hugged me. They were both male and female. I recognized them as a DCC class that I started with as a Graduate Assistant and then realized that I just could not manage the time and had to back out of my commitment. I said to them, Unfortunately I recognize the faces but don't recall the names. I'm so sorry for that. They just laughed and were really glad to see me. As they were walking by they each hugged me. As I was hugging each of them I was congratulating them because they were there for their graduation. I remembered one name so as I hugged him I said, Congratulations Mike Mu. You're the one class member whose name I remember. But don't tell anyone else. He said, Oh. He was flattered that I had remembered his name. The oh was kind of like oh shoot. I can't tell anyone that you remembered my name? I didn't get to hug all of them. They went into their room. I went in also. They were trying to get ready for graduation. I had my hand in the air and waved at some of the others and softly saying congratulations. They were getting seated. There was a lot of equipment around. Maybe someone was videotaping or maybe it was a sound system. I happened to have my camera and tripod there. There were a couple of students that had their point and shoot cameras. I told them I would be happy to take some pictures for them. They said that would be great. While they were setting up I was getting my camera set up. I was going back and forth across the room. I got my camera out and then realized that I needed something from my bag on the other side of the room. This happened several times. It was challenging each time because there wasn't much room to walk between the back row of chairs and the back wall. Each time I was struggling to get by or asking people to scoot their chair up so I could get by. I went up along the left side of the room because Harry B was the instructor and was sitting in the front row. I went up to get his attention to say hello and let him know that I was there. He said hello and that he was happy to see me. He made a teasing, yet serious, remark about the fact that I had not kept my commitment. Somebody was questioning my ability to take pictures. I told them I was just a beginning photographer but that I had done a few photo shoots."
"0743"	"(2003-12-12)"	"Something to do with home decorating. We were adding a wall to a room. This may have been part of or for a TV program. There were candles in the room and we were going to store a lighter near each candle, like in a drawer. But I said it was very important that we tell people how to do this safely, that they shouldn't keep lighters on papers or on fabric because they could be an additional fire hazard that way. Additional, because if candles are properly used or tended they are a fire hazard. I said it is important that the lighters be stored on a hard surface that is not easily flammable."
"0744"	"(2003-12-12)"	"I was at an SAID conference. Macy F and I were rooming together as usual. The conference was much shorter than usual, maybe only two days. We were talking about this as we were packing and getting ready to leave. We had each only packed one very small suitcase because it was such a short conference. As we were packing we had the door open. Dalton G stopped by the room and said something. I said I was sorry that we hadn't had a chance to chat this time but next time hopefully we would. I continued packing, pulling things out of the closet onto the bed. I kept finding more and more things that belonged to me on the shelf of the closet. Large and unusual items that one would not normally pack for such a trip. The one item was a rather large, empty flowerpot that was stained from prior use. I was beginning to wonder how I had managed to get all of this stuff into this small suitcase. I had put some things inside other things. I also realized that, as usual, I was going home with more things than I had come with. I did have a nylon satchel of sorts that I could use to take extra things home. It didn't have a shoulder strap though. As I was emptying the closet I found a shoulder strap from a previous hotel guest and decided to take it and use it on my bag. There was still a lot of stuff left in the closet that didn't belong to Macy F or me. There was a row of books, CD's, or DVD's. I'm not sure which. Now I am in a car with BJ and Kim H. Kim H is talking about sorting through this row of books or whatever. She is criticizing BJ for not doing it each time she is there. So Kim H said that she did it. I was very irritated by this, partly because of her attitude and partly because of her frequent criticism of others. I told Kim H that I had sorted through that shelf before I left."

"0746"	"(2003-12-13)"	"I was working with a group of people on some kind of project. I think it was all women. I have no idea what the project actually was. The best way I can describe it is four large white banners that formed a square, leaving a large opening in the middle. Each section had rectangular pictures or graphics every so many inches. However, there were places that there was supposed to be a graphic and there was not. It was the job of the group to select a graphic for those empty spaces and put one in. We had a number of different options for selecting graphics. I suggested to the group that we choose one of those options and stay with it, as it would help us to be more effective. We could reach group consensus on each graphic more easily and we would be able to accomplish the task on time."
"0747"	"(2003-12-14)"	"I went Christmas shopping. The weather was pretty bad. It was snowing with low visibility. I thought it was a good day to go shopping because not too many people would be out. I was also getting my car worked on. I went to Glenview Mall. I was looking for a ramp that you drive down to get to a certain parking area or certain stores - I'm not sure which. It's not like this in waking life. While I was out I ran into somebody I knew. It seems that maybe it was Margaret L but it didn't look like her. It was a rather thin woman with black hair. I knew her in the dream and it seems that I knew her in waking life but I'm not sure. I talked to her outside, sitting in separate cars. I guess we pulled up next to each other from opposite directions so both driver sides of the cars were next to each other. I think I realized that there was more than one ramp to use for what I was looking for. It seemed that more than once that I was driving looking for that ramp. I also at one point saw Jody S and Jason S S, I know Jason S S for sure. He was one of the people I was shopping for. I asked him about his shirt size. He said 18 neck. He said 18 and a half sleeve too but he said I didn't have to worry about that because that's hard to find. I told him if he gets more than one flannel shirt or more than one (maybe colored Tees) that it wouldn't be a big deal because he can always use more than one. Then I said, Right? He smiled and said yes."
"0748"	"(2003-12-15)"	"It almost feels as though I am in some kind of house associated with a university. I'm packing. Occasionally I will I don't know. It seems that Darren is there. I'm debating about having a conversation with him, that it's time for him to either move out or at the very least move into a different bedroom. He could tell something was bothering me and he asked me. I finally said, I'm just debating whether I want to have an unpleasant conversation with you right now. As I continued to unpack my closet is pretty full so I asked him if he had thought about either moving all of his things into the spare room or something else. He was not at all happy about that suggestion. There was something about Christmas decorations. Darren had been lying on the floor on his back while I was unpacking. He said something about if he could help. I said, You know, you've just been lying there while I have done all of this. I think it would be fair at least if you could get up and help with this. He got up and started putting his clothes on hangers. I was taking them and putting them in the closet of one of the guest rooms. All of his shirts he was putting on a hanger but he wasn't buttoning the neck button. So I was having to straighten and button. He had a girlfriend and his daughter Annie H."
"0749"	"(2003-12-15)"	"I was giving a dream workshop that involved some type of artwork - drawing. The response was very positive. I had said something about the pen I was using. Afterwards the person who had hired me said she would like to go ahead and get the pens for everyone - I had apparently quoted her to include them but she opted out. I reminded her that she had opted out and as such not paid for them, so the additional fee would be around $1,000. They were about $1 each, personalized, and she needed 1,000. She didn't answer me but I had the sense that she needed to think about it or that she really didn't want to buy them, having been reminded of the price. One of the attendees came up to me afterwards and asked me how I learned to draw. She asked me if I see what I am drawing or if I just see lines. I pointed to an individual as an example and said, I look at her face. I simply look at the lines of her face, such as the lines of her nose, her hair, etc. She asked me if I could recommend some books that would help her get started. I was hesitant to tell her about the books that I used because I had bought them used at the Half Price Books store. I thought I might tell her that my books are very old and were given to me by someone. In my head I was justifying the lie by telling myself they were a gift - from me to me. I don't think I ever answered her however."

I'm at home now and preparing for him to come there. I had called the maintenance men and asked them to come and work on my chain lock. I needed to get it fixed before he got there. I stressed to them the importance of them getting it completed before Doctor C got there. They made a comment about why it was so important. I said something about him being a pulmonologist. They made a comment about doctors thinking they are so important. I said that he is a pulmonologist and a lot of time he does save people lives. If he gets paged the hospital expects him to show up immediately. He showed up. I greeted him at the door. The door reminded me of the back door of my birth home. I opened the door and greeted him. Before he walked in he leaned in and gave me a little kiss on the lips, but kind of like you would with family or a good friend. It wasn't at all romantic. We were both sincerely glad to see each other again. There was a woman intern with him. They wanted to change clothes. Doctor C didn't even ask where to go he just went ahead like he knew where he was going. I directed the intern to a second bedroom where she could change. They came out. We were sitting in the living room talking. This is my home but it's not familiar to me at all. Doctor C was saying that there was something different about me. I told him that I had lost 35 pounds. He said something about it being in addition to the 23 that I lost four years ago and I said no. I told him that unfortunately I had gained that back plus some. But I'm back now because of lifestyle changes so I can keep losing and keep it off this time. "

There was a lot of discussion about the overall look and was it the same general look as the other company materials or should it have it's own look or just have some tie in to the company such as the company logo. Someone had also created a graphic. It wasn't created by a professional. We all really liked it and were very impressed about how good it looked for not being done by a professional."
"0753"	"(2003-12-22)"	"I met my future husband last night. His name is Sal [unknown in waking life] . I had my laptop sitting on my bedside table and it was connected to the internet. I started chatting with him online, though I don't know who contacted who or how we found each other. Online he called himself Sal CEO. Our first interactions were fun and playful. Within a few hours he had arrived at my house to meet me. He is fairly tall, has reddish brown short hair, wears glasses and medium build. He is a very nice man, and fun to be with. I was sharing a home with Darren and with Maureen U from the sleep center. They were married and lived primarily on the first floor of this home. Sal and I wanted some time alone to get to know each other but he was very nice about the fact that Darren and Maureen U were there. They were each dealing with some kind of problem in their life, each separately, and he was being very kind in allowing me to do what I needed to do for them. We were both engaging in conversation with each of them about whatever it was they were each dealing with. He noticed a bumper pool table across the room and suggested we play. I told him I didn't know how and he would have to teach me. I went over to the table and realized that there was a piece missing or something and told him we couldn't play because of this. He suggested another game that the four of us could play. We were preparing to do that. I noticed how dirty the tile floor was. It was covered in black footprints. I said something to Darren and Maureen U about it, almost scolding them, telling them that they could be a bit more conscientious about taking care of my home since I had agreed to let them stay there temporarily. I lived primarily upstairs while they were staying here, but shared some rooms of this floor. That's why Sal and I were down there instead of going upstairs. While we were getting ready to play this game Sal and I found ourselves alone in a room for a few seconds and he gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he was going to do that before he did. It was nice. It was especially nice because it affirmed to me that he was enjoying being with me."

When we took a break to do this I didn't stand up to connect with someone right away so I had to sit and wait for someone to be free. As soon as I saw one woman sit down - finished - I asked her if she would take the photographs of me. We moved around to different places in the room. There was one place that had grey curtains. It was almost like a stage area. I was going to sit on the edge of the stage and have the grey curtains in the background. She didn't like the grey background. There was another place where the walls were kind of a cream/beige color. She thought that would be a better background. We went over to that area. As she was getting ready to start I realized that everyone else was done and sitting down. I said, This isn't good. Everyone is sitting there watching now."

She had another child that was a little bit older - maybe 5 or 6 years old, a girl. The room was pretty messy. There was a screen door. The door was open so I walked up to the screen door and I asked if I could step inside for a second. She said okay. I could tell she was a little hesitant because she didn't know me or why I was there. I stepped inside and said, My name is Anna. I used to live here. You don't know me obviously. I wondered if I could just walk through the house. She said it wasn't a very good time that they really hadn't even closed on the house yet. I said that was fine, that I understood. I put my hand on my chest and was fighting back tears. I said that it was okay and that maybe I could come back another time. I left. As I got to the front sidewalk another woman came out. She was the owner of the house - that was selling the house. We talked a little bit. I introduced myself and told her the same thing - that I used to live there and that I really just wanted to walk through the house. Her husband came out. We were all looking down the street and talking. They said that they had had trouble selling it and ended up selling it for less than they had hoped. I said I had the same problem. I was divorced. Actually, what I said is that we were going through a divorce so I just had to sell it. I told them the neighbors had gotten upset with me because I sold it as low as I did, but that I really didn't have much choice because I had to sell it and move. We had a nice talk. They both gave me their business cards and in fact the woman gave me two of them. She had two different business cards. They told me to give them a call in a few days and they would see if they could arrange for me to come over and walk through the house. There was a third person there but I don't know who she was or what her connection was to all of this. Now I'm standing at this outdoor sink. There's an attachment on the sink, kind of like the ones you would pull out to spray and rinse out the sink. I was doing something with that. It wasn't exactly like that though. It was a hose and the end of it looked more like a garden hose. I had put something in the end of it and was thinking about that. It was almost like it had something to do with a penis."
"0757"	"(2003-12-24)"	"I had to wear a floor-length black dress. It was kind of a sheer fabric with gold lame' design. I was at a party as either the host or playing some kind of major role there. There was someone that was very envious of the fact that I was wearing this dress. I don't know who it was that was envious. I have a feeling that it was Jennifer F. That would make sense to me that it was her. As I said you could see through the dress. On the gold lame was a t shape. The first one went across the chest. The next one was below that a little smaller. The next one below a little smaller. Then there were three more, the same size as the first three, below that. I was wearing something like a full-length black bra under it. Bev and I were talking about undergarments. I had said something to her about this one and how it made me feel more comfortable in a lot of different clothes and how it gave me a smoother line. Someone else chimed in and a little bit later when Bev and I were alone I told her I had one on under this dress so she could see what I was talking about. She could get a better understanding of what I was talking about."
"0758"	"(2003-12-26)"	"I had a pet piglet. I was looking all over the house for her. I finally found her in a plastic jug, shaped like the ones you see on a water cooler, but it was a pinkish tone, but still clear, and much smaller. While I was rushing around in a panic trying to figure out what to do for her and how to get her out I kept wondering how she managed to get in their. She was lying on her side and took up almost the entire space inside the bottle. I thought I would find some kind of heavy-duty scissors and try to cut the bottle away. Then I found someone to help and they suggested we rush her to a vet, which we did. It was still too late. They said by the time I found her she had probably already died."
"0759"	"(2003-12-26)"	"I went to some kind of an office or meeting space. I don't know why. But when I got there I realized that there was an all day conference going on and at each meeting time of the day there was only one session being held. I thought that was nice because you didn't have to choose between speakers. Jennifer K was one of the speakers. I had already missed the first couple of sessions because I didn't know this was going on. I wasn't registered so I think I went to find someone to see if I could still register. The building had a very long, very narrow hallway - barely room for more than one person in the hallway at a time. The ceiling was also very low - not much more than 6 feet. The walls and doors were all white and they had signs with very small lettering on each door to say what was going on each room."
"0760"	"(2003-12-26)"	"I was on a trip with a bunch of people. Some of them were characters from the TV show Will and Grace - Will, Grace, Karen, and Leo. Will received a phone call that Jack had died. He collapsed to the floor when he got the news. Grace ran up to him to see what was wrong. We thought Karen would probably take it very hard as well. we were in a building with no heat and it was the middle of winter. There was a lot of snow outside. It was almost as though we were in a cabin in the mountains somewhere. A number of people were either ill or becoming ill. Leo went outside and was hiking up this mountain to get this special box that would allow him to heal everyone. Someone else went out also and found it before Leo and brought it inside without telling him. Leo came back and saw what had happened and was very angry with this other guy, telling him that it would be useless to anyone but himself. I was trying to divide up the blankets fairly so everyone would have about the same amount to keep them warm. I gave Karen a sheet and a lighter blanket to make up for others having a heavier blanket."

"0763"	"(2004-01-11)"	"I and some family members were standing outside a home. I was standing outside a car. I think Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car. Someone was shooting at me. I think there may have been other family members in the car as well. I think later in the same dream we were in the house. Maybe it was a Harris reunion. A lot of people were spending the night. I'm not sure where we were. I think we were at my house. Alan K and Jean K were going to share my bed. Jean K was going to sleep in the middle. At one point I woke up in the dream and - that was when I woke up from this dream where someone had been shooting at me. When I woke up Jean K was awake. I said something to her. She was telling me that she had just had a dream in which either someone was shooting at me or she was shooting at me. I said, Oh. You've got to be kidding. I just had a dream that you were in that someone was shooting at me and that Aunt P and Aunt H were in the car I think. There was also something about Linda W and Dick W but I don't know what. We were going back to sleep but now Alan K was sleeping in the middle instead of Jean K. I was trying to get comfortable. They had moved so that I was right on the edge of the bed. I moved as much as I could but finally told them that I was about to fall off the edge of the bed. Jean K said to Alan K, Alan K. She's about to fall off the edge of the bed. But they didn't move. I tried to push against them to get them to move but they still wouldn't. I think Jean K got up now. I pushed against Alan K again and said, You have got to move over! I think he finally did move over. Then Larry K came in. He was alone. He was talking to us a little bit. He took his shirt off and was going to get in bed with us. I said, Oh no. I am not sleeping between the two of you. I'll get squished. Larry still got in bed on the other side of me. I said, I guess I'll sleep on top of the two of you because I'm not sleeping between you. So I was lying kind of on top of the two of them. They were both lying on their left sides. I think I was mostly lying on Larry K's back. I was noticing how much hair they both had on their backs. I usually think that is kind of gross but for some reason theirs didn't bother me that much. Maybe because it was lighter or not that thick. It was kind of curly. There was something about when Jean K told me she had that dream about it being the third time."

"0765"	"(2004-01-13)"	"Matthew and I were living in the condo. He seemed to be his current age yet he also seemed to be living at home rather than away at college. I was sleeping upstairs in the loft. I was frightened but I'm not sure why. Then I heard this loud noise downstairs. I got up the courage to go the railing. I leaned over the railing a bit and tried to call out for Darren. I thought to myself that this was typical of a dream - that I wanted to call out when frightened but couldn't. After a couple of tries I was finally able to say, Darren, is that you? He answered and said that it was. I went downstairs and said something to him about scaring me like that, especially when I was already scared. Now I was sleeping downstairs on a sofa. I got up to use the bathroom. There was a half bath on the first floor under the loft. I opened the door and saw how close the toilet was to the door. The toilet and the sink were sitting side-by-side and the front edge of the toilet was just inches from the bathroom door. I said I had forgotten how tight the space was in the bathroom and decided to go upstairs and use that bathroom. I went through the master bedroom to go into that bathroom. While I was using it Matthew came in the other door and got something and left again. He noticed I was in there but didn't seem to notice that I was using the toilet. He came in again and this time I had something to him like, ahem, Matthew? Some privacy here? He just kind of half-grinned, apologized, and left. After I was done using the toilet I went out into the master bedroom again. It was full of Darren's stuff. It seems that he stayed there occasionally and I was allowing him to have that bedroom as his for the times when he stayed there. Maybe it was to somewhat compensate for my ending our marriage. I was looking at the mess though. His bed was unmade. He had boxes and piles of clothes and stuff everywhere. You could hardly walk in there. I noticed that he still had the dresser from the bedroom set we bought when we got married. But then I realized that he had several low and tall dressers in there. I was thinking that I was going to switch with him and take the master bedroom back. I was wondering if I could get Matthew to help with that move sometime soon. It seemed ridiculous for him to have the master bedroom when he is only there now and then and for me to be sleeping on a sofa downstairs when I live there. I wasn't sure how Darren was going to take it."
"0766"	"(2004-01-14)"	"Matthew and I were driving back to the city where I live from St. Joe. As we neared I-465, nearer to the city, you could see the skyline. In the skyline there were two very distinct buildings. One was directly in front of us. The other was off a little bit to the left. They both had very large words on top of the buildings. I could read them from there. We were talking about the buildings, what they were, which one was tallest building in the city. I decided that the one to the left was in my way, was blocking my vision while driving so I reached up and bent it over, almost a U shape, to the ground. That didn't break anything. Now Matthew is a very young child and it's the fourth of July. We're on our way to see the fireworks. My intention was to find someplace close to home, on the way home, to just stop and watch the fireworks and then go the rest of the way home. Matthew was pouting because he wanted to go over to the west side of town, to some place where I knew it would be packed with people to watch fireworks. I had to call Darren for some reason. I was trying to be very nice. I wasn't sure how he was going to be with me on the phone after my latest emails when he got kind of miffed at me. I was still being very nice. He asked me how I was and I said fine. I told him Matthew was pouting. Darren said something. I guess I didn't realize that he wanted to talk to Matthew. Then he said, No. I'm not kidding. Put him on the phone. I gave Matthew the phone. Apparently Darren said something to him about pouting. At this point we were laughing. We weren't in the car anymore and there were a lot of people around. I was trying to explain to Matthew that it was going to be so crowded and uncomfortable and it would take us so long to get out of there after the fireworks. I let Matthew talk to Darren. Darren seemed to make it a little better but not much."
"0767"	"(2004-01-14)"	"I was on a trip related to SDI. I was rooming with a woman much younger than I. One morning she woke me up sitting on the floor next to my side of the bed. She was making unwelcome sexual advances. I wanted to be kind in how I handled it but yet wanted her to be very clear that this was unwelcome. I was lying on my back and she her head was resting on top of me, and one arm kind of draped across me, from my left side. I was going to try to move a bit to my left and place my right hand on her hair, hoping to indicate more gentleness as I spoke to her but found myself unable to move - as happens sometimes in dreams. Because I was not responding to her she climbed up onto the bed and lay on top of me, but she was on her side, in a fetal position, and kind of perpendicular to me. I then was able to move my arms and I cradled her while I told her that I was not interested in this type of relationship with her and that it made me very uncomfortable. I later called the BE Retreat Center to speak with Sister Rachel about withdrawing from the program and this was one of the reasons why. I am at the BE Retreat Center and trying to get in to talk with Sister Rachel about this. When I do get in to see her and begin to explain why I am there she said, You want to talk to me about this? She then said something about the fact that while she is getting settled in her new position members of the SDI are to speak with a Sister Roseanne about such matters. For some reason I thought she was going to tell me that I needed to talk to Sister Betty. I didn't know who Sister Roseanne was but felt strongly enough that I needed to speak with someone that I decided to go ahead and speak with her about it. It seems that I did go in and speak with her but I can't recall any of that now."
"0768"	"(2004-01-14)"	"Something about the CAS training manual. Now we are in a facility that had several women's restrooms. They each had several stalls. All of them were out of toilet paper. All of the other women seem to somehow be making do without. But I was unwilling to do that. I knew where they stored the toilet paper so I went and got a roll. At the time I didn't know that all of the stalls were out. I had went into one that was out previously. When I came back and went into another it was out also. I went to the storage room and got another roll and took it back with me. As I was using the toilet I heard a woman in another stall say something about being out of toilet paper and another woman told her she just had to make due. I said, No you don't. I can tell you where they store it."
"0769"	"(2004-01-16)"	"We were remodeling and/or redecorating living spaces for a number of different people. I say we but I don't know who the people were that were working with me on this. The living spaces we were working on must have been fairly unusual. I don't remember what the houses looked like only the spaces we were working with. We had designed cubes that were completely open on one side. They were just slightly smaller than the size of the room we were working on. These cubes could be lifted with a fork-lift and slid into the room. Rather than accessing through a door the owner would access through the open wall of this cube. It appears that there is no other part of the structure/home around the frame that we slide the cube into. All of the cubes we were doing seemed to be home office spaces. We had designed them all at one time. We designed several different looks based on certain needs. Then we identified which look was best for each person. At one point the content of the cubes was more like text on a page rather than a room layout. We decided that one person would need several cubes because it was simply way too much text for one page and that multiple cubes was not a good option - maybe not an option at all. I came up with the idea of putting the text onto computer files so the person would have easy access. I said this would actually work much better for them than simply laying it out in the cube anyway. This then freed up the cube for one of the room designs we had done and were using for the other people."

"0772"	"(2004-01-25)"	"An actor was in town at a local establishment, maybe a restaurant. He was engaging primarily with me and the people who were traveling with him. I don't know why me. When I first saw him I thought, Oh, I've always liked this man. He always seems like such a nice man. I don't know who it was though. I have the name Benjamin Bratt in my head but I know it wasn't him and I haven't paid much attention to him in waking life. Anyway, he was going to be doing a kind of impromptu singing performance and he wanted to sing primarily to me. He pulled a wedding or engagement ring out of his pocket for a prop. He asked me if I liked it. I said I did. The ring had one large diamond in the middle and was surrounded by two rows of smaller, yet not small, diamonds. The ring was not a full circle - it was adjustable. I put it on the ring finger of my left hand. I took it off a time or two and put it back on. He was sitting across from me, maybe at a table. I put my left hand on top of my right hand, somewhat outstretched in front of me. My hands were tan. I checked my nails to see what kind of shape my manicure was in. They looked fine. I think I did this more than once as well. It seems that after that he was maybe sitting on a stool, or some chair that made him higher than me. He was still sitting in front of me but he picked up my hands and laid them on his right leg. I don't remember seeing the ring on my hand. Some of the other people there were envious that I was getting all of his attention. There was nothing romantic about it but there was something about me that he found endearing and comfortable maybe. I was enjoying myself but I don't think I was really feeling flattered, or honored, to be the center of his attention."
"0773"	"(2004-01-26)"	"I was helping BJ and her organization prepare for a garage sale of sorts. We were having the sale in one of the buildings they own. In part of the building they had very tall warehouse-type shelving. We had taken all of the things that they had received and recycled - fixed up for reuse - and put them on these shelves. I told them to be sure and remove the things that they want to use in their new office. Someone was worried about some type of criminal activity so a man there said he would have a gun placed somewhere near the shelving and bullets in a separate location but also nearby. At first I didn't think that was necessary but later agreed that it was a good idea. There was something going on that we were either debating about how to do or what to do for quite a long time or something that we couldn't resolve."
"0774"	"(2004-01-27)"	"I was working with a team of people on some kind of project - home improvement or decorating. One of the last things I wanted for the homeowner was a storage bench seat- a rectangular shaped box with a hinged lid so they could use it for storage and sit on it. I wanted it to place it by the door so they could sit there to take their shoes off when then come in. I wanted it to have a back on it of about 6 inches and on the sides I wanted the back to taper down to about the middle of the lid/seat. Then I wanted an upholstered cushion for it. I drew four different design options for the carpenter because we were running out of time to complete the job and I wanted him to make the nicest one he could with the allotted time. I named each one after a person because each one was like one that person owned. One was named after me so I named it Anna F. One was named after Anna Fi so I named it Anna F also. At first I wrote Anna S but quickly realized that S was her maiden name so I changed it to Anna Fi. I realized that wouldn't work so I changed mine to Anna Father and hers to Anna Fi. I don't remember the names on the other two. But then later I changed the name on each one from the name of a person to something else."
"0775"	"(2004-01-28)"	"I and some other family members were at BJ's house, though it looked different than it does in waking life. I was in the house with some of the others and was looking out the window. BJ was in her car. It was a very old, large, red car. She was going somewhere. I noticed parts falling off from under the body of the car. I was thinking how dangerous the car is and said this to someone. I went outside and she had gotten out of the car and came back to the house. I said something to her about needing to replace the car and she agreed. Bill F was standing there. Now it seems that the car belonged to Bill F. We started talking about him donating the car. We went back into the house. Now the car was a flowering plant. It was in a very large, round planter. I was thinking that it was odd that as much as I like flowers and plants I didn't especially care for this one. I was studying it and began to think that I could really learn to appreciate and enjoy it. As I was doing this Bill F had a hand spade and was digging up the plant. It seemed to be several separate plants in the one planter. He was digging them up and separating out the individual plants. Someone asked the name of it. They said it was some kind of orchid. It didn't look like an orchid does in waking life. I can't remember the name now but at the time I thought it was such a beautiful name and it gave me a new appreciation of it. It's as though it changed how I felt about something else - feeling more joy. It was covered with small pink flowers with white and yellow on the inner part of each flower. Each flower had about four petals."
"0776"	"(2004-01-28)"	"I was working for a company that was involved in some kind of public event. After the event was over we were tearing down and cleaning up. I was paying attention to how someone had run the electrical wiring, or maybe it was related to telephones or computers. I was telling someone that I really liked the way they had set that up - that it worked really well, it was inconspicuous, it was out of the way. As we were cleaning up somebody was selling some things. I paid more than $1,000 for this telephone because I knew that someone had just won more than 20 million dollars in the lottery but they needed this telephone to be able to claim their winnings. I thought that since their prize was more than 20 million dollars they would be willing to pay a lot to get this phone that they need to claim the money. After I bought it I knew I would be hearing from them soon about buying phone. I was having trouble trying to decide what a fair price would be. It certainly wasn't my intention to take advantage of them, knowing that they had to have this phone to collect their prize. My intention was simply to make a good investment and get a good return on my investment. I thought it was fair for me to charge them more than $1,000 for the phone."

"0778"	"(3004-01-29)"	"I was in my mother's hometown. It was in the evening, dark outside, and cold. I was walking but I don't know why I was there or where I was walking. Somewhere along my walk I put down my coat, my scarf and my gloves. Later I realized that I had picked up by scarf and gloves but had forgotten my coat. I don't know how that is possible since it was cold outside. I was now in some kind of a store. There were two young women, late teens or early twenties, working in the store. They were putting cards of earrings on a circular earring rack. I had the impression that one of the two women had made at least some of the earrings. I pointed to them and told her those will sell very well, and I was basing that on either having sold a lot of them myself or knowing about a store that sold a lot of them. I had actually ended up in the store by accident and wanted to go through the store to get someplace else. The store was pretty crowded and messy. Now I was carrying something like a plastic laundry basket, oval and very pliable, and it had something in it. I was kind of pushing it together as I saw aisle after aisle crowded with stuff and thinking if I squeezed the basket together I could get through the aisle but kept avoiding trying. One of the women finally came over to me and pointed out an aisle that was clear. I went down that aisle and out the store. When I had first entered the store the women seemed to not be very nice - as though they didn't want to talk to me. They didn't seem to appreciate what I said about the earrings. After I left I thought of something else and went back and just stuck my head in the door and told them what I was thinking. It was something that I thought was either good advice or another affirmation of something they were doing. This time they seemed much nicer and seemed to appreciate what I had to say - like they were really going to use my advice. After I left the store I came to WHHHS, which is not in town in waking life. Again, I went into the building to go through and try to get to where I was going. I got lost in the school and found someone and asked them how to get to an outer door. When I got to that door there was an older woman there giving another woman directions. After she finished I asked her for directions for where I was going outside the building. She gave me directions and they seemed simple and easy to follow. After walking for a little while I either got lost again or was no longer sure that the directions were correct or that I had heard them correctly. I decided that I would walk to Aunt P and Aunt H's house and ask them to drive me to help me find my coat and my car. I don't know why I wouldn't just ask them to help me find my car and then I could drive around and try to find my coat myself. I came to a place where I couldn't go further as I thought I would be able to. I saw Mother and asked her how to get to Aunt P and Aunt H's house from there. She told me to just down a couple of blocks to Dair, go right on Dair and I would know where I was. I don't know why I didn't ask her to take me, why she was there, why she was outside, or anything like that. As I started walking towards Dair I looked at my watch and saw that it was 8:40 p.m. I knew I had to hurry because I didn't want to be knocking at their door after 9 p.m., especially if I wanted them to drive me somewhere at that hour. I began to run the few blocks to Dair Ave. When I turned right on Dair I found myself going through buildings again. It seemed that I was going through a private office, or maybe the office of a little hotel. The only other thing I remember is thinking that it might have been better to just call Jean K and ask her to come and get me and take me to find my car - and maybe my coat."
"0779"	"(2004-02-03)"	"I was working at the CAS office. I had just come in for the day. I is typical for me in waking life I asked Bill C what his schedule was for the day and let him know that I thought we needed some work time and some time to talk to him about me and CAS. As the day progressed he seemed to be very busy. Like going from one place to the next - went on an appointment, came back, left for another appointment, etc. I had gone in Bill Cro's office a couple of times and there was stuff everywhere, all over the table, underneath the table. The rest of the time taking things in there. Setting them in there. I can't remember what some of them were. I went out. When I came back I saw the office door, there was something like mosquito netting hanging off the door. I went over and looked in and Bill C was in there meeting with the other two men and hadn't waited for me. I was so upset. I walked over and saw that Blair K had as well. Then I really become even more upset. Bill Cro and Blair K got up and walked out. Evidently Bill C was not including them so they felt it was wasting their time. Bill C looked up and realized what he was doing. He got up and came out of the office. Bill Cro and Blair K had issues about me not being there. I was now sitting at the front desk and Bill C was talking to three people standing there. They wanted to schedule their next meeting and Bill C said I could take care of that. I was thinking that here he was treating me like a secretary again. I went back into my office and was trying to clean some things up, return some calls, etc. I wondered how Bill C could not recognize how well I'm doing and see how easy it is to ____. There was something all over the floor that I was trying to clean up. I don't know what it was. There was a woman there and it was her last day at work so there was a party. I was trying to get something into her office and out of the way. It seems that there was an open window between her office and the rest of the office. Her and I had a very brief discussion. She asked me if I could find a file that I had asked her to try to find earlier. I ran into a compute problem, something with the printer. I was trying to cancel printing but it wouldn't stop. I was holding it in the air. Dottie E [unknown in waking life] came in and got the regular printer to stop but the thing in my hand was still going. I asked her about getting it to stop and she just walked out without answering me. I went back out into the office. Bill C was there again and getting ready to leave. I said something to him about meeting with him. He said, well, we have about 45 minutes before I have to leave. I asked him if he was coming back and he said he hoped not but he probably would. He didn't say anything but I could tell by the look on his face that he realized I still wanted to talk to him. I think he was trying to avoid it. I think I finally said something and he said we could do something right now and that he thought we could get done. I was thinking that we didn't have that much time, he's in a rush, he doesn't want to have the conversation, do I really want to have it now in these circumstances or do I want to let it go again and let it keep eating at me?"
"0780"	"(2004-02-03)"	"I was at the CAS office sitting across from Bill Cro's desk. Bill C was leaning against the table. We were talking. I think I was trying to narrow down a time when he and I could meet. He was saying that he wasn't going to be available because of family things. While we were talking, three or four times, he was adjusting the buttons and zipper on his trousers. He was reaching just inside the very top of the zipper. It was as though the zipper wasn't closing completely and he was trying to fix it. I found it very distracting and quite odd behavior for him as well. When he said he wouldn't be able to meet because of family time, I said that was very commendable because a lot of people don't have that dedication to family. I said it is also nice for his family that he is so dedicated to them. He looked at me kind of odd, as though I had some kind of hidden meaning to what I said or something - perhaps being sarcastic or critical. I didn't. Subconsciously I may have been feeling that I wished I had someone in my life so dedicated to me."
"0781"	"(2004-02-06)"	"I was with some of my family, Bev and BJ for sure. There were others but I don't know who. We were in a gift store that sold religious and spiritual items. We were standing there talking and Bev made the comment that she had just recently made her first P E Circle. I thought to myself, P E Circle? What is that? At first I hesitated to say anything because I feel that they expect me to know a lot about spiritual life. I finally decided to go ahead and ask in such a way that maybe they would think I was just interested in knowing more about her experience or that I just didn't understand what she said. Bev looked at me and kind of laughed and in a critical tone of voice said, you don't know what a PE Circle is? It had something to do with something vocal and yet there were four things and maybe there were two options of groups of four things. I say things because I have no idea what these things were. Somehow these things impacted the vocal quality of whatever this was. I had chosen between these two groups of four. I had chosen the four that gave the lesser quality. This sounds extremely weird but it almost seems as though they were chairs. I had decided to paint the backs of these chairs black. But they looked like, I can't even visualize the whole chair just something that looks like the back of a straight back chair or the kind of chair that we have in our training room at work except that they had a pattern with little holes all over it. There was something about spraying them black."
"0782"	"(2004-02-06)"	"I was driving through a parking lot that had huge piles of sand all over the place. People were coming and paying for and taking some of the sand. I don't know how they were taking it. The piles of sand made it very difficult to drive through the parking lot. Some of the areas seemed more like I was driving down a street where there had been snow and ice. Parts of it were melted and parts of it were very thick so where I was driving was very uneven and rough. The owner or whoever was responsible for maintenance needed to come in and reorganize the piles of sand and dirt so it was in neat piles and would clear out more of the driving space. I think Matthew is in the car with me. There was a woman there. I don't think she was in my car. Maybe in her own car. She didn't know how to get where she was going and she asked for directions. I said it depended on whether she took 465 north or south. She said, south I guess. So I told her which way to go. She asked again. I gave her the directions again. She told me where she wanted to go. I didn't know where that place was so I couldn't help her. Someone told Matthew to watch for a yellow, circle-shaped, inflatable something. We were driving around and saw several things that looked like they could be what we were looking for but somehow we knew that they weren't. We saw someone coming out of the hospital. "

It feels like I am in a hurry to get home so I decided to fly over these buildings because it would be faster than walking all the way around them. I was trying to get home. It was dark. I was talking to someone about life insurance and some dream thought about a waking life dream conversation. I was thinking in the dream that this wasn't the same at all."
"0787"	"(2004-02-11)"	"Now I was in a gardening store and I was looking at flowers, flower bulbs, potting soil, fertilizer and such. Now it seems that it's a drug store that is selling these things. They had what we used to call dump tables in the retail stores where I used to work. They were shaped like a box so you didn't have to worry about things falling off or getting knocked off. They had flowers in these tables. I touched one of them to see if they were real but they were silk. I decided to come home."

"0790"	"(2004-02-14)"	"Someplace with Ben D. The building began to collapse and people were shouting to everyone to get out. Only one section of it collapsed. We checked to make sure no one was trapped or injured and they weren't. Ben D and I were outside, he was standing behind me, facing me with his arms around me. He asked me if I wanted a behinder. I've never heard that term before but I assumed I knew what he meant. I said that I was sure he would enjoy that. Then the building started to collapse again and everyone began to run. Ben D was still behind me with his arms around me. He barely lifted me off the ground and began to run. My feet didn't even touch the ground. Someone told us not to even turn around to look, to just keep running. We kept coming to places of water and I kept saying with panic that I can't swim. It was as though we skimmed across the water. This happened several times. Finally, we heard the building come crashing down behind us. After we were sure we were safe we stopped. We were just at the edge of the demolished building. Where we were standing was by a type of corridor to the building. It had not crashed completely to the ground. I saw people in there who had not made it out. I started reaching in and helping people to get out. After everyone that I could reach was out I saw that there were more people in there so I went in far enough to reach the others. They had been injured, but all of them were in a seated position with their legs straight out in front of them but they were bent way over towards their knees, a sort of yoga position. But they couldn't move, even though they had room to move. I reached for each of them and slid them out by the boards they were sitting on. I didn't even think about the fact that this part of the building could collapse the rest of the way. It was an old house that had been three floors."

At first we were all going to be sleeping in the same room, what used to be the boys room. We had one large bed and someone had pulled chairs up alongside the bed so one more person could sleep across the chairs. The people who had been in what used to be the girls room were leaving so I was going to go sleep in there. BJ came in and was going to sleep in there as well."

"0793"	"(2004-02-21)"	"I was getting married. I don't know who the groom was. I don't know where we were getting married. I was running out of time but there was still a lot to be done. I was supposed to set up chairs or rearrange seats in the church. I had not had a shower yet. I was going to take my shower and get ready and then go set up the chairs. It was 4:45 and the wedding was supposed to start at 6 pm. I was getting panicky. Someone was using my shower. Someone else told me that I could go to a friend's apartment and take a shower there. I went there and started getting undressed when I realized that all of the walls were windows. Even though they were opaque people could still see in. I was trying to find furniture that I could duck behind so people couldn't see me getting undressed. The apartment was very close to the street so there were people walking by. I was taking some newspaper. I think I was only naked from the waist down. I was trying to cover my breasts so people couldn't see them. I think BJ was with me. She was pushing buttons on the wall that were supposed to lower some window shades. There was a woman standing outside and saw us putting the shades down. She signaled to BJ not to do that. I think BJ must have signaled back to her. When she got the idea what we were doing and why she was okay with it. We got the windows covered. BJ told me to go ahead and start taking my shower. She was going to go get my toiletries. The shower was circular, on a platform and very, very large. It looked like a circular stage. The shower head was in the ceiling. There was a shower curtain that pulled around it. I hadn't turned the water on yet. The person who lived in the apartment was standing there now. She said something to me so I stepped out a little bit from around the shower curtain. BJ showed up with my toiletries and stuff. Jody S, Kim H, and Matthew were all there now too. I was trying to get started taking my shower and Kim H wanted to take some pictures of BJ. She got in my way so that was postponing me again from taking my shower."

"0795"	"(2004-02-23)"	"I was at the CAS office. It didn't look the same as it does in waking life. I was near the kitchenette area. There were two jars sitting there. They were clear glass with no labels and with lids. I tried to loosen the lids on each one and couldn't though I didn't try very hard. Bill C walked up just as I began to try so I just asked him to open them. He opened them very easily. I said that I don't usually have difficulty opening jars. Then I wondered why I said that and why it was important and why I didn't try very hard. One jar had lemon drops in it and another jar had hickory nut halves. I took one lemon drop and one hickory nut half and put them both in my mouth at the same time. Bill C walked away while one of us was saying something to the other. In a very short time I put two more lemon drops in my mouth. I was thinking something about him seeing me eat these lemon drops and what he might be thinking about that when I had been doing so good on my weight loss plan last year. It made me uncomfortable for him to see me eating these lemon drops."

My fiance came in wondering where he was supposed to get dressed. I pointed him towards the boys restroom. I don't know if he said something or if he just looked at me odd. There was some kind of communication or understanding that it was odd or not the ideal place to be dressing for our wedding. Maybe a bit uncomfortable. But it was, in fact, the area that we needed to get dressed."

"0798"	"(2004-02-28)"	"I was with family but I don't know who's house we were at. Jim D called and then showed up. I was so thrilled to hear from him again and to see him. It was nothing physical. He was there visiting with me around the family. We had shared a couple of meals together. At one time he and someone else was hungry so I went to McDonald's for them. When I came back I was putting their food on plates. I noticed that the french fries were not done well. They were very soggy, not crispy. This is odd because I thought before that they said they wanted me to go the little Chinese place around the corner from my house. Jim D left and called me at work and left a message on my voice mail. Part of his message said that our voice greeting was too confusing or long or complicated. I went to tell Bill F and he got a little defensive and didn't like it. I said that Jim D had been in the voice mail business for many years and I just thought I would pass it along."
"0799"	"(2004-02-29)"	"I saw John Cusack, the actor. There were maybe three other men. I was working for Gary S. There was some thought or discussion about our past relationship. I was thinking that I knew better than to do that again, especially now that we are working together. Him, these three men and myself were trying to get more information about something wrong or bad that was going on in some bar or restaurant. I think we set up kind of a sting so we could go in and catch the culprits. Gary S was going to be the target. The rest of us were just going to be in the bar watching. When the bad men made their move we could move in on them. I don't know what we were actually going to do. I think it was a bar but it was very well lit. It seemed to be in the middle of the day. We all went in at separate times so no one would know we were together. When I went in I walked around looking for a seat next to one of the men I was with for safety, but I couldn't find one. I walked out and came back in and finally spotted one. I went up and acted like I didn't know him and asked if I could sit in the seat next to him. There was another man on the other side of the empty seat and there was very little room. I had to squeeze myself in between them to sit down. My arms were against each of them. I don't know that anything that we expected to happen actually happened. I think the place emptied out but I don't know why. Now I think there is another woman with us. We were all standing and something started to happen that felt somewhat like an earthquake but not really. We knew that wasn't what was happening. We all huddled together and were holding onto each other tightly so we wouldn't get separated. I was standing and I was looking at the floor. It started changing colors and the colors were swirling. I realized that time was changing. As soon as it quit, I guess I must have closed my eyes, I opened my eyes and saw that we were now in a diner - kind of a 50's diner. We were all dressed alike, in white uniforms, with a kind of red string tie around the collars of our shirts. I said that we were working in a diner now. Apparently the diner was just getting ready to open because there were no customers in there. I think the woman was with me but I think there were also people in there that weren't part of our group. One of the women who was working sat down at one of the booths and started looking at the menu. Each table had a menu laying on it. Customers started to come in. I walked over to the door at one point and pushed it open - the door opened out. I welcomed them and told them to have a seat, that someone would be right with them. It seems like it was dark outside now. The surroundings seem to have changed again but I don't know how or to exactly what. I was looking around and decided to look outside. When I went to look outside the door closed behind me and I couldn't get back in. I realized that the time had changed again. I got a bit frantic to be separated from my group. I was running around the building trying to find a way in or a way to at least communicate with my group. I found this one little slot. It was a rectangle that was maybe 12 by 18 inches. It had a kind of door on it that opened up. When I opened it there was another, and another, and so on. I don't think I ever got to the last one. They were made of different styles and materials. One was almost like leather with a leather pull strap. I thought I would be able to open it and call inside to my group to let me in or to help me. I ran a little further and found the door that we had gone in originally. I was relieved but when I tried to go in I found the door was locked so I still couldn't get in. I turned around and there was a man standing in front of a car looking at me. I could tell I was in trouble. He had an evil grin on his face. He stood there for a minute and then he started walking toward me."
"0800"	"(2004-02-29)"	"I'm at home in my bedroom. I realized that my bedroom windows were open. When I got up to close them I realized that they were open because someone had broken in. My first thought that it had happened earlier and it didn't even occur to me that someone might still be in the house. I thought they had come and gone before I got home. I closed the window on the right side of my bed, noticing that the blinds were damaged. I went to the other window and tried to close it but it wouldn't stay closed. It kept rising back up. I kept pushing it down thinking I could get it to stay closed. Then I noticed how damaged the blinds were. They were very damaged and I couldn't do anything with them. People would be able to see in. I wasn't dressed because I don't wear anything to bed. I was ducking behind the curtain while I was trying to do something with the window. I pulled the curtains across the window, together, but realized I couldn't get them to stay there either. They looked different than they do in waking life. I was pulling one all the way across the window thinking that maybe I could get it to say behind the bed. That didn't work. Then it started to rain, freezing rain. Then I decided to go get something to sit on top of the window pane, so if I pushed the window pane all the way down and sat something heavy on it, it would stay down. I thought of something that I could use and it was in Matthew's room. As I headed into Matthew's room I realized that the TV was on, that something must have messed with the power to cause the TV to come on by itself. Then I realized that the other TV's in the house were on. I was trying to find a light that I could turn on. I thought there was a table lamp on a high dresser. There was all kinds of stuff sitting in front of it. I was being very careful but I ended up turning on some kind of large toy instead of a lamp. Then I was reaching much lower to the other side of me and I accidentally turned on another toy. I went to his closet and found my Ti Ping (don't remember the name) balls that are used for relaxation. They were in their box so I took those thinking they would be heavy enough. I pulled the window down in my room again, sat them on the top, and the window went right back up because they weren't heavy enough. Then I thought about my weights. So I went and got all four of my weights. At first I sat the smaller ones toward the center. I realized that the right and left sides of the window were sloped so I wouldn't be able to get the larger weights to sit there. So I put the heavier weights on the center. That still wouldn't work. The window was still open and the freezing rain was still coming in. I messed with the blinds again and tried to twist the wand to close them. I thought maybe if I could do that I could get them to straighten out. The wand was turning very hard. I was having a very difficult time trying to turn it. Then I started messing with the curtains again trying to get them to close and stay closed. I thought maybe I could put a chair in front of the window against the curtains to hold them in place. I was trying to decide, I thought about calling emergency maintenance and telling them that my window was open. I hated to bother them in the middle of the night. But I thought with the freezing rain it should be okay to call them but I still didn't want to bother them so I didn't call. Then for some reason I decided to go downstairs. As I went downstairs I heard some noise. It was kind of a hissing sound. As I was walking around I noticed that a window was partially open. I realized that it must have been from whoever had broken in. I closed it and was looking around again. I don't know what I was doing again. Then I noticed that the patio door was open. I thought that was strange because I was almost sure that it hadn't been open a minute before. I closed it and then I heard a window open. Now I really got frightened. I headed towards the front door though I don't know why or what I was going to do. Then I saw someone in the kitchen. I grabbed a very thin rope. I started yelling, Go away. Go away. Then Tim U came out of the kitchen. I didn't know what to think at first because it was Tim U, who used to be a maintenance man in my community. Before I could say anything or ask him what he was doing there he held up something that looked kind of jumper cables. I could tell that he was the one who had broken in and that he was there to rape me. He was saying in a very high-pitched sarcastic voice, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. He intended to tie me up with these jumper cables and then rape me. Somehow I realized that he had done this to other women and that when things went wrong he either hurt them very badly - physically, or maybe even killed them. I was looking at him very intently. I was thinking that as soon as this is over and he is gone I'm going to report it and I'll be able to tell them exactly who did it. I was thinking about what I could have done differently. If I would keep my car keys on the front table maybe I could have grabbed them and gotten out the front door and gotten away. Where would I go? I thought I could have gone to a gas station but he might have followed me and could grab me outside the station. I wouldn't want to go in the station and put the employee(s) there in danger. I wouldn't want to drive all the way to my parents house, though I don't think he would have followed me that far. I realized that I don't know where a police station is in the city where I live. That alone scared me. Then I thought I could go to a fire station. But where is the closest fire station? I know where some of them are but I don't know which one is closest. But I could pull up to a fire station and blow my horn. There would be fire fighters there 24/7 so they would hear my horn and come out to help me. Now I started thinking about what I needed to do. I decided that I need to go to the office and found out where Tim Uis now because I know he doesn't work here anymore. I knew that I had seen him enough that I could give the police a good description and I could tell them definitely who it was."

The images of the dream though were those of creating a document in MS Publisher where you can flow text from one page to the next within text boxes.

I was trying again to successfully program my car so then we could use that as a guide to help other people program their cars successfully."

I am playing around and I find that as I swing I am able to make the whole frame of the swing jump forward or backward. I can make it jump forward a couple of steps. The swings are very close to where the football team is practicing. I don't know if I am still on the swing or something related to the football team teasing. One time when I do it I realize that I've maybe gone to far or gotten too close. I turn around and start to run away. They decide to run after me and tackle me. A bunch of them do and they land on top of me. There is something about being in one of the buildings and something flying around in the building. A bug or a bird maybe but it's too big to be a bug and I'm pretty sure that it's not a bird. There's also something about me working on a computer document. There is a whole list of categories or maybe a list of titles or groups of words. I'm going in and looking at changing groups of words and I'm going in and changing the description of that title or group of words."

There aren't a lot of images and so not much to record. No characters. Don't really see a setting. I see the settings on the printer and I see the copies coming out wrong."
"0804"	"(2004-03-04)"	"There was a sense with the imagery that I was at a computer working on an Excel sheet. There was a list of things that at one point I realized that there were one or two things that I needed to always have at the beginning of the list because they somehow impacted the outcome of. I think maybe it was a task list. I needed to have these one or two things always at the top of the list in order to get the other things done. These one or two things were, one or the other of them were always on the list. This list was only for one person and yet there is a sense that is for me and not for me."
"0805"	"(2004-03-04)"	"I went into a store that sold fabric and carpet. I don't know if they sold anything else. I was looking specifically for some blue denim. I have no idea why. The displays, or where they had the fabrics stocked, were all very tall, taller than 6 feet. They were cube shaped with each side of the cube was open where the fabric would slide into it. Where the carpet was displayed, each side of the cube just had little squares of the carpet samples. They seemed to be on the kind of rack that stores use to display posters, where it's kind of like turning pages in a hanging book. When I was walking around this store I saw Dick W. He was a decorator. I think, when I saw him, I was____. Now I'm not sure. I noticed him and was thinking something about the fact that he was in there shopping. He was talking to an employee about the project he was working on, getting ideas, or explaining what he was looking for, not sure. There was also something about DDSI. There was a very tall metal cart. Taller than me. Yet it's other dimensions were that of a typical metal cart on wheels, rectangular shaped. It was outside on pavement on a slope. I pushed it down the slope. I can't remember if I rode down the slope on the cart of if I just pushed it down the slope and just let it go on it's own. I have more a sense that it was the latter."

"0807"	"(2004-03-07)"	"I can't decide if what I was doing was for school or for pleasure. I was in an historic home. I was there with other people that I knew. Supposedly the house was haunted by a former female owner of the house. During the visit we all went into one room for a kind of class. We had to go which makes me think it was for school. There was something about women had died in this room before when some certain thing occurs. I was sitting in the room listening to the lecture. The woman giving the lecture was dressed in period clothing but I can't tell you what period it was. She was talking to us as though she was this woman who continues to haunt the home. I was sitting there thinking that every time I am in that room I get a really sore throat. I thought it was related to this ghost but I don't know why. As the lecture continued she was talking about her ability to create bubbles or something out of this tube of liquid. We all had clear glass tubes with blue liquid in them. The tube was actually six-sided. I was holding mine between my legs but I don't know why. I think it had something to do with my not wanting to influence it with my hands. As the lecturer was talking I was watching the liquid in my tube and I realized that I was the one that was. It was like she was trying to blow a bubble out of this liquid. That the liquid would rise to the edge of the tube and then form a bubble on the top outside of the tube. While she was trying to do whatever it was I was watching the liquid in my tube rise and still hoping that I wasn't the one she had chosen because that meant that I was the one that was going to die if this legend continued of women dying in this home at the hands of this ghost. As the liquid rose it started seeping out of the tube onto something on my leg that was round but it had grooves in it almost like flower petals or a starfish, kind of like spokes coming out from the center of the circle. The blue liquid would ooze out and was filling these indentations in this round circular thing. Then it didn't ooze out from there. Somehow the liquid stayed contained in the grooves of this circle even though there were no edges on it to prevent the liquid from seeping out. The woman who was presenting the lecture and posing as the ghost approached me. We were talking about this circle thing on my leg. She was touching it and was trying to assure me that I was not going to be the next one to die as a result of this. After the lecture was over we were in another part of the house and we were still discussing it. Again I noticed a sore throat. There were other people that we were talking to in the house."
"0808"	"(2004-03-08)"	"I had a computer document that Bev and BJ both wanted a copy of. When I told them it was created in Publisher Bev said that she no longer had Publisher software on her computer and she made some kind of comment about what a pain that is and that it had something to do with hospital budget I think. BJ said she had Publisher. I asked her what version it was and it was a very old version like 1990. I don't even think there was a 1990 version of Publisher, or even of Windows. But that's what she said. I said, Oh. Well then you won't be able to open it because an old version of Publisher can't open a document that was created in a newer version unless both versions are 2002 or newer. Then John S was going to do some work on my computer. I had a new hard drive to install and something else but I don't what it was. It was something that I have never installed before. So he was working on my computer and he was working on some other stuff too. He got ready to quit and he hadn't installed this one thing that was most important yet. He said something about not getting it done so I started asking him if it was something I could install myself or asking him how to install it myself. Then I think Bev said something to him so he decided to go ahead and take the time to install it himself. I felt kind of bad about it but it turned out that it only took a few minutes to do."
"0809"	"(2004-03-10)"	"This was something about SDI. There was a number of us involved in a discussion, sitting in a circle as we do in small group. My parents were there and I had been sharing something and Mother looked at Sister Rachel and asked if it would be okay if she asked a question of me. Sister Rachel and I answered simultaneously however I said no and she said yes. As soon as I heard her say yes I became very upset because she had promised me before they joined us that they would not be allowed to ask questions or give input. I was feeling very upset by that. There was another part of the dream where we were working on some kind of activity or exercise. We had these books, three of them seemed to be art related books. The other three I don't know what they were. I don't know what we were doing with them. It looked like we were now in a kind of cafeteria or classroom. The tables were the typical six foot rectangular tables with two chairs at each one. We were working at those tables. My classmate Rachel I was there."

I just know that we were working on these things that were made out of wood that were probably 5 or 6 feet square. Two perpendicular edges were trimmed with something that looks like crown molding. We were cutting the wood, cutting the molding and attaching it and then painting them. On the back of each one we were writing three things. I think they were paint color, style of crown molding and I can't remember what the other was. We thought we had them all done when we learned that we still needed a couple more. In another scene we were working on something else. There were six of those. They were much smaller but square. They did not have trim on them. They seem to be something decorative to be hung on walls. We had three of the six completed. It was very late in the day and we were all exhausted. We were asking someone, I think it was the designer, if she could make do with three because we were all just totally worn out and did not feel that we could even do one more."
"0811"	"(2004-03-13)"	"I was walking up to the inside of the front door of my home. I was walking very slow because I was kind of afraid to look out the peep hole for fear that whoever was out there might be able to see me inside. When I looked out I saw it was Darren. His face looked really big like when you see something in a convex mirror. I said, Darren? Is that you? He shook his head yes. I reached up and put the chain on the door before I opened it just in case it wasn't him. When I opened it I could tell it really was him. He had his wallet out and took out a $50 bill and handed it to me. I took it and told him to wait a minute. I closed the door so I could take the chain off and open the door all the way. He backed up and I stayed up and thanked him and asked him something else. I also told him that I had written the Dept of Revenue about the title to that car, explaining the situation to them. I got a response from them just telling me that there was no lean on the car that I just needed to send them the title and they would send me a corrected title back. I asked him to please mail the title to me. I also told him that I sent him an email and guessed that he had just not had a chance to read it yet. That's when I explained to him about the letters. He said he would also send me something else but I don't know what that was. While I was out there talking to him Matthew came to the top of the stairs and called me. He was very little, maybe only three years. He said, Mommy. Mommy. I said, Just a minute Matthew. As I tried to wrap up my conversation with Darren I was thinking that I needed to go in and see what was going on with Matthew. I was thinking that I needed to tell Darren that. When I did go in I remembered that Brian F had been here and had changed our steps. We had wanted steps going into the basement, which I don't have in waking life. So to do that he had to take the steps upstairs and replace them with steps downstairs. He replaced the stairs going up with a pull-down ladder that you use for attics. I realized that was why Matthew hadn't come down, because he didn't know how to come down now. I pulled the ladder down and was really scared about using it. It was a very long way down to the basement and it was pitch black dark. Even in the best conditions I would have been afraid of going up that ladder. There were no rails to hold on to. I got to the top and I realized that I had to step over to the floor where Matthew was. The ladder was kind of swinging now so it became extra dangerous and scary. I did manage to get over there. Then I started wondering how I would get Matthew down stairs. I couldn't carry him down that ladder and he certainly can't climb down himself. He was lying in bed right next to the opening. I had put something around his ankles and tied them to the bed so he wouldn't fall through the opening. He got up and stood by the front of the opening when he was calling me. Now he was asleep again. I lay down on my stomach and rested my head on his stomach. That woke him up. I was really panicking about how I was going to get Matthew downstairs. I am back on the first floor thinking how these steps are not going to work, that I'm not going to be able to get Matthew down. I need to call Brian F and see if he can come back and see if he can just make the steps narrower and just have steps going up and down so I could go up like I use to. When I went up the ladder there was very little room between the ladder and the roof. It looks more like an attic than the second floor."
"0812"	"(2004-03-13)"	"I was in the apartment getting ready to do a load of laundry. But I was doing it in the toilet in the downstairs bathroom. I had a very large load of permanent press clothing. I thought I could do it all in one load. I realized there was no way I was going to get it all in there at once so I started pulling some pieces back out. When I thought I had enough things out I flushed the toilet and it started pulling one piece of clothing down and then it started overflowing. I was quickly pulling clothes out one piece at a time and dropping them onto the floor where the water was overflowing to soak up the water and keep it from spreading out further. In just seconds the water was like 3 or more inches deep but it wasn't leaving the bathroom into the kitchen. I think I finally did get enough of the clothes pulled out to either soak up the water or to block it so it wouldn't go out into the kitchen."
"0813"	"(2004-03-13)"	"I went outside the apartment. It was night and had started to snow shortly before. The ground was already covered. I was thinking about going somewhere so I had gone out to clean off the car and see how bad it was to decide if I really wanted to drive in that weather. As I got close to my car, it was parked to the left of the sidewalk, one of my neighbors across the street and to the right yelled out to me. I didn't understand her so I started walking towards her saying sorry I didn't understand you. She said it again but I still don't know what she said. As I got close to her I asked her if she was going out in this weather. She said she was going, to a family member or something to see the____. I'm going to say eclipse but it wasn't eclipse because it was night. I looked up into the sky and said I don't know enough about astronomy to know where to look. She said something like you can't see it from everywhere that's why she was going to this other person's house. It was something like you would be able to look into the sky and be able to see something like I'm trying to figure out how to describe it. I can picture it in my mind because when I was looking in the sky for it I knew what I was looking for. I knew what it would look like. It would look like a partial eclipse with a partial arc of light in the night sky. It wouldn't be moving like an eclipse either because it would be in one place for most of the night."
"0814"	"(2004-03-13)"	"I was married and living along a river. My husband had gone horseback riding in the river. I think there was bad weather coming so myself and some others went after him to tell him that he needed to come home. When we went to get him we were walking through the river as well. I was wearing a thong bikini, which of course I would never do in waking life, especially not at my current weight. The people that were with me had brought horses along. Oh. He wasn't on horseback. When we found him the people that were with me gave he and I both a horse to ride home. They didn't have saddles so we had to ride bareback. Mine was a beige color horse. I climbed on and was having a bit of trouble getting situated because it was very uncomfortable since there wasn't a saddle and I was wearing a thong. The horses did all have a bridle and harness so we could hold on to the reins. We started down the river and I was surprised at how comfortable I was riding this horse and that I wasn't having any trouble at all. The horse seemed to naturally follow the other horses. We started riding them through the river to the house."
"0815"	"(2004-03-14)"	"I was living in an apartment building with a long hallway that had apartments along each side of the hallway. It almost looked like the hallway of a hotel. I had learned that one of my neighbors had a cleaning woman that was a, maybe even two of them, good and charged $83 per cleaning. Actually I think I talked to the neighbor first to see if she would tell me about her and tell me how much she charges. I was telling one of my other neighbors because I thought that was fairly reasonable. But then I think I said I knew someone else who charged less than that. Somehow though I was talking to a cleaning person, or thinking about talking to a cleaning person, to find out if there was a way that I could have her clean and it would be less money per cleaning or if I could afford to have her come just once a month."
"0816"	"(2004-03-15)"	"I had met some women. I don't remember. I think we talked about CAS. I had intended to contact a couple of our female clients who with a couple of other professional women who were prospects for our training. I had intended to contact one of them named Colleen [unknown in waking life] , at a future time. They both worked for the same company. I was back at the office and there were various things going on in our training room. It looked more like a conference room. It had two large oval tables that sat perpendicular to each other but one end of each was next to the other. These women showed up, all five of them, and wanted to talk with me - actually Colleen just started talking immediately about why she was there. I asked her if she could hold on for just a second. I wanted to go see if we could go in the training room and sit down and talk. I headed in there because I knew Bill C was in there working. I wanted to see if he would mind going into another room so I could take these women in there to talk. As I went in to ask him the women all just followed me instead of waiting for me as I had asked. They just went in and sat down. I could tell Bill C was kind of upset. There was also a sofa sitting along one of the walls of this room. I went ahead and sat down and started talking with them. I don't remember, but I may have asked Bill C if he wanted to join us. I went ahead and sat down and started talking with them. Bill C sat on the sofa in a fetal position. He was wearing a hairpiece, that was fairly long - not below the ears, messy, black. There was something going on with him. I suspected that he had been drinking. I looked at him and said, Bill C, you really don't need to be here. If you have someplace else you need to be that's fine. He mumbled something, got up and left. I was relieved that he did. My meeting went very well. We ended the meeting with the agreement that I would do a proposal and take it to Colleen. I am back at the office and Bill C is back but he is now with several other people. It appears that he is either sober now or trying to sober up and one of the people in particular that he is with at the office is the person he calls whenever he starts drinking again. I went in the room with him once and someone was either saying something directly to me about not being there or I felt like I shouldn't be there or maybe someone was just suggesting that I not be there. I went in and started talking to Bill C and that actually made it feel that it was a good thing that I was there. I think maybe I left that room and Jane C was there."
"0817"	"(2004-03-19)"	"It was 9 am and I was on my way someplace from home. I'm not sure where I was headed. I'm thinking maybe to the CAS office because it seems that Bruce U, from maintenance there, is with me. In fact, I let him drive. I was stopping by the apartment office so he just pulled up perpendicular to the guest parking spaces by the office rather than pulling into a parking space. He pulled across the end of two of them. He got out and I got into the driver's seat and pulled into a parking space. He jumps up. I apologized and said I was afraid I would be in the office too long and didn't want to be sitting out there in the street like that and blocking two parking spaces and such. He walked off but I don't know why or where he went. As I was walking into the office there was another black man walking alongside me. I don't know who he was or why he was there. I had a sense that he worked for the apartment community. Maybe he was one of the maintenance men there. I struck up a casual conversation with him, asking him how things were going and such. I went to the door of the apartment office and I realized that they weren't open yet but I was just going to wait. For some reason I wasn't realizing just how long I would have to wait. Pretty soon someone comes to the door and said since they were already there they would let me come inside and wait. I went inside. The office looked much different than in waking life. there was a long hallway directly in front of you. There were offices to either side. I was walking down this hallway trying to figure out where I should wait because there were nothing but offices with a couple of chairs by each desk. I get all the way to the back and there is someone back there - it's the woman that let me in. She looked at me quizzically. I told her I was trying to figure out where I should sit to wait. I don't remember her reply but she did ask me why I was there. I think I told her that I was there to pay the rent - whatever it was for I had a check to give to someone who was expecting it. She found something for me so she was giving that to me, telling me what it was. She decided to go ahead and take the check I had and take care of that for me. Because it was only going to take a few seconds. It turned out to take longer but she still went ahead and did it. She was making casual conversation, being very nice. She said something about this kind of thing occurring - like people asking them to let them in early or take care of things early. I told her that I try to be very careful about doing that because I know it can be an imposition. I know people take advantage when you are nice enough to do it once. I don't know that I actually said it to her but it was more like I was reminding myself that she did this for me and that I did not want to take advantage by asking her to do this for me in the future or expect her to do it for me in the future. There was also something about Bev and BJ but I don't know what it was."
"0818"	"(2004-03-24)"	"Some of the family was at Brian F's. We had finished making his draperies. BJ and I were sitting at the kitchen table with Jason S. He started saying that he was there on Brian F's behalf about paying us. In waking life there was no agreement with Brian F to pay us. He didn't pay us. Jason S was going to try to renegotiate with us so Brian F wouldn't be paying us as much. BJ started to object and I stood up and, Jason S and I were sitting at opposite ends of the table and BJ was to my right, I leaned across the table. I leaned one hand on the table and with my right hand I was pointing a finger at Jason S. I didn't raise my voice but I was extremely stern in saying things like, Now just wait a minute here. Our agreement with Brian F, Jason S starts shaking his head no, and I said, Wait! You listen to me. He kept shaking his head. I said, Jason S. You look at me and you listen to me. His face got really serious. I said, I told Brian F before we ever started this that those draperies would cost him $1500 a window if he were to buy them custom-made retail from WDF. I told him then that the only way I was going to help him make these is if he paid us $7.50 an hour. I was thinking in my head that he did not realize how many hours it would take even though I tried to warn him - and I did underestimate how many hours it would take. Brian F came out at that point and asked what was going on. At some point I could see that BJ was really upset and starting to cry because she was really counting on that money. To me it wasn't as much about the money as it was about Brian F keeping his word. I told Brian F what was going on. At this point Jason S had tears in his eyes too. I felt bad now and Brian F said that he had no intention of renegotiating. We had an agreement and that's what I intend to pay you. Now I am outside. BJ is outside. Jody S is there. I hugged Jody S, as it was the first time I saw her that day. As I was hugging her I told her that I upset Jason S. I didn't tell her that I made him cry. Somebody said something to Jody S about Jason S wanting to renegotiate our agreement with Brian F."
"0819"	"(2004-03-29)"	"I was on my way someplace to give a presentation or workshop. I was driving a semi. I had gotten off at the exit ramp and stopped. There was a man standing in the exit ramping, actually pacing back and forth across the ramp. I got out of my truck and approached him. I don't think I actually talked to him. I think he was speaking with someone else. I went to figure out what was going on. As I did I realized that he was also driving a semi and his truck had broken down and was blocking the ramp so I couldn't go anywhere. I went and got back in my truck. Just as I did I saw him starting to pull his truck out of the way. There was enough of an opening that I could get by. I started to go through. As I did I realized that he was starting to roll backwards. I really burned it, giving it all the gas I could before he rolled into me. I was concerned and had it floored trying to get out of there but I wasn't panicked. I did make it. Now I am walking through a field and realize that there was another turn or something after I got off the ramp, that I missed to get to where I was going. I was walking through this field and there were a lot of people in this field working. One of the people in charge was a woman. I approached her and told her that I must have missed a turn. I told her where I wanted to go. She pointed and told me how to get there. I turned around and started walking back out of this field. There were a lot of people working there. They were all men except this one woman who was in charge with another man. As I'm walking out of the field, they are spraying things. I'm trying not to say anything or complain because it's my own fault that I'm there. But whatever it is that they're spraying it's hitting me a little bit and I'm trying not to be concerned about it. But I don't think it was just water so I was concerned. I also don't think it was a dangerous chemical. I was just concerned about it messing up my clothes or my hair, or how I was going to look when I got there to make the presentation. I walked into the place that was waiting for me. I tell them a little bit about what happened and that all of my stuff is in the truck and I had planned on getting cleaned up and getting ready when I got there. One of the things that was It was a couple of women that I was talking to. I don't know why but the topic of hair color came up and I had this little bitty thing, it was about the size of an ear plug, that was hair color. I also had one ear plug. One of the women suggested that this other woman could go ahead and help me color my hair since I had that with me. So she took me back to this other room and I had on my black shell top. She asked me if I needed to change and I said no, that I thought I would fine. I thought the way the top was cut it wouldn't be a problem. But I questioned to myself whether or not I really wanted to take that chance - of ruining my top."
"0820"	"(2004-03-30)"	"I was working at PUI. After work, around 4 or 5 pm, I left to go to a computer class on campus. I had not trouble finding the class. It was a short walk. There were a lot of people. It was a very large room. When I got ready to leave I grabbed my backpack and briefcase and left. I went out into another area of the building. It was a big common area divided into sub areas by furnishings and such. There were seating areas, refreshment areas and such. I was on my way to my car and reached for my purse to pull out my car keys. I realized that I didn't have my purse with me. I left it sitting in the computer classroom. Now I was confused and wasn't sure how to get back to the classroom. I stopped someone and asked but they weren't able to help me. At first I saw various people going into one area and sitting down to use computers and telephones. It was different ages and genders. I decided I would go ask one of the women. As I got close to them I realized that they were working for a company, making business calls. They were all working for the same company, doing the same thing. I changed my mind about asking one of them for help. I turned and walked away. I was near an elevator and now it was wall-to-wall people all of a sudden. I felt like I was getting run over. It seems that it was all men. I thought I let out a little scream, not very loud, but loud enough that someone could hear me. One man stopped and looked at me. There was another man, he and I just exchanged glances, but seemed like several seconds. Maybe we recognized each other. I finally asked another man if he could please tell me how to get out. I told him what had happened and that I needed to get back to the computer classroom to get my purse. He and another man I think. The one man decided to just go ahead and walk me there. He started practically running up these steps. I told him to wait a minute, that I couldn't go that fast and could not take the steps that fast. I started taking steps two at a time. Then I just quit taking the steps and kind of floated up the steps and caught up with him. When we got to the top of the steps he was extremely winded and muttering under his breath about taking the steps so fast and something else. Then all of a sudden he is gone. Now I am in an area that looks like the lobby of a movie theater. I went up to the counter to ask someone working behind the counter how to get to the classroom. There were a young man and a young woman working. The girl was going to call someone to get help for me. As we were standing there it was as though the building started shifting, it was like the walls and floor were motorized. The place where we were standing all started moving, fairly rapidly. I grabbed on to the counter because I didn't know what was going on. It seemed that the room did this in between movies, like when they were getting ready to let people in for a new movie. Now I was even more lost. I think it happened twice - but the second time I was at a different counter. Somewhere along here I realized that I had stuck my purse inside my briefcase so I did actually have my keys, because I saw my cell phone in there. Now I was just as lost, if not more. I still needed help finding my way to my car."
"0821"	"(2004-03-30)"	"I was living in the condo, except that it looked different than in waking life. There is something about a haircut and having two different people to choose from. I see a computer drop down list with each name mentioned. Both of these are people that I've had cut my hair before in a dream - I don't know them in waking life. I had narrowed it down to these two people that I allowed to cut my hair, depending on which one was available."
"0822"	"(2004-03-30)"	"Darren needed to tell someone, a woman, that I am still alive. He's really struggling with it. I think we're at the condo. He's struggling because he thinks he's going to have a really hard time with it. Maybe it's mother. It suddenly seems that it is mother that he has to tell. I sit down on the sofa with him. He is wearing the purple robe I made for him. He's been crying cause his eyes and nose are all red. I asked him why this is so difficult for him. I asked him if he is concerned about trying to explain why I let her and others believe that I was dead? I said, If it is, just tell them that at the time that I thought it was in Matthew's best interest."
"0823"	"(2004-03-30)"	"I was at PLU at the kid's apartment. I had some regular paint that they wanted to borrow. One room of their apartment they had painted the ceiling a bright yellow but they had also put stripes of other colors on it. There were going to do something else. I came back later and saw that they hadn't done it. I was in a car with Matthew. It almost seems that it was a police car. There was tons of traffic and he was cutting through the traffic. There were some people directing traffic, like at intersections. They signaled him on through because they thought he was coming through to help direct the traffic. Actually, I think I was dropping him off someplace. We had both gotten out of the car, and I tried to close my car door and didn't get it closed all the way. He came around and was going to close it for me. I couldn't get it closed tight and I couldn't get it back open. So he came over and got it closed all the way. As I left I decided I was hungry. I pulled into a McDonald's but when I pulled in, I pulled in right between the tables. It was like they were outdoor tables. I realized that it wasn't the place to pull in to get to the parking lot but I couldn't turn around, I couldn't go forward. I had to keep the switch the car back and forth between forward and reverse trying to maneuver myself straight so I could back out easily. I had pulled in because I was going to get breakfast. I saw these partially hidden hamburgers lying on two different tables. One was in front of me to my right and the other was behind me to the left. Neither of them were on buns or had anything else on them. They were each just a plain hamburger patty lying there, partially eaten. I think one of them belonged to Matthew so I was just going to grab it and finish eating it. When I finally got out of there I started driving down the street and thinking about doing a little clothing shopping because there seemed to be sidewalk sales everywhere. I thought maybe I could buy some clothes that were either a little tight or a size smaller than I've been wearing to help motivate me to keep working towards losing more weight."
"0824"	"(2004-03-30)"	"It looks like I'm at my birth home but it was___ Alan K was a doctor and he had left a message for me saying that he wanted to talk to me about something, I don't think it was medical at all. He wanted my help with something. I had gone there to pick up Matthew. He was a baby. I think 2 years old or less. He had a rash all over the front of his legs and arms. I was debating whether or not to go see if Doctor Pf could fit him in or to call, or just talk to Alan K since he was a doctor and right there. I called his office instead to see if he could take a look at it. As I called him he answered the phone. Since it was me he told me that he wanted to schedule that appointment to talk about the other thing. Then he asked me why I was calling. I told him it was because of Matthew's rash and I was hoping he could look at it. He kind of passed it off like it was no big deal. I just said that I was concerned that it was measles or something because it was so bad. He finally came out and looked at it. By the time he looked at it there was almost nothing there. I said that was really odd because it was much worse than that just a couple of minutes ago. I wondered if it was an allergic reaction to something I was wearing, because when I was holding him and he was close to me it got really bad. Before that there was also something going on with me and I was thinking that if I called Doctor Pf he could just see the both of us. Whatever it was that was going on with me I didn't want to talk to Alan K about."
"0825"	"(2004-03-30)"	"I had ordered a new whirlpool bath. After I ordered it I was concerned that it would actually fit in my bathroom. What to do with the bathtub versus the shower stall. There was something like that going on."
"0826"	"(2004-03-31)"	"I was on my way to the CAS office to work. I needed to go to Kinko's on my way in to pick up some printing they had done for us. I was driving across 116th St. As I went through one of the intersections I saw the light turn red above me. Of course, I kept going because I was directly under the light when it turned red. As I got closer to R1 Rd., there were road crews working here and there. I think they were filling potholes. There would be two or three men at each of these different places and traffic was going pretty fast with this construction workers right there. They did not have it marked well so you would even notice them very far ahead. They weren't using orange cones or anything. Some of them were working along the side of the road to my right. Some of them were actually right in the middle of the two lanes. That was very dangerous and I was concerned for their safety, that some of them might get hurt. When I got close to where I would turn in to Kinko's there were construction workers right in the middle of the four lanes of traffic. There was also a big pile of sand right by the entrance to the parking lot. When I went to turn left into the parking lot I am now on foot. There was a lot of traffic so I ran to get across the two lanes. I think it also had been raining. I had on my white girl shoes so I was walking very gingerly so I wouldn't get my feet so wet and because I was walking through this sand. I noticed by this big pile of sand that there were also various shapes and sizes of rocks or stone. Maybe they used them to help fill potholes. I was stepping on them to avoid some of the water puddles. I was walking across the parking lot and I heard someone say something. I turned around to see if they were speaking to me and who it was. It was a woman with long blonde hair. I said, pardon me she repeated herself but I still didn't know what she said, I think I didn't understand her, but I might not have been able to hear her well. I just smiled and nodded yes, pretending that I had heard her. I kept walking. I got across the parking lot to the sidewalk where Kinko's should be but they weren't. That woman was still there so I asked her what happened to Kinko's. The space where they used to be was now a clothing store. She said something like, Well, do you just want to start here? I said, I'm sorry. I needed to go to Kinko's. What happened to them? They used to be right here. She said, Oh. No. She walked around the end of the building. At this point it almost looked as though there was a roof connecting the whole U-shaped shopping center."
"0827"	"(2004-04-12)"	"I was working in an unusual kind of Coffee Shop. The owner was a woman. The employees were both male and female. I was the newest person on the staff. We all wore costumes as part of the shop atmosphere. They were New Age or Gypsy-look. While we were working the owner said she needed to go check the Bubble Gum Bar. The Bubble Gum Bar was an area outside the building where she had a row of bubble gum machines. People could write a question they wanted advice on and insert it in the bubble gum machine. They would immediately get a piece of bubble gum and then after the owner had answered their question she would somehow get the answer back to them - she didn't do it right then and there so I'm not sure how they got their answers. The machines were set up like drive through bank machines. Inside the coffee shop the questions would come into the building in those same kind of tubes. I wanted her to let me begin answering the questions, or at least to do some of them. She was unsure about my ability to do so. One of the male employees was there and I was getting aggravated at him because he knew that I had already answered 12 of them prior to this and had my responses had been received very well by the coffee shop patrons. He wouldn't say anything to the owner, and I wouldn't either because I knew he was the one who should tell her - for whatever reason. I felt that I would be betraying him if I were to tell her myself. I kept looking at him trying to get him to speak up. Finally he did. She was surprised and then he showed her something that let her know how I did. I told her that because I work as a counselor and spiritual director outside the coffee shop I am well-qualified to work the bubble gum bar. She decided to let me try a few more. I think some of us are lying on mats on the floor talking. This man is kind of rolling around - being childlike and playful maybe? He rolls very close to me and our lips brush. I know he wants to kiss me but is hesitant to so he does this instead. I don't pursue it. Later I went to the Bubble Gum Bar counter inside to pick up the newest questions to answer them. Now there is a female employee who is upset because I get to answer the questions. I explain to her that I work as a counselor and spiritual director and because of that experience I am a good person to do it. The owner tries to make her feel better about this as well. After the owner walks away her and I continue to talk. She tries to convince me that I can trust her. I decide to at least let her read the questions. As we are reading through them I see her handing them to someone else to read. I become very upset that she betrayed my trust. I grab all of the questions and leave. People who drive up to the Bubble Gum Bar can see me at a window and can talk to me there. Justin Bateman drives up in a mini-van. He has several friends with him and two small boys, twins, who are his sons. They are about 4 or 5 years old. Justin is considering submitting a question but leery about doing so. I now tell him what I do for a living besides my work at the coffee bar. I want him to feel more comfortable submitting a question and feeling that he will get a meaningful, helpful response. For some reason all of the adults get out of the minivan and leave the twins in there. The van starts to roll away. I am now in the van but in the backseat and the boys are in the front seat. Justin is talking to them on a cell phone trying to tell one of them to put his foot on the brake, which one of them manages to do. In the meantime I crawled into the front seat, grabbed the steering wheel and got the van out of traffic, got my own foot on the brake, and then put the van into park. Justin shows up and is very grateful - feeling that I have saved his sons lives. I was very humble about it but glad to have been able to help. He now feels much better about submitting his question and having me answer it. There is also now some romantic interest - initiated by him. I'm thinking about it, primarily about the fact that he is so much younger than me but thinking that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. In waking life I have never dated anyone more than a year younger than myself. I had to get back inside the coffee bar. It was late at night and I was the only employee working. A large group of people came in for coffee. They were all together so they were laughing and having a great time. I was going from table to table to get their orders. All of our coffee drinks were unusual and had unusual names. The first table I went to had two women sitting together. They were having trouble deciding. A woman from another table called out to me what she wanted. I started to laughingly tell her that I would have to get what they wanted in order or I would never be able to keep it straight. While I was saying that, some members of the group told her to be nice to me and wait her turn. I was being very playful and goofy, making them laugh, and they were all having a great time. I went to get the orders from several of the members of their group that were on exercise mats on the floor. One of the men, my age or older, was doing yoga stretches. I began to mimic his moves. As I did a back bend I motioned to another that I needed help getting up. I didn't really but I did it playfully. It made them all laugh. The man who was stretching and the other man were saying something. I looked down kind of seductively and said, I can build it. And the man who wasn't stretching said, and he will come. I looked up and said, shame on you, knowing that he intended a sexual connotation. I had the same thought when I said it, but hoped they wouldn't know that, or maybe hoped it would occur to them but that they wouldn't be sure of my intention. I think I said it because I was interested in the man who was doing the stretches. It did seem to pique his interest in me."

"0830"	"(2004-04-23)"	"Myself and some of my family members were at a middle school, attending an event for Bob F's three older boys. They were all wearing navy blue slacks with red and gold shirts. I was thinking how grown up they all looked. Stephen F had said something to Bev about something he heard but he only told her part of it because he couldn't remember all of it. I was talking to Bev about it. Because he couldn't remember all of it, it seemed to cause her some concern about Rachel S. I remember saying to her Oh Bev, it's not like she's going to be the next Hitler."
"0831"	"(2004-04-25)"	"I went to Tara S's graduation party. I stopped on my way home from St. Joe. Matthew didn't go with me. It was very awkward. They were having the party in their backyard. Some people were arriving and going to the backyard through the house. I just walked around the side of the house to the backyard. As I got around to the backyard I just stood there for a few minutes just observing. I'm not sure why. Some people were singing happy birthday and laughing because it wasn't a birthday party. Tony S and Dorothy S finally noticed me and came over and said hello and gave me a hug. They acted as though it had not been that long since we had seen each other. Dorothy S sat down and started talking with me. She didn't look pregnant but I got the impression that she was pregnant again. Later she had the baby and the baby was about a year old. Later I am back at the party and other members of my family are there. I had walked up and I think I was going to sit with them. It was now about 10:30 p.m. and I said I needed to go because I'm not used to staying up that late. I heard someone playing music and I asked if that was Tina S and they said yes. Someone said that Tara S had played one instrument and Toni S had played very simple instruments and Tina S had played something that took a lot more to learn. It might have been a clarinet. She was very good. I didn't actually see any of the three girls. They said they were so proud of Tina S's paintings, her artwork. They said something about the one in the entry way was one of hers. I had seen it earlier and I went back in to look at it again. They had it framed. It was fairly large. It reminded me of a page out of a coloring book that had been colored but I'm sure she did it freehand, not colored in someone else's drawing. When I got ready to leave Dorothy S suggested we get together for lunch. I said sure and told her to give me a call. As I was leaving it was now winter and there was snow on the ground. I had a shovel. I think I was going to clear a path. I noticed that there was a car behind me. I moved out of the way and the car just sat there. I waved at him to go on and he seemed to mouth the words, Aren't you going to clear it? I laughed and said no. I could tell by the look on his face that he was very irritated. He backed up and then went forward. Dorothy S came out and I told her what happened and that I couldn't believe he thought I was going to clear the whole road or driveway for him. Then she told me to call some government department and she told me what I should tell them. It was something very odd that I had not heard before. I went ahead and cleared whatever it was that I had intended to clear. It only took me a couple of minutes. I don't like to use the phone and I really don't like to use a cell phone while I'm driving. So I didn't have any intention of making the phone call that Dorothy S had suggested. Whatever it was she said would get this road on their list for the future - so they would clear it better or faster."
"0832"	"(2004-04-26)"	"Grandma F was in the dream a lot. While in the dream I was very excited that she was in the dream so much. We were on Grandma F's farm but I was an adult. We were doing chores but there was also something about baking cookies or some kind of cooking. I was very nervous about this because Grandma was such a good cook. I didn't want her to know that I don't even like to cook. I know that I'm good enough when I do it. Things taste good enough but it doesn't taste like hers and I didn't want her to be disappointed in me. Everybody was having fun. The overall feeling was very light and happy. We were talking and laughing."
"0833"	"(2004-04-27)"	"I was back in high school and in some kind of sewing class. Peggy B from SDI was in this class as well. I think we had finished one semester and had returned to start the next semester. Peggy B was doing something different this semester that screwed up our schedule. The previous semester we had been paired up and worked on projects together in this one class. But this semester, whenever anyone was paired with her they didn't really have to do their part of the project. The project was sewing. The first week I was paired with Peggy B. She was making a duvet I believe. At the same time I was paired with a man that I remember from high school. His name was Tom A. I had gone to find him to tell him my idea that resulted from the situation with Peggy B. I found him in the library and he was sitting there with Mike Ke working on something. I went up to him and asked if I could interrupt. They were sitting at a library table across from each other. I just scrunched down."

"0835"	"(2004-04-28)"	"I had gone to a shopping mall. As I was driving through the parking lot I noticed how far away from the building some of the cars were parked. Then I realized that they belonged to employees. It was late in the afternoon. I was thinking that was a long way for employees to walk in the dark to get to their cars after the stores close. It was either kind or brave or both for them to park that far away so customers could park closer to the building. I wondered if the mall had a shuttle service to shuttle employees to their cars at night, to keep them safe. Then I remembered that a long time ago when I worked at the mall they didn't have such a service. I also didn't remember parking that far away or having to walk that far at night, which is when I usually worked."
"0836"	"(2004-04-30)"	"I'm in my birth home. I am outside looking at the flowerbeds and maybe watering the flowers. I'm down in the basement and somehow I realize that the house is beginning to lean. I'm having a conversation with someone about this and we're talking about what if anything we need to do about it. With Daddy's health as it is we don't want to get him involved. We want to take care of it for him. I don't know if it is a period of time but it becomes worse. It's not like we feel it beginning to lean or anything but it does become worse so we end up calling someone. The man that we called or the man that comes out is a second choice because the man we wanted either wasn't available or we couldn't get in touch with him. The man that comes out to help is named Mel Gibson. I can't decide if it was just the same name as the actor or if it was actually the actor. He is doing something to I can't picture how this happens, I can only describe it. He does something to start pulling the house. I can picture him placing a tool somewhere high up against some walls. That is somehow supposed to. It almost reminds me of a vice and as he tightens it the walls are supposed to be straightening. At this point the walls of the second floor, at least in this area, it starts to collapse almost like it's falling to the side. It's not falling apart or collapsing like a house of cards. It's all moving. All the walls of the second floor are falling to one side to the point that no one can even stand on the second floor anymore. I think someone is trapped there. Not hurt though. I slither up the floor in one room on my stomach to grab something I'm afraid of losing or getting crushed or lost. As I get back out he is able to get the walls back upright and then this other person gets out as well. It's odd that it hasn't done any damage that needs to be repaired. It just pulls it back upright. There is still more to done. I mean it isn't exactly how it should be yet. There is some discussion that while we're doing this we're going to need something on the outside of the house to keep this in place, like a dump truck. We need to have someone bring a dump truck full of dirt to pour some dirt into the open area that is left by this wall straightening back up. I tell someone that we should go ahead and call them and have them come and be filling that in as he is straightening the house. I thought that would be smarter to do it at the same time. That way when the house is straight it will also be stable."
"0837"	"(2004-05-02)"	"I went up to church to participate in some kind of exercise session with my CRHP sisters. There was also something about being in the parking lot and I was trying to decide where to park. When I got there, there were a ton of people around. I went into a very large room, unlike in my waking life church. It had rows of chairs in it. The chairs were similar to those in our waking life chapel. Everyone was congregating in there. I wasn't sure if I was in the right place. I saw Helen J so I approached her and we talked a little bit. We were going to go find a place to sit down. I decided I needed to go to the bathroom but I didn't know if we were getting ready to start or what was going on. She told me that I should go ahead and go and she would hold the stuff I had with me - some papers and 2 or 3 pens. I gave her the booklets and papers but I was going to stick the pens in my pocket. Then it looked like we were going to have a prayer service or a Mass before the exercise session so I decided to wait. She told me again to go ahead now. I went ahead and I had to cross over a center aisle that they had created with these rows of chairs. I crossed the aisle as soon as Father and the servers had gone up to start Mass. When I got to the side aisle it seemed that the grade school children had come in for Mass. They had come in from the other direction so I waited until they all got by. There was a wall full of windows. In the hallway on the other side of that wall there were a lot of grade school children standing there - the older children. Some were standing right by the windows and some were standing back a little way. I worked my way between them to get to the women room. At the time I was thinking that I was glad that I wasn't a teacher that I wouldn't do very well with all of these small children. I was having trouble finding the women room but I don't know why because I knew where it was. When I got to the end of the hallway to my right there was what looked like a gym area but it didn't have the typical wood floor. I was having trouble seeing a partition between where this gym area and the Mass was. There were people there. There were young men playing basketball there. I was wondering if that wasn't going to disturb the Mass. But I could tell they were very conscious of this and trying not to be disruptive. I saw lots of doors that were entrances to mens rooms and maybe even a locker room. Now I'm driving and I'm going to drop something off someplace that the church had asked about or asking for donations for. I was going to drop those off. I was driving through Osborn I think. I didn't get directions because I knew I had been to the place before that I was going to drop these things off. I didn't think I would have trouble finding it. As I was driving through Osborn I suddenly realized that they had several inches of snow, maybe 5 or 6. The roads were kind of bad. I saw the place I was looking for just as I passed it. I thought to myself that I had done the same thing the last time. I was going to find a driveway to turn around in but I wanted to find one that was very wide so I would have to pull in but could just use it to do more of a U-turn. I finally found one and it did that. I went back to the place that I needed to be to drop off whatever it was that I was donating. I went inside and there were a few people there. I was talking to them and they were showing me something. There was some kind of material that they were going to be mailing out and showing me the pocket folders that they were going in. I said, Oh, you're going to be using pocket folders. She looked at me like she was annoyed. I said I was sorry - that I misunderstood. I didn't think they were going to be using pocket folders. Then I asked her if the pocket folders belonged to the church. She didn't know so she pulled one out and showed it to me. I said that they didn't belong to the church. The reason was that I was concerned about the expense and I didn't think they needed to be using pocket folders. If they were going to be using these that belonged to the church then it didn't matter to me anymore. This is contradictory but that's the way it was recorded. I thought it looked nice but I still didn't think they needed to be using pocket folders. Then I was standing by this table and there were something like looked like three-ring binders laying there for different things. Then the pocket folders that she showed me then. One side had stair-stepped literature and the other one had several different pieces of literature in it that were all the same size. This was a different one than she showed me because the things they were putting in them were the same size as the pocket and I thought that those would get lost behind the pocket which is why I didn't see why they were using them. This other pocket folder she showed me with the literature in it, on each stairstep piece you could see someone's picture. The other pocket had several 8 1/2 x 11 pieces in that pocket. At the table where the 3-ring binder were each binder represented a different time that this event had taken place. Each binder was a different generation of whatever it was that they were doing. I started talking to someone about the weather because I was wearing a very summery dress. I was wearing a dress that I owned around 1989. It had a light blue background with bright colored geometric shapes in it-pink, deeper blue, purple. I remember the approximate year because of where I was working at the time. I loved that dress. It was one of my favorites at the time. It had short sleeves and it was made out of a silky material. The skirt had a bit of a trumpet shape so it was very flowing, flattering and girly. I was saying that I was so surprised by this snow. Here I was wearing this very summery dress and I didn't even have a jacket on. Someone said something to me. I said I was on my way to meet my sister and maybe some of my other family. I said I was going to call my sister and try to catch her before she leaves and see if she can bring along a sweater or jacket. I was talking about BJ."

This dream was kind of an extension of that special where they were continuing to interview the actors and writers from the program. In particular they were talking about how some or all of the actors may reunite on the spin-off program. One thing in particular that I remember is that they should all reunite at Thanksgiving because on the program the six of them always spent the holiday together."

I had all the windows open because I didn't want to turn the air conditioning on but I knew he probably preferred that I have it on.

I don't remember whose or why. After I left I was having trouble remembering how to get back to my own cabin. I walked one direction and I saw a big highway and knew that wasn't the right direction because I hadn't seen it before. Then I started another direction and ran into someone else and said I was having trouble remembering how to get back. I think that he was going to help me. I mentioned the highway that I saw. I think he said something to the effect that he didn't even know it was there. There was also something in the dream about a costume but I don't know what it was, what it was for or anything else. Then there was a discussion, I think as I was walking I ran into another couple that I started a conversation with. We sat down to talk for a little while and they ended up discussing a possible job opportunity. I talked to them quite a bit. I didn't tell them that I didn't think it was the right thing for me. There was some kind of trust or morality issue. Apparently I was there with a bunch of people I knew. Later I was in a room with these people and they come up to. They were fairly upset because they had heard that I had said something to someone about our conversation. I said that I had to tell the person I was supposed to meet because I was late due to my conversation with them. I had to tell that person something to explain why I was late. I just said I was talking with them, not what we discussed. I don't know if the person I met told them I had said something to him about a job opportunity or what. I think they assumed that I told him what we talked about."

"0846"	"(2004-05-15)"	"I was in my car driving down a narrow, winding road that looked like it was on the side of a mountain. I couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me. It was dusk, not totally dark and the road was black, which made it even more treacherous. I quickly realized I was going way too fast and that I was in a very dangerous situation. I applied my brakes to try to stop and then proceed very slowly. I couldn't stop and it hardly felt that I slowed down at all. Snow appeared on the ground. I thought the road was now covered by snow so I couldn't even see if I was still on the road. I realized that I was no longer on the road but the depth of the snow slowed me down and caused me to come to a stop. There were people walking nearby who approached my car to see if I was okay and to see if I could help. One man's name was Bryan Thomas [unknown in waking life] . We were in a room talking when he said something that implied he was supposed to meet me and he just realized why - that we are to be life partners. Oddly, I didn't feel any strong emotion around this one way or the other. He was a physically nice looking man, not much taller than I with thick, black hair. But I didn't know him or know anything about him as a person so there was no reason for me to feel excited about this prospect or to feel anything negative about it. He didn't exhibit much emotion around it either, one way or the other. He did seem ready to accept the idea and move forward to make it reality. I did appreciate that he seemed to be a nice man and that he wanted to help with my car situation."
"0847"	"(2004-05-15)"	"I was in the CAS office with Bill C and Jane C. At least Bill C and I were sitting at a large round table that was covered with paper. We were working on various things, discussing things that needed to be done etc. I believe we came across an invoice that was overdue. He got angry with me because he had just come back from the accountant's office and thought he should have had that with him. He told me I am responsible for making sure he has things like that on a timely basis and when he needs them. I was thinking that Jane C does the internal accounting and he pays a professional accounting firm to work with her, and I rarely even see the invoices. I wasn't sure how I could be responsible for this. He right away got angry and said something about me not thinking he should hold me responsible for this. I was getting very upset and frustrated because I didn't know what to do or say. After he left, Jane C said something to me to try to reassure me and make me feel better. It helped a little hearing her say whatever it was."

Her friend was standing at the passenger side, I think saying good-bye. Jo V had her window down. At first I just waved and kept walking, then realized she might be on her way back home or maybe I wanted to find out where she was going. I went over to the car and leaned in through the window and gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Someone said something about her not going out much, or not going out at all to do anything while she was there. I'm not sure which of the three of us said it. I didn't make a big deal about it because I know Jo V likes her time alone. But I also know that when her and Jan F come to visit they do usually go out and do something. Now I'm standing with Jan F and the other woman in front of one of their cars. Jan F is checking her oil. I said something to Jan F about the fact that her and Jo V did not go out anywhere during this visit. She looked at me, kind of sideways - turning her head slightly down and to the left - look at me from the top of her eyes. She said that her and Jo V are thinking about breaking up over this. I said I recognized that it was unlike the two of you not to go out during your visit. It seems that this third person is part of the problem though also. As though either Jo V or Jan F saw her as a threat to their relationship - that the other might have a romantic interest in her."

It seems that there was one attached to each classroom but I didn't want to use that one so I went out into the hall looking for another one. There had been special signs made because of this event and they were hanging on the doors of the restrooms. I found the women room and went in. As I using it I saw a woman talking to her daughter. I looked at someone else and we kind of half-grinned at each other. I don't remember what she was saying. Maybe she was toilet-training this little girl. It seems that some of the people that I knew, a number of the people at this event, in fact it was some people from my own grade school. Paulette W and Cindy S were both there."
"0851"	"(2004-05-20)"	"At least three of the characters are the three judges from the TV program American Idol. There were stacks of paper, shrink-wrapped. There is something about whether or not there is enough copies in these stacks or as many as there should be or if it is something about each individual dictates which stack they get based on what they deserve or what they earn or what they qualify for or what they worked for. There is something special about it though too. The stacks are in different places but I can't see them sitting on anything. It's almost as though all of these elements are there yet. It's like I know the judges are there but they aren't sitting in a row together at a table like they would be on the TV program. It's as though they aren't even standing together at all. They are each in a different place, yet they're observing or guiding. It seems that I move from one stack of papers to another to another and I don't know if one of them is for me or if I'm just acting as, to guide other people or to explain it to other people. I don't know what my role is there."
"0852"	"(2004-05-20)"	"I took my car to the dealership to get some repair work done. I was sitting in the parking lot waiting for one of the employee's to come out. I'm not sure why. I had the engine turned off and didn't even have my hands on the steering wheel. I felt my car starting to move. It was very slight and gentle, a kind of rocking movement, forward and backward. It became more and more pronounced. Then I realized that the car was backing out of the parking space. I sat very upright in my seat and was looking out all the windows. There was no one around. I felt the car rub against the bumpers of another car as it backed out of the parking space. It was doing this all on it's own without the engine running. It moved all the way across the parking lot and backed into an angled parking space. I tried to start the engine but it wouldn't start. I tried to move the car and it wouldn't move again. I went into the dealership and found my rep and told him what happened. He looked at me like I was crazy but they were going to go out and check it out. They did and realized what I was saying was true. They couldn't get it to start or to move either. I was sitting there waiting while they were trying to figure out what was wrong or what was going on. They were going to give me a replacement car to drive while they figured this out and repaired the car. I didn't want to do that because I had brought the car in for a very simple repair that was only supposed to take a few minutes. I just wanted my own car back and I wanted to go home. I ended up sitting there for a long time. Different people kept coming up. Finally they said they had gotten it taken care of and my rep drove up in this huge black van. It was almost the size of a utility van but it had windows in it just like a passenger van. He drove up like this was my vehicle. I was standing there talking to someone else and stopped. I said, No. That is not my car. I want my car. I want to take my car home. I just want my car back and drive it home. They were trying to convince me that this was my car. I was getting more and more upset and being adamant that this was not my car. I put my hand up to where the top of the roof of my car would be and told them my car was a sedan. There were a couple of men standing there along with the woman I had been talking to. They tried to calm me down. They had me go sit down someplace while they tried to locate my car. At this point I'm sitting there watching some of the employees at the dealership interact with each other. I don't think there were any other customers around at the time. Four of the employees were young men. Three of the four had guitars. One of them was wearing a very funky hat and had it on backwards. They were playing the guitars and singing some kind of goofy songs and being very playful. Nearby there were several female office workers who were standing and singing along and clapping. I was thinking how nice it was that they had this kind of atmosphere at work where they could have fun, be playful, and get along so well. I got up and walked to what was maybe the office area. There were several carpeted steps, 4-6, that led up to an open area. I sat down on the top step and the office area was to my left. The area to the right looked like a long hallway except there was no wall along the front. Someone came up the steps so I scooted over so there was plenty of room for them to get by me. There was a door directly behind me that they went through. As I sat there the number of women to my left working increased as did the physical space. The space was now a huge long hallway with a wall in front of me and it has windows. It had a very high ceiling. It reminds me of the inside of a castle. There were two people that I'm observing. One is either telling a story or singing a song. The other one agrees to portray either the opposite or the dark side of whatever the first one is talking or singing about it. In doing so, he becomes this character that kind of reminds me of the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, except that he is a very dark, scary character. At the end he has his arms straight out like a scarecrow and there is fire or smoke coming out of the end of his sleeves. When the first man finishes his story or his song, the second man says something about it being so dark. The first man tells him that he is the one who wanted to play the dark character. Why did you make it so dark? The second man just walked away with the smoke still coming out of his sleeves. He comes back and the first man leans through the wall, disappearing. The second man pulls him back in. They're talking about whether this was reality or not. Now Bev is sitting there with me and she is watching me watch them. She has this big smile on her face. I said, Well the scary thing is that could all be true. Then I said, What are you smiling about? She said, I'm just smiling watching your mind work on this. I can just see your mind working on all this."
"0853"	"(2004-05-21)"	"I went to NTNS. It was a house with hardly any windows on the front. When you walked in the front door there was a very large room. No cash register. No counter. There were a few racks with coats on them. They were having a sale. They were selling consignment coats at 40% off and other coats at 25% off. This made no sense to me so I questioned it two or three times. I asked to clarify because it made no sense to me. I thought this was par for the course with where they were headed with the shop. Then I saw a woman standing there taking cash. She had a little metal cash box. That was when I realized that they had done away with the counter and the cash register in the store. They didn't have many customers. Maybe just one or two at a time. Now I'm sitting on the floor with Jane H and Janet S. There are two pieces of furniture, like a chest of drawers and a bureau in medium dark wood. I said something to them about them working there. They said there really isn't much for them to do anymore so they spend most of their time just sitting there. I realized that they probably didn't enjoy that but wondered then why they would stay when they like to stay very busy. I didn't say anything to them, that I thought it must be hard for them to just be sitting around all the time."
"0854"	"(2004-05-21)"	"I am at the CAS office but with a very odd combination of people. Susan J is there. I went back to the coat closet, but it is much longer than it is in waking life. We had a lot of different stuff stored in there. There were clothes on hangers and boxes of dishes. Sue P came in. Now it seems that I'm working someplace where, maybe it is DDSI because Vince P and Sue P own it. Sue P comes in and I'm explaining all of this stuff in this closet, how all of these clothes are in there and we have no idea who they belong to and they're taking up space. We really need the space to store other things. She says that we should get rid of it. She tells me to take it out and she will take it to Goodwill. I start packing the stuff in boxes. Sue P and Susan J are helping me. Sue P and Chris H are carrying things out to her car. Some things are already in boxes in the closet so they can just carry those directly to the car. We're making a lot of progress. At some point Vince P comes in and voices his concern about what we're doing. He's concerned that we're giving away something that we shouldn't. Sue P wasn't concerned and she is the one that told me to start packing it up to give it away and in fact she is helping. So we all continue confident in what we're doing, that we're not giving away anything that we shouldn't. After we get that done I'm taking a bunch of binders and putting them in boxes so they will be easier to store. Chris H is taking all of the boxes of the new binders that we got and putting them into the closet so they are stored much nicer. Now this closet looks deeper than it does in waking life, has a much taller ceiling, and is much brighter or well-lit inside. Chris H is stacking these boxes of binders very high. He puts a couple of them in there, maybe in a different box. I'm concerned about how stable they are, that they may fall. Rather than saying that I say that I think we have enough room that we don't need to stack them like that. I suggest we take a couple of them down and start a new stack so he does that. We get down to one last box. I have a bankers box and I'm putting miscellaneous types of binders in it and then let Chris H put that in the closet."
"0855"	"(2004-05-23)"	"I was observing Bill C driving across the parking lot. I think he was on his way to an appointment with WI. Now I'm driving through the parking lot and heading to a place in the parking lot that makes the most sense to cut across to get to the street that I want. Now I'm walking through a parking lot of a strip center, where there is a row of stores. I see ahead and to my left the back of a building. There is just a few feet between the back of the building and a tall construction fence. Coming towards me from that little opening is Wes S. I wait to say hello to him. We talk very briefly. He is working in town and I'm on my way to work. I think he asks me where I'm working now. I tell him that I'm going to be working at a little pharmacy for a little while, that I'm substituting. I struggled to remember the name of it. I finally told him that the name of it was H's. I don't think we ever just stood still and talked. We must have both been in a hurry. He kind of grinned at me, waved and went on. As I'm walking I realize that it isn't H's, it's Mallards and it is a local high school that has a pharmacy inside. That is where I'm headed to work. I'm carrying a couple of things so my hands are full. I have a cord around my neck with a key on it. When I first get to the high school I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong place. Maybe this really isn't where I'm supposed to be. Then I decide that it is. The front of the building, the school is shaped kind of like an arch, like the bottom of a U, not really like an arch, it has three wings. In the middle section at the front of the building there are rows of balloons hanging down vertically. I think they are blue and silver. They are celebrating some kind of championship. I went inside and there are a lot of people coming in at once, a lot of adults. I don't see any students. I think I asked someone to point me in the direction of the pharmacy. I get to the pharmacy and the door is locked. There are several adults waiting to get in. One woman is trying her key but it doesn't work. She said something about Mallard's key being the only one that works, the only one that will open the door. I said something to the effect that my key says Anna Mallard so maybe it will work. I went and tried it and it opened the door right up. I can see that there is a woman there that is miffed that I have a key that opens the door. We went inside. It doesn't look like a pharmacy but more like a small gymnasium. There are rectangular tables set up in a T shape. They have blue tablecloths on them."
"0856"	"(2004-05-24)"	"I was working on my houseplants. I had some square flower pots that were maybe 6-inch square. I could put a row of them inside a window frame and have a row of them fit exactly, snugly inside the frame. I think I was either planting seeds or starter plants because I couldn't see anything growing. I think initially I was wondering either if they were going to fit or how they were going to fit. It turned out that they were an exact fit."
"0857"	"(2004-05-30)"	"I was staying at the BE Retreat Center. We were having our retreat for the end of SDI. Sister Toni was my spiritual director. We were having a special Mass at the end. We were given very specific instructions not to come I the main door and no other. There was a door that many people used frequently during other occasions but they wanted to make sure we did not use that entry for this occasion. I guess I forgot because I am came in that door anyway. It was 5:45 and the Mass was to begin at 6. I had my sewing machine with me. When I got down there actually I think I had either forgotten about the whole thing or didn't realize what time it was. When I arrived in the chapel I saw everyone there and all dressed up and realized what was going on. I went over to the entrance where we were supposed to come in. They said something to me about coming in the wrong door and also about having my sewing machine with me. I didn't want to admit that I had forgotten about the whole thing or not realized what time it was, I was thinking of saying, At least I'm on time. But I don't think I said it. They told me I had to get rid of my sewing machine quickly and that I had better be back on time. I went outside to take the machine to my car. It was a long walk and up a steep hill. You couldn't even see the parking lot from where I was. I started walking up the sidewalk on this hill. The machine was so heavy that it was slowing me down. I thought it would be faster if I sat the machine on the floor and pushed it up the hill. As I was doing this, bobbins kept falling off into the grass along the sidewalk. I had to keep stopping to pick them up - gather them up. People were watching me. When I got to the top of the hill I saw a big cement area set up with folding chairs. There were people arriving and taking their seats there. This area was for people attending the Mass that couldn't get a seat in the chapel, because the chapel was too small for everyone. They had a large screen TV or something like that set up for the people sitting out here to watch what was going on inside. Now it seems that I had gone outside and up this hill to get back to my room rather than to my car. I went to the wall that people were facing to go into the building. I grabbed a door that I wasn't even sure it was a door or an entry. I had to get down on my hands and knees again. Then I saw that it did go into where I wanted to be. It was a small square opening. I crawled in and then stood up. It looked like a narrow hallway straight in front of me. At the end of that hallway I had to either go left or right onto another hallway. Along that hallway was a bunch of sets of double doors. I entered one set of these double doors and Sister Toni was in there waiting for me for a session. We had our session. Elvis Presley was at a restaurant. He was having a meal and I think he had been drinking because he was very upset about something that had happened. There are some people with him that are only about 6-12 inches tall. They are living people. Myself and someone else decided to offer to take him back to the BE Retreat Center to try to hide him from the public so they wouldn't know what was going on but also to help him. We took him back there and gave him a room. At some point I ended up going back to the chapel. I had one or two flights of steps to go down to get there. They were very wide, wide enough for maybe 12 people and they were painted a dark green. They had a banister that looked like a steel pipe, but also painted green. I was really rushing to get to the chapel on time. I could tell Mass was starting because I heard the music. I decided it would be faster if I floated down the steps rather than taking each step. So I somehow lifted myself off of the floor, leaned slightly back and to my left side and then floated or flew down the steps. When I got to the bottom of the steps I went around the corner and saw the entrance to the chapel. Someone is standing there waiting for me. She is wearing black slacks and a white blouse, corsage and name tag. She has a name tag for me. She said something about me getting there when I did."
"0858"	"(2004-05-31)"	"I was going on a date, so to speak, with Dwight W. I had misgivings about going on a date with Dwight W but decided to go ahead. We were going somewhere with a lot of other people that we know, some of them members of my family. It was somewhere around St. Joe and outdoors where there were lots of beautiful flowers. I had a broken leg and been confined to home for a few weeks. Dwight W came in and was going to carry me to the car. I told him if he just helped me up I could get to the car myself. I hopped on my good foot to the car and was surprised at how easily I was able to do it. I realized that I was healing very well. Driving to where ever it was that we were going I was impressed by how Dwight W and others remembered exactly how to get there after living away from there for so many years, because I know I would not have. We seemed to be driving on a very narrow dirt path, that at one point involved a hairpin turn. The trees and flowers and such seemed to be right next to the edge of the path where we were driving on both sides. It was so beautiful there."
"0859"	"(2004-06-01)"	"I was at my birth home. There were a lot of people there. Maybe there was a party or something going on. I had gone upstairs to use the bathroom. Someone had used it and did not flush the toilet. I thought maybe they had not flushed because they were afraid it would overflow. So I pressed the handle to flush it and then ran out of the bathroom because I didn't want to have to clean it up if it did overflow. I thought I would go back in a little while. I went outside through the back door that we always used in waking life. When I came back in a few minutes later, Mother was mopping the kitchen floor but she also had a bunch of white towels on the flower to help her mop up. The towels were all brown and nasty. I knew that the toilet had overflowed all the way out into the kitchen. She looked at me kind of mad, as though she knew what I did. I didn't want to admit it. I think I told her that I went in to use the bathroom, saw that someone had not flushed it, so I flushed it and left. I don't think I told her the rest."
"0860"	"(2004-06-05)"	"I was living on Lakeland Dr. I was planting new flowers and working on existing flowers. My family was coming for a visit. I was pulling up weeds/flowers from a large flowerpot on the deck and pointing out to Matthew which ones I was pulling up and why. Some of them were the sunflower seeds from the birds, that were sprouting and I didn't want them growing there. I kept waiting and waiting and finally realized that my family isn't going to show up. Since I had plenty of time now, I start moving things where I want them, from having put them or left them someplace that would suffice until after the family left. I gathered up three empty cardboard boxes that had each been sitting in various places. They are three different sizes. I put them inside each other and then put a bunch of small pieces of wood, looked like kindling, into the smallest one. At first I was going to trash the stuff that I put in there then I thought I would store the wood that way. I had taken a bunch of very large wood items and threw them over the deck fence to be taken to the trash. One in particular that I remember was a very large, black kidney-shaped piece of furniture that I had torn apart. When I realized I had plenty of time I asked Matthew to help me take that stuff to the trash. I took all the small flower pots and stuff (like what is sitting on the patio in waking life), gathered them all together and moved them all onto or to a different place on the deck. I moved at least some of them onto a silver aluminum rolling cart. Tonya H was there. She came out to the deck and began helping me. She was going to take one or some of these flower pots. I was fine with that. I had a young African-American boy living or staying with me. He was about 10-12 years old. He considered me a mother figure, but I don't know why. He started helping me with the trash and stuff without being asked. I noticed this and was impressed and pleased by this. I was thinking about Matthew in relation to this. Numerous times I walked from the front of the house around the outside to the back. I seldom went out back through the patio doors. Maybe because I was carrying things like flowers and trash? Maybe because of dirt? I don't know."
"0861"	"(2004-06-08)"	"I was thinking about the fact that Matthew did not get to receive his First Communion with the rest of his class. Because he was at his Dad's every other weekend I quit making the effort to take him to religious education classes that year, so he couldn't make his First Communion. I got a book and I was talking to him about home preparing him, myself, so he could receive this sacrament."
"0862"	"(2004-06-08)"	"I was dressed for work, a skirt, blouse and heels. I was out someplace - maybe at a shopping center. I was in the parking lot and I saw Aunt H with two or three other people. She was coming to her car and was just two or three cars away from me. I was standing my by car and another car. I called out to her. Aunt H. Aunt H. She's looking around to see who is calling her name. I'm waving my hand in the air and she finally sees me. I go up to her and I gave her a hug and asked her what she is doing in town. She said they came up to surprise mother. As I'm standing there talking to her, other members of the family walk up. We're no longer surrounded by parked cars, but we're in an open area. As other members of the family walk up they form a small circle and some are standing at the perimeter of this small circle. I think Larry K and Dick W are both there. They are both going on and on telling me how great I look - that they can't believe I good I look. I tell them that I've lost weight and I'm trying to take better care of myself. They're just really surprised how good I look. They're doing something and getting ready to go see Mother. I think some of them are kind of dressed up too. I think Larry and Dick W are both wearing suits or at least dress shirts and ties. They had prepared food ahead of time and brought it with them. Now I'm standing someplace with Aunt H. I think she's rearranging some of the food. She has one round container and she has little wedges of some kind of food.bread, or coffee cake, or not sure. It does have some kind of topping on it. I'm helping her and taking these wedges and putting them in this container. She says something to me about the topping on it and making sure not to knock it all off. As I'm putting it in there I keep one piece out and start eating it. She asks me if I want a piece. I indicate that I already took one and do something to indicate a thank you. I don't think I actually say thank you. She has a bunch of very small empty containers with lids. I realize that she brought those along for the leftovers, to make the food easier to take home."
"0863"	"(2004-06-09)"	"I had gone on retreat, either a silent retreat or a prayer retreat, though I've never heard of a prayer retreat. I had gone to this retreat center. It had several buildings on the property. I was driving around trying to find the right building. I think it is now the next morning and I had slept in fairly late. I had to go to a different building to take my shower. It was around 11 am. There was a big common shower area, though it had separate stalls with shower curtains on each. The shower curtains were on a rod that was rectangular in shape with rounded corners. The curtains covered three sides. The fourth side was the wall with the faucets. Jo V and Jan F were there. They were showing me, or talking to me something about the showers. I had set down my toiletries and someone who worked at the retreat center was there to kind of oversee things and make sure that everyone had what they needed. Jo V and Jan F had walked away and come back a little later. I still had not taken my shower. I was just fiddling around - I don't know what I was doing. Jan F said something to me about not having started taking my shower yet. I said, yes, I no. I'm having trouble getting situated. I finally pulled one of the shower curtains shut and started the water. Then I realized that my toiletries were on the other side of the room. I grabbed a towel around me, ran across the room and grabbed my shampoo and stuff and came back. When I got out of the shower I ran into Margie D. She told me that her and Dennis D were there for the retreat as well. They were just getting ready to have breakfast, but that Dennis D had gone ahead and gotten their food for them while Margie D took her shower. I was glad to know that there was still a meal available, that I hadn't totally missed breakfast. I thought I would go ahead and get my food and then sit with Margie D and Dennis D and talk with them a bit. This would mean it wasn't a silent retreat. There was also something about some dogs and maybe there was someone there who was training seeing eye dogs or maybe they had seeing eye dogs available for people who needed them at the retreat."
"0864"	"(2004-06-11)"	"I'm in California and driving down a very busy highway. At first I'm in the far right lane. Everyone is driving very fast. There isn't much room between me and the vehicle in front of me. The car behind me starts approaching very fast. I decide to get over one lane to the left so I'm not right on the tail of the pick-up truck in front of me. The truck is white with a wide, red, horizontal strip on each side. The driver is a very thin man wearing a cowboy hat. They are very country people, though I don't know how I know that. That whole lane, it seems that the vehicles are all way too close to each other - especially for driving at such a high speed. After a little bit I decide to get back over when I see a rather large opening. Just as I do I see that there is an unmarked police car sitting ahead of me at an angle, to where the back of the car is protruding into the lane a bit. That police car is backing into that lane and then shifts into forward, swerves around and then pulls across all three lanes. The cars are still driving very fast and are still very close together. The police car cuts it very close, cutting across those three lanes between all that traffic. With him doing that I had to slam on my brakes as did some other people. It caused a major accident that I was a part of. As I slammed on my brakes I began sliding as did other cars. Our tires were squealing. When I finally came to a stop, my car was teetering on the edge of what looked to be a huge cliff. If I had to guess it was several thousand feet drop off. My car was totaled. My arms were straight out in front of me but I couldn't move because of the way the car was smashed together. I saw out of the corner of my eyes that one or more people walked up to the car to see if I was still alive. I had my eyes open so hopefully they saw that. I was thinking that I hope they can see that I am still conscious and alive. But I couldn't move enough to let them know that. Plus, my car was teetering on this edge, like it was half over this edge. Even if I could have moved I would have been afraid to for this reason. I'm not exactly sure how, but the people who had gotten out of their cars, I don't know if they were part of the crash or if they had stopped to help. Somehow they got my car pulled back enough so I was no longer in danger of going over this cliff. Now we are all standing around and it seems that there is a swimming pool area and there are some people sitting there. Someone said something about everything reminding them of fruit. Like bright colors of red, and orange and yellow. Then we noticed that the pool was filled with something that wasn't liquid. We start by taking two hands and scooping whatever is in the pool out and tasting it. I made the comment that, I think I said that it either tasted like Fruit Loops or Lucky Charms cereal. There is also a scene where I am at a department store looking at lingerie but it's all displayed right around the cash register and some of it was hard to get to and to look at. Someone is talking to someone else and filling out receipt forms by hand. They are two or three part forms. I see the pink copy lying there and two of the women who work there are talking. Someone said that this will now tell them if things have been getting stolen. This will not only help prevent theft but I think because it will help prevent theft it will tell them if the store has been suffering a lot of loss due to theft. It seems that the employee who had the idea to implement this is either in a management position or maybe responsible for store security. It's Amy Wynn from the TV program Trading Spaces."
"0865"	"(2004-06-13)"	"I had gotten my paperwork back for my fall student loans and there was some kind of problem with getting my loans that I had to get taken care of. I went to some office and the parking lots were very odd in terms of people coming and going. It was also pretty full. I was headed down an aisle in the wrong direction so I pulled into one space and then was backing up so that I could head in the right direction. But I was also going to back up enough to pull into one space. There was a semi-trailer truck parked in the space to my left and another car in the space to my right. They were both facing me, like they had pulled in from the wrong direction also. There was a woman sitting in the car to my right. As I started to pull in I realized that I couldn't pull straight in because of the way the trailer truck was parked. I started to try it anyway but then decided it would be too risky trying to get out. I had just barely backed up at all and the woman in the car to my right started to back out of her space. I thought she was leaving. So as she was backing out I started pulling in. Then she stopped and moved forward a little bit so I stopped too. I was going to back up and then I saw that there was someone backing out from the row behind me. I almost hit them. I would have hit them if I had continued to back up. The woman finally got out of that space so I went ahead and pulled in. I started to get out of the car. As I did another woman came running towards me and she had two little manila-colored envelopes, what I would call coin envelopes, in her hand. She handed one to one person and then gestured at me. I rolled my window down and she handed the other to me through the window. She said something to me and then started to run away. I said, So I need to do this before I come back? I think she said yes. I rolled up my window and looked at it. There was two things written on the envelope. It said, call. Under that it said Bill $531. Under that it said Student Loan and another amount. Bill and Student Loan were both marked with a yellow highlighter. What this apparently meant was that I had to call these two people and resolve. I think what this meant is that I had these amounts outstanding that had to be paid before I could get my fall student loan. I thought that was weird because how would they even know about the money I owe Bill F. But also, that's not really past due or anything because I'm not on a payment schedule with him. I went ahead and backed out and was driving home and thinking about what I needed to do to take care of this."
"0866"	"(2004-06-13)"	"Matthew was about 7-8 years old. He came and climbed in my lap. He was Darren's son by another woman and he was asking me about his birth mom and if she just didn't want him. I sat and was assuring him that was not at all the case. Later he asked if Angie Ho was his birth mom. I said I honestly didn't know and that he would have to ask his Dad."
"0867"	"(2004-06-13)"	"I went to Mass or some special service and I walked into church just as Father and the servers were walking to the back of the church to start Mass. I stood there for a minute and debated whether or not to go ahead of them and get a seat or wait for them to walk to the sanctuary and then follow behind them and get a seat. As they came back they headed out into the foyer so everyone started getting out of their seats and going into the foyer. I did the same. When I got into the foyer I debated whether to stop by the doors so that when we were ready to go back in I could get a seat where I wanted easier or if I should walk across to the other side of the foyer and still be one of the last ones in. That way I wouldn't risk taking the seat of someone who had been there before me. I finally decided to cross over to the far side of the foyer and be one of the last ones in."
"0868"	"(2004-06-14)"	"I was attending some kind of large group event. It was a couple day event. I was there with a friend I think, though I knew a lot of the people who were attending. It was a group both men and women. There was one man in particular, he and I were flirting - very subtle - with each other throughout the event. In the morning my friend and I would come down to attend an event for that day and he would pull up a chair to a table where I was going to sit or where I was sitting. Things like that. There were other events where it was a group of people presenting, like at a conference. The seating was almost like a gymnasium. They were tiered and long rows. I snuck in almost last minute and walking across the front to find a seat but there was one section that was saved for certain people. At first I sat down right at the end of a row of that section and then later I got up and tried to inconspicuously leave but I had to go clear across the room to get out. So, I went up to the very back and there was a walkway. There was a wall with openings like doorways and there was a long hallway behind that wall. So I went up and back there and went toward the other end but yet I didn't leave. One time when I went into an event, the man that was always making sure that I had a seat, there were a lot of people coming in at one time and he grabbed two chairs for someone else. Later he came up to me and I was teasing him for getting chairs for someone else and I had to find seat for myself. I could tell he was a bit flustered by that, not felt bad but that he did what he felt was the right thing to do but wished he could have gotten a seat for me or could have gotten to me quicker or wished that the timing had been better so that would have been taken care of before I showed up. I went to use the restroom and it looked like the person who had used it before me either hadn't flushed it or it hadn't flushed completely. I decided to flush it again before I used it and then I was going to come back in a couple of minutes to use it myself. After I flushed it I got concerned that it was going to overflow so I quickly did some things to shut it off. I pulled up the thing that would normally stop it from overflowing. I was watching it and it still started to overflow. I debated what to do. I did something else first and that wasn't helping so then I grabbed the tank lid off and grabbed this other thing. I finally got it to stop overflowing. Then I went and grabbed a sponge mop with the wringing mechanism on it because I was going to clean it up. I saw this man notice me doing it. I could tell he was involved in something else, wanted to come and help me but couldn't. I went ahead and was cleaning it up. I think Mother shows up and says something about me not cleaning it up good enough and what are they supposed to do after we all leave. I thought I was doing a decent job. I was getting to what I could without moving a bunch of furniture or anything. There were some chairs and sofas that it had flowed under. Until he walked up I hadn't intended to move that stuff to try to clean up under it. I don't know if I was thinking this or if I actually said it to her. No. I know I was just thinking, well what do you want me to do? I knew she wanted me to move that furniture and clean really good under everything and make sure that I got it all. I don't know if I ended up doing that or not."
"0869"	"(2004-06-19)"	"Matthew and I were on Trading Spaces. We were working with Edward. The color paint we were using on the wall was the same color we used in his room recently. We were doing a similar kind of paint treatment but it turned out a lot better in the dream. Edward was getting upset with me because I kept sleeping instead of working. At the end, when we finally got the room done, I think it was after the reveal, I went up to Edward and gave him a hug. I thanked him for all of his efforts and apologized for my sleeping so much. I told him that I had not been feeling well and didn't feel that I could help it. He was then very sympathetic and said he didn't realize that I hadn't been feeling well. He said he was sorry that I hadn't been feeling well and that he was glad that I was able to do as much as I did. Everything seemed okay between us then."
"0870"	"(2004-06-19)"	"I was working for CAS. I was out on the road but don't know if I was calling on prospective clients, clients, or preparing to do training. I was in a parking lot and getting ready to pull through a double row so I could pull back out easily. As I was preparing to pull into a space I saw that there were a lot of children walking around, getting ready to get on a school bus or some similar vehicle. I waited for them to get on the vehicle so I wouldn't risk their safety. As I put my car in park I was thinking that I needed either a map or atlas. I don't remember which one I pulled. I wanted to look up directions to where ever it was that I was headed. Someone that I was talking to thought I was in Elmwood or coming from Elmwood. I didn't get a chance to correct them and let them know that was not right. It seems to have something to do with University technology management offices."

"0872"	"(2004-06-23)"	"We were creating, decorating, bedrooms or something for two girls - I think they were twins. It almost seems that it might have been the actors Mary Kate and Ashley Olson. I don't think so, but at one point it seemed that we were doing a photo shoot. That's why I wonder if it was them. At first the girls were very awkward and didn't' know what to do but then we did something and they quickly got into it and it started going much better. They had a telescope and we were talking about not needing the top of the line telescope with all of the bells and whistles to be able to see some cool things. Somebody we were talking to didn't agree with us so someone was trying to set up one of the telescopes so they could see what we meant. Each of the girls had their own telescopes. Each one was a little different; they weren't the exact same one. During the photo shoot they changed clothes several times though I don't remember them actually doing that. In the dream it looked more like it would if you were watching it on TV where they are suddenly just in a different outfit. I know one of their outfit's was black and another was black with sequins or something like that on it. One was all red."
"0873"	"(2004-06-24)"	"I was walking through this town. I think that I decided to get something to eat, as it was dinnertime. Something reminded me of Frisch's. I hadn't been there in many years and I recalled that they had a sandwich that I used to love so I decided to go there. But I already had a sandwich in a bag from someplace else. I ran into a woman friend that I don't know in waking life as I was coming out of a Frisch's restaurant. She insisted on buying me an ice cream sundae. They had a sundae bar. I went in to get my sundae and was standing there waiting as the workers were doing something. They had several very large square/rectangular pans with things in them that they were stirring. It seemed that they were melting toppings maybe - heating them so they were smooth and more liquid. One had lots of lumps in it, it almost looked like beans. They were all various shades of brown. One thing I picked up the ladle and let some of the contents drip out and it seemed to be creamed corn instead of an ice cream topping. I went back out to the car where my friend was waiting. I opened the car door and handed her a strawberry parfait that I had bought earlier at Dairy Queen and had not finished yet and asked her to hold it for me while I went back in and got the ice cream sundae. I didn't really want both but she was insisting that I get a sundae from Frisch's. I went back inside and now they had moved the ice cream bar down to the other end of the restaurant. I went down. Now, instead of all the large pans they simply had jars of ice cream toppings sitting in a row on the table. There were probably 10-12 of them. I decided to get half butterscotch and half hot fudge with whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry on top."
"0874"	"(2004-06-24)"	"I decided to start refinishing one of the pieces of furniture in Matthew's room. It was a small piece, not one that he has in waking life. I hadn't cleaned it first. I had a partial spray can of primer so I thought I could at least do this one piece and see how it turned out before doing the others. I started spraying the outside of it with the primer. The bottom of this piece of furniture was open, with no drawers or doors. Then I started spraying the inside of the panels. There were two small stuffed animals sitting on the bottom of this part of it, along with some shelves and two small strips of wood. As I was spraying with one hand I was moving these things with the other. I didn't want to get primer on the stuffed animals. I didn't mind getting it on the shelves or wood strips because I was going to spray them anyway, but had to lay them out separately so I could do that, and move them so I could spray the area where they had been laying. Amy Wynn came in from the TV program Trading Spaces and was talking to me about what I was doing."
"0875"	"(2004-06-24)"	"I was talking to someone about the SDI program. The interns have to have a spiritual director while they are in the internship and they also must have at least one directee during the last year of their program. I was saying that I no longer see the directee that I had during my last year in the program. For each new group they would match up each intern with someone that had completed the previous internship. That person would be their spiritual director during their internship. I realized that this system worked out very well because they always had the same number of people in each internship - allowing for just enough directors for the interns. They wouldn't do this in waking life because it wouldn't be appropriate to dictate whom someone sees as a spiritual director and it wouldn't necessarily allow for the best match."
"0876"	"(2004-06-25)"	"Bill C and I were sitting in his office discussing various things, one of which was hiring a temp. We were also discussing acquiring new clients. I said something to him about the methodical way he does this - which he doesn't in waking life. I could tell by the look on his face that he was thinking that I would acquire more new clients if I had a plan and followed it. I got very upset and said this to him but also said that I do have a plan, but with my workload it is impossible to follow it - or to even get to it. He disagreed with me. Just then a pretty young woman came in and Bill C started asking her questions, and looking at me to imply that he could easily replace me and might do so with her. So I started asking her questions also. I asked her if she could do graphic design or editing and she said no. I asked her if she could fix computer problems. She said the computer was no problem. I clarified that I didn't mean the normal kinds of computer problems, but could she figure out computer issues that most people can't - the kind that normally require calling an IT professional. She said that she couldn't do that. I looked at Bill C and I could tell by the look on his face that he got it - that I have such a wide variety of skills that it would be very difficult for him to find someone with all of my skills that would be willing to work for him the way I do, the hours that I do, for what he is willing to pay me. I got up and walked out of the office, slamming the door behind me. As soon as the door slammed I realized that I shouldn't have done that. I thought that if he asked me about it I would just say I didn't intend to slam the door. I started to go for a walk. Our office was a small building on a large piece of land. A few seconds after I left the office Bill C came out. I was walking slowly and deliberately, trying to think things through. Bill C came along and was walking much faster; he quickly passed me and was walking a few paces ahead of me. I kept my own pace. He slowed down and guided me into a very small building, almost like a shed. There were some workers outside, working on landscaping of some sort. When Bill C led me into this building I said, Oh no. I knew this is where he took employees when he was going to fire them. He said, No. Don't worry. I was just cold. We each stood leaning our backs against opposite walls. The building was probably little more than 3 by 3 feet with wood floor, no windows, no light, and no furniture. We just stood there and looked at each other for a few seconds. I could feel the tension between us draining. I asked if I could have a hug. We have only hugged one other time in the 2.5 years I have worked for him, and that was at his Dad's funeral. He said absolutely. We moved close for a hug but there was a wooden door between us, standing alone. He was able to get his arms around both the door and me but I couldn't and said so. Then I moved my arms upward and just put my hands on his shoulders. I felt the rest of the tension between us resolve. We went back outside and there were a lot of people there now, I think they were clients. We were having some kind of an outdoor picnic. I had brought a cheesecake that actually had three different kinds of cheesecake in one pan. I started to cut it for some of our guests. Bill C wanted a piece so I started to get one for him. Then I realized that the piece I was about to give him wasn't chocolate so I moved the pan around to get a chocolate piece for him. I then cut pieces and gave them to two of our guests. They were talking about how good they were. I took a chocolate piece for myself. I was now lying on my stomach on the bench of a picnic table. I was thinking about everything that had just happened. We've been through a lot together in business in regards to our relationship. Our relationship has had some very lows and some real highs. In a romantic relationship a kiss is often sparked by some shared feeling about something, not at all always romantic love, attraction or anything like that. In many relationships a hug is often sparked by the same thing. Sometimes it's a way to connect or share a feeling of comfort or happiness or joy, or after resolving a problem. I think my wanting to hug Bill C at that time was a combination of comfort and having resolved our latest issue, or the feelings associated with a/the shared experience. People in romantic relationships or even friendships and relatives fight and then they can hug or kiss and makeup and it really helps the people move beyond the fight. Bill C and I don't have that advantage because it is not a romance. While we have agreed to substitute a handshake, sometimes the handshake just doesn't accomplish the same thing."

"0880"	"(2004-07-04)"	"I was working someplace that was also a hair salon. The owner was female. I asked her about my color and style. She started to change the color. It was late. After she applied it, she had to wait 25 minutes. In that time she fell asleep. When I tried to wake her up to finish she said she wouldn't, that she would finish tomorrow. I asked her if I could at least wash it out tonight and she told me I couldn't, that I needed to wait until tomorrow night. I left but forgot something and went back in. Nick, a hair stylist from a TV program was there. He was talking to her about fixing a room for some students. The room had four twin beds, each a small distance from each other. There was a smaller part of the room off of one of the long walls that held two beds. That was where the two supervisors, they were students but yet over the other students, would sleep. So they were fixing this up and getting ready because she hadn't had students in quite some time. I went back in the owner and Nick were flirting and dancing. I think I was putting blankets on the beds and somehow I got caught under one of them and they didn't know I was there. The owner was sitting on one of the beds and then Nick got on the bed also. He leaned over and I was fighting to get out from under the blanket. I finally went to my desk and was looking for my keys so I could leave. When I got ready to go there was a lot of snow outside. I was with Susan J and I asked her. As soon as I got out the door I realized that I had gone out the wrong way and my car wasn't there. I couldn't see it from where we were and I couldn't remember exactly where I had parked. I asked her to drive me to it. She wasn't happy about it but she said she would. We cleared the snow off of her car. When I opened the passenger car door I saw there was a couple of inches of snow inside the car also. She was cleaning the snow and ice off of the seats so we could get in. She drove me to find my car. For some reason she was not in her car now and she asked me to drive me to her car and I said absolutely. No problem. As I was taking her to her car we weren't in a car anymore. There was a bunch of furniture outside in the snow. There were some people there. Kendall B was laying on his back on one piece of furniture. I think he had been drinking and he was talking to someone else who was concerned about him. He had been drinking because he was upset about something. We were talking to him about all of the students or people that he mentors. He said, yeah. Yeah. But there was that one that was special. He was talking about me. He said I used to email him quite frequently with questions and things and now he hardly ever hears from me. Then all of a sudden he heard a sneezing in the snow and he spotted Susan J. He started chasing her with a gun. He took a couple of shots at her. I was running trying to get back to my car. I was trying to stay hidden behind the furniture so he wouldn't see me. I was running the opposite direction from Susan J. I felt bad that I wasn't running towards her but I knew that wasn't safest. I thought I would try to get to my car then I would take my car after Susan J. That would be the safest. I could help her best that way. I think Susan J did actually catch up. I did get to my car. Right after I got in I started to drive and called to her to hurry and jump in."
"0881"	"(2004-07-09)"	"I was working at my computer. I'm not sure if I was at the CAS office or at home or if I was doing CAS work, schoolwork, or something else. The impression that I have right now is that I had a number of Excel spreadsheets that had lists of things that I can best describe as characteristics or issues. For example, if I were writing something I might want to make a bulleted list of factors, characteristics, issues, etc that apply to or help to describe what I am writing about. It was information that anyone could use - not necessarily related to business or profession. There were then also separate, singular words that I can't even decide if they were written down somewhere, if I was viewing them on the computer or if they were just in my mind. There were two separate sources of the lists and of the singular words respectively. I was seeing the mental connection between the two, how one word was a perfect fit for one list, another word a perfect fit for another list and so on. So, for example, the list associated with communication were things that would help people to understand more about communication and could help them become much more effective communicators. They definitely felt like insights that would be knew to most people - not written about before. The more connections I made the more excited I became. Also, it felt almost like one of those things that I classify as things that you don't know that you know - it's as though seeing it or hearing it brings it to the conscious mind. I was sitting there saying, Yes. Exactly. Of course. I knew this was very meaningful and going to be extremely useful to a lot of people. I was eager to share it with Bill C because I knew he would get it and really appreciate it."
"0882"	"(2004-07-12)"	"I was one of the women competing in the TV program Who Wants To Marry My Dad. The entire scenario was very different in the dream than it is on the actual TV program. For one thing, there were many more people around, or involved, of all ages, including children. The Dad was going to be making the decision himself. I was one of the finalists and from the things he had said to me I was pretty sure I was going to be the one he picked. We had gone somewhere with the intention of getting married in secret before the show was even over. Instead, we ended up putting the wedding ring on my hand and posing for a picture with the ring on my finger as the focal point of the picture but then returning to the house and the rest of the group and keeping what we did a secret. I was acting the way some people do when they have a secret that they know will be revealed soon."
"0883"	"(2004-07-15)"	"I was walking down a very windy street along the edge, like where the street would drain into the sewer. There was a lot of water flowing along there. I think I was walking towards my house on Lakeland Dr. I don't think the water was from rain. It seems to me that it was from something else. I also had a gallon of milk in my hand. I had poured a little of the milk in this water to make it flow faster. As I walking, I was walking right in the water. I was barefoot. I kept finding pennies. I was bending over to pick them up. I had too many in my hands so sometimes when I would try to pick them up I would drop another one. The water was moving so hard that I was afraid it would wash some of the pennies away before I had a chance to pick them up. So some of them I would stand on until I could pick them up. Once I had put them in my other hand I could pick new ones up without dropping them. Sometimes I would find 2, 3, or 5 all in one place. Someone I knew, or someone walked up and wondered what I was doing. I guess I was kind of in their way. But then they went ahead and walked around me. There was a woman with a young boy. I just smiled at her and kept picking up the pennies. There was also something about me having a little girl with me. She was completely naked. She was maybe somewhere between six and eight years old. There's something about her being upset about something and I was trying to cover her with a beach towel. I knew she wouldn't be upset if I covered her with the beach towel. At first she was getting very hyper, so I just barely got her covered with it, but it was in a very haphazard fashion. After she calmed down I was able to wrap it around her in a better fashion, so it would stay in place."
"0884"	"(2004-07-17)"	"I was with the husband of one of my CRHP sisters. His name was Arty, though I don't know that this is true in waking life. I was embarrassed by the fact that I knew it was one of their husband's but I didn't know whose and I didn't want him to know that or found out. We were in his car, or maybe a truck. I must have said something that he interpreted as flirting, because he seemed to jump on it and took it very seriously - hitting on me right away. He started talking about their marriage problems. He said they had been working on them. He was telling me that one morning, out of the blue, while he was lying in bed and she was in the bathroom getting ready for the day, he had told her that he was a happily married man. They had not been having a conversation or anything. Her response was, Well, Arty, Arty, happily married man. How about you get up and start helping me. The rest of the sentence was something about what needed to be done in the house or for the family. He was very hurt and discouraged by that. We must not have been driving at the time because he leaned way over in front of me. I admit was somewhat attracted, but I'm not sure if it was the attention that was attracting me or the man himself. As he leaned over I reached up and rubbed his shoulders in an effort to show my support or provide emotional comfort. I found myself lightly breathing on the back of his neck and turning away immediately because I didn't want to encourage his interest in me. His interest seemed to be fueled by a difference in personalities between his wife and myself. He turned around so his back and head were lying in my lap. He had very short, reddish-blond hair. His face appeared to have something similar to freckles but not obviously so the way freckles normally look. He looked young and was a nice-looking man, but not strikingly so. He didn't have the type of physical appearance that I would notice on the street and say, He's an attractive man. He was physically fit. At first I thought his wife was Judy D. but then I decided it must be Karen E. I was trying hard to figure out a way to find out for future but didn't want to ask him because I knew that would be bad and possibly hurt his feelings as well. I think that he knew there was a mutual attraction so I finally told him that I could not get involved with him. Now we're at their house and they have three, maybe four sons. A couple of them are getting ready to go for a bike ride. One or two of the boys seem to be teenagers or close to it. One seems to be very young, maybe seven or eight. The other seems to be in between them. The youngest one is on an adult size bike, much too big for him, and is going too fast for his taste. The middle son gets on the back of that bike with him and gets it going much faster. He was telling him that he had to do this for some reason. It seemed to be related to developing skill in bike riding. They started down a hill and lost control of the speed. Before long they fell off the bike and started rolling headfirst down the hill. Amazingly they were neither one hurt, and I don't recall them wearing helmets or anything. We are back at the house and I am either noticing the problems between Karen E and Arty. I think the three of us talked about them needing to work out their problems. They didn't even want to be in the same room as each other. It was right after Easter because there were a number of Easter baskets with candy in them. There was one for each of the boys, one each for Karen E and Arty, and then there were three large family baskets and some candy sitting along side them still in the store wrapping. They asked me to put the baskets somewhere. I was going to put each of the boys baskets in their rooms and but they said no to that. But they also didn't want the family baskets somewhere where Karen E and Arty would have to see each other to get a piece of candy. I was taking some of the candy that was still in the store wrapping out of that wrapping and putting it in the baskets. Arty said he wanted a Peep and someone else said they were all gone. I started digging through the baskets and found several. I took one but don't remember him coming to get one. I was trying to arrange the rest of the candy and put all like candy together, so they would easily know what was in each basket. There was some special kind of candy in a long, narrow square, yellow box. It was something that I really liked and just for a second I thought about hiding it or keeping it for myself but I didn't even take one. It didn't seem that Karen E and Arty were going to be able to work things out, because Karen E didn't seem to want to. I still was not going to get involved because Karen E was my CRHP sister."
"0885"	"(2004-07-19)"	"I have this visual of something that has different colored sections to it, various geometric shapes, and each has a black number on it. Whatever this thing was it was about the size of a typical jigsaw puzzle but it seemed to be part of a wall or hanging on a wall. A man has taken what I think is tissue paper like you would use in gift wrapping and laid it flat in each of these sections, matching the colors. The one that stands out in my mind is a green rectangle in the upper - middle section. It seems to be one of the more important ones. The point was to try to get people to do what they were supposed to do with each section. The man who put the tissue paper on it did it as much for himself as for the other people. Each section seemed to require some different type of action. He and I discussed the actions and it seems that I had either recommended he do the tissue paper thing or told him that I thought it was a good idea after he did it."

"0887"	"(2004-07-24)"	"I was in an office that was a big, open space where a lot of people worked in the one open big open area. I was standing along a half wall. It was maybe only 3 or 4 feet high. Something happened and everything started moving. It wasn't like an earthquake or falling over or up or down or anything like that. It was more like the room was motorized to turn clockwise or counter-clockwise. Although it was moving towards me and I realized that I had no where to go - that I was going to be crushed. As everything started moving towards me and pushing me over I also got pushed back far enough and up a little bit so that I somehow, miraculously, didn't get crushed. I was in another room and something was causing me to go around the room in a circular pattern, to just keep going around the room. I had my one arm extended out and downward. It was like I was letting my hand brush things as I was moving around in this circle. It was almost as though something else was propelling me around in this circle. As my hand would hit things, sometimes it would brush people in the back of the head. One time it broke some glass things. Then this man, one of the employers or managers was saying that he hated glass. He liked that I was breaking this glass as I was moving around. There was a woman who might have been an office manager. She was telling all of the other people that they had to put all of their things away that were made out of glass. Like if they had decorative personal items sitting out that were made out of glass. She had a really tall one. It was a couple feet tall but it was sitting on a desktop. It might have been crystal. Part of it was frosted and it was actually two pieces. She took the top piece off. It had an angel on it. Now I was down as though I had been sitting on the floor. I saw that underneath the angel was a dove. Now I'm up moving around again and I'm moving through a different area. There are a lot of different kind of wind chimes, or things that look like wind chimes, hanging all over the place. It doesn't look like a room. It looks like the kind of scene movies create to depict heaven. It's very white and ethereal, with no end in site. I think I must be indoors because all of these things are hanging from somewhere, yet I see no ceiling that they could be hanging from. These things are all different sizes, lengths, shapes, and colors. They are all very beautiful. They make the most beautiful sounds. I'm reaching up and running my hands through them so I can hear the beautiful sounds they make. Some of them I move around in a circle a little bit. I move my body around in a circle as I gaze up at them because they are so beautiful. I'm talking to someone about how beautiful they are and how beautiful they sound. Then I'm getting ready to move into another area. I see a doorway now, but still none of this looks like a room. As I approach this doorway a man walks up to my right side. I turn to look to see who it is and see that it's Wes S. His eyes open very wide and he smiles at me. I say, Wes S! First he takes my right hand in both of his, like a warm greeting. Then he holds my right hand with his right hand and he puts his left hand on my back. He starts taking one finger and rubbing my back and yet kind of poking my back as well. It hurt. I kept saying, stop. That hurts. Stop. Stop. That hurts."

I realized that it was time for an oil change and so I made sure to get that done before I went there. I knew he would ask me and I didn't want to tell him that I was past due on it. We were talking about something else and I told him that I had fixed it myself. It was something under the hood where I had used an Allen wrench. It was a large round thing with a kind of a plate to cover the top, almost like the carburetor and the cover on the carburetor. You used an Allen wrench to take the thing off that held the cover on. We were talking about it making a little bit of a noise and that I hadn't quite fixed that. We lifted the house and I used the Allen wrench to take this thing back off to show them what I did. There was also a silver metal piece that was maybe 3-4 inches long and an inch or less wide. It wasn't all flat. Maybe a quarter inch of it was flat, then there was a slight bend and then the other end of it also had a slight bend in the other direction for about an inch of it. Somehow the one end of it had a hole in it that fit over the bolt or whatever. The other end slipped under this thing. The cover went on top. They thought that maybe I had put that piece in wrong, or in the wrong place. He agreed that I had done it right so I put it all back together, used the Allen wrench to tighten in back up. As I tightened it up, it kind of pulled something up, like it was supposed to. I started the car and it was still making a noise so I loosened it a little bit. As I did the sound stopped. It was a case where it had to be tight but not too tight. If it were too loose it would make a noise and if it were too tight it would make noise."

I was telling someone that after I finished it I was going to take a sander and sand off the tops of the vertical ones and then put some polyurethane on them so they wouldn't be rough - so the children wouldn't get scraped or scratched or cut or snag their clothes. Then I started wondering if the horizontal pieces of bamboo were going to be slick enough. It seems that I did something, but I don't think I put polyurethane on those. It seems that I was going to put something else on those so it would be slick like a slide. It seems to me that an adult tested it for me. They did slide down but it was very slowly and they got stuck at a couple of places. It wouldn't be much fun for a child to slide down that slow. I was thinking about what else I would put on top of it to make it slick so a child could have fun sliding down."
"0891"	"(2004-07-26)"	"I sending out a mass emailing to a list that we bought. The email was about the DOP free teleseminar. I don't know of the email actually went out or if I was concerned that it was going to go out before I talked to Jeff K, or maybe it went out and the responses were mostly unsubscribes. I think there was some concern about what we would do if we had too many people register since the call can only handle 150 participants. I was thinking that I needed to call Jeff K before it actually went out to make sure that he and I were both clear on everything and that I understood everything well before it went. I also wanted to make sure that I took time to think through it all well before I told him to go ahead."
"0892"	"(2004-07-27)"	"I was in a car with five other people. I was in the back seat next to the right window. There were three people in the front seat. The person in the middle was Doug Wilson, the designer from Trading Spaces. He and I were having a discussion. I leaned forward and caressed his right check and slightly down his neck with the back of my left forefinger. We were talking about who would be designing my room. I said I had mixed feelings because I wanted to work with him but I also wanted him to design my room because the woman that was going to be doing my room started out as an assistant to Frank Bielec. I like Frank's fine, but they are often not my style. Doug's are more often my style. We stopped by a store to get something. There were members of my family there. Bob F and Rachel S were there. I'm mostly with Rachel S and I was going to buy here some candy. I asked her what she wanted and she said M & M's. Someone commented that she always gets the very same thing, that she always gets M & M's. We're rushing because we have to hurry to get back to the house. Several people went in to the store to get sweets, candy. Bob F walks by me on his way back out to the car. He had cotton candy. He said it was for everyone to share. I thought that was cool because I hadn't had cotton candy in a long time. We're back at the houses. I was in the neighbor's house that we were trading spaces with. The woman of the house reminds me of a TV actor, I can't think of her name or the name of the program she was in now. I think her name is/was Cathy [unknown in waking life] . She has blonde, shoulder-length hair, about my age or a bit older. I went over to their house. I'm walking up a stairway to get to where I thought the room was that we were going to redecorate. The staircase was very unusual. I went up a half dozen or so steps and then it went to the right - flat, and then it went up and to the left for a few more steps and then in a different direction and so on. It had a very sturdy wood banister, medium color wood. I was thinking that it was very cool, that these were the kind of features that I would like to find when I buy a house - something very unique and different yet very classy and elegant. When I got to the top of those stairs I thought I would be at the room that I was going to decorate but I realized that I wasn't, that I had to go up more stairs yet. This one is a very narrow spiral staircase. I can hardly fit on it. I was feeling very claustrophobic and uncomfortable. I was very glad to get to the top of it and step off into a large open space. I notice that this is a round space. Around the perimeter is a series of doorways but none of them have doors on them. There is also at least one sitting area that has a sofa, maybe another sofa or loveseat, lamp, and coffee table. I start walking toward one of the doorways. I'm not wearing a blouse or a bra. I'm trying to cover myself with my arms while I'm looking for Cathy, the homeowner. I was going to ask her if I could borrow a T-shirt. As I neared one of the doors I saw an older, heavyset woman with grey hair and glasses, sitting with her back to me, watching TV. I was embarrassed when I saw her turn around because I was naked from the waist up. I could tell by the look on her face she was thinking something but she didn't say anything. Just then Cathy walked out and I asked her if I could borrow a T-shirt. The whole time I'm thinking this is really odd for me to be naked from the waist up and why couldn't I have at least kept on what I was wearing until I got something else. I told Cathy that I had forgotten to pack a T-shirt or old shirt to work in during Trading Spaces. She said if I got paint on what she loans me I could just keep it. At first it seemed that she was going to have trouble coming up with a shirt that she was comfortable letting me borrow and get paint on. She did finally find one. I could a little bit into each room around the perimeter from where I was standing. They all looked like very large conference rooms. Cathy brought me a T-shirt that reminds me of my SAID T-shirt. As I got ready to leave I was now with a couple of women. I got to the top of the spiral staircase to go back down. I turned sideways to go down because it was so narrow. As soon as I started down I started feeling so claustrophobic and uneasy because it was such a tight fit that I stepped back off the stairway and said, I have got to find a different way down. I just cannot go down those steps again. Later I was having a conversation with the woman who was going to be the designer in my room in my house. I think I was starting to feel a little more comfortable with what she might do in there."
"0893"	"(2004-07-28)"	"I was at Jennifer K's family's home. Her whole family was there, her parents, husband, children, brother and his family. I actually think I had spent the night there because I was going to go to Kings Island with them the next day. We got up and his parents had slept downstairs on some makeshift beds. I was getting dressed. I had black shorts and my salmon knit top. I questioned my choice of what I was going to wear that day but then decided that was very appropriate for the rides and such. I was helping fold blankets and such. There was one blanket that was, it reminded me of faux leather except that one side was very shiny red with a bit of a pattern to it and the other side was very soft. The whole thing was very thin, very lightweight. As I got ready to fold it Jennifer K walked up and said, let me show you how to do this one. She folded it so the leather side was towards the inside. She said, now you just wet this a little bit and it will stick together. Then it was also very smooth, with no wrinkles. It was also very small now that she folded it, even though she only folded it once. It was probably less than 12 x 12 inches. We were talking about various things when Jennifer K began talking about being a spiritual director. She was asking me some questions. Some of her family were there now. Rather than giving her direct answers I started asking her a few questions. I said something like, would you be able to not teach? Would you be able to not judge or be critical? She said she didn't think that was as problem. I said something to her about people in business, with business situations or decisions. I said something about the fact that she doesn't have much business experience, management experience. She was silent for a minute but then said she did. I said, Oh. Well. I guess then that wouldn't be a problem. But I've known Jennifer K for nearly 20 years and know that she doesn't have that business experience. I was thinking about that and thinking, I've known her for so long and I can't recall her getting this type of experience. But I didn't question it any further. It was a pretty serious conversation, not lighthearted and laughing as is typical for us. I don't know what time we were going to leave to go to Kings Island and don't know if we ever even discussed it. So as everyone was getting ready I just took off for a little while. I don't know if I was going to run errands or what my intention was. I went to NTNS, but in the dream in looked different. There was a glass door on the side of the store for customer use and there were a lot of glass windows on the side of the building as well as the front. I pulled into an angled parking space right in front of that side door. As I parked there seemed to be a dip in the parking space because my car rolled forward a bit after I had put it in park. It scared me for a second because I was afraid it was going to roll into the glass door. I put the car in gear and backed up enough so when I turned the engine off and put it in park again it would not roll forward, and it didn't. I'm back at the house and I went inside quickly. I had my purse and a box of something that had fallen out of purse. I picked it up quickly and as I was trying to get in back in my purse I said something to Jennifer K. I said, I'm sorry. I needed to run some errands quickly but I forgot to ask you what time you were all planning on leaving. I heard someone say ten til six this evening. I thought, Oh. They're not going until this evening? I didn't think that I wanted to hang around there all day but I also wondered if I even wanted to go along if they were going that late in the day. We would only have a few hours there, and in the evening, and I wasn't sure how much fun I would have, and lots of other stuff was going through my head. Then someone else, maybe a couple of people, said things that gave me the impression that they were just kidding."
"0894"	"(2004-07-29)"	"I was with Ben D. We were laying in bed. We were kissing and cuddling. He said something about me always being the aggressor. I got very upset with him and said that was not at all true. So I just lay there and refused to do anything more than allow him to hold me, which felt very nice. I learned that he was ill, that he has cancer. When he realized that we weren't going to do anything more than cuddle, he told me about a machine that he uses in bed for his health. We had it brought into the bed so he could use it. I was talking to, I think his doctor. Ben D told me that he had known about this for sometime. I asked about the prognosis and he said that he thought he had maybe 3-4 years at most. Of course, I was very saddened by this."
"0895"	"(2004-07-31)"	"I belonged to a community of witches along with my husband and children and my husband's second wife. We had three children - twin baby boys and a girl that was a few years older than the babies. My husband was the man that plays Ray Barone in the TV program and his second wife was Debra, the woman that plays his wife on that program. The babies were ill and Debra and I were taking care of them. One of the babies was named Matthew. It was bedtime and I decided to take Matthew to bed with me. I knew it was something that is not recommended but I wanted to be able to watch him closely since he was ill. I lay on the left side of the bed and put Matthew to my right. I checked to make sure there would be plenty of room left for Ray. I lay there watching Matthew's labored breathing, knowing it was part of the illness but nothing life threatening as it was. Debra was in a separate bed but in the same room. She had put the other baby in his own bed. Ray came and got into bed with me. We talked for a minute or two about the babies. After Matthew fell asleep, I moved over next to Ray. We completely covered ourselves with a blanket. Debra was suspicious and got upset and told us to stop - because she was jealous. We didn't think she was justified in trying to tell us to stop, but we did anyway. I realized that Matthew had become entangled in the sheet and I panicked, desperately trying to get him untangled so he could breath freely. The sheets had put his body in a very uncomfortable, difficult position. I finally freed him and I could tell by his breathing that this had made his labored breathing even worse. Now I am with the daughter, Ray, and some other people. They are talking about their death names. I didn't know the daughter's death name but wanted to. They told me what I had to do to find out, but warned me that the timing should be right and that I had to be sure I wanted to do this as it could be dangerous. There was some benefit to knowing this but I can't remember now what it was. I decided the benefit was worth it - and that I could prevent anything bad from happening. We went to this place to find out her death name. There was a very large, round, wicker basket sitting on the floor. It reminds me of a laundry basket. It had lots of stuff in it, including a bunch of different types of children's hats. My daughter and I were supposed to select a hat for her and then go through some kind of process, which would end up letting us know what her death name was. We tried several different hats on her and finally decided on one. We began walking through this space. I know it was indoors but that's really all I can describe about it. At some point some people, other witches, stopped us to warn us that a bunch of bad witches had done something, cast a spell or something maybe, related to my daughter's hat. It was causing her to have many, many hats and we needed to get rid of all of them immediately or she would be in grave in danger. We took the hat off. As we did another one appeared. As we took it off another one appeared. This kept happening over and over again. We are trying frantically and rapidly trying to get every hat off. We knew we had to just keep at it until no other hats appeared."
"0896"	"(2004-08-01)"	"I was walking outdoors, I think along a road or railroad. I was quite depressed and upset about most everything in my life but began specifically thinking about my finances. I recalled a prayer that I had read once and tried to recite as much of it as I could recall. As I did so a very bright light appeared from behind. It was too bright for me to tell what its source was. Along with it was a very, very loud noise - I couldn't even hear myself. It seems that the earth began to shake as well. I became extremely frightened and panicked and started praying as though my life depended on it. I was asking God to protect me or to make whatever this was stop, but I also almost seemed at a loss for words for prayer - or maybe didn't even know what to pray for. I had a feeling that this light was from God. Maybe it was an affirmation of the prayer I was saying earlier about my finances."
"0897"	"(2004-08-01)"	"I was at an outdoor shopping center. A man from my older brother's high school class, Tom A, came up to me and was holding a square, styrofoam carry-out box. I was outside of my car and he walks up. He opens the driver's door and gets in and tells me that he's borrowing my car. At first he tells me to get so I go around to the passenger side. I'm very concerned and confused. I get in and he says, I'm going to borrow your car. Is that okay? I'm just sitting there dumb-founded because this whole situation is bizarre - seeing him and him wanting to borrow my car - and it isn't okay with me. He wanted the keys. I gave them to him so he could go ahead and start up the car. Then he says something about me waiting there or going along. I'm still not saying anything, still dumbfounded. I don't think I answered him yet so he starts driving. I finally ask him what he's doing. He said it's better if I don't know. He offers to stop and let me out. I refused to get out and let him take off with my car. I didn't know if he would bring it back or not. He gets ready to pull out onto the road from the shopping center parking lot. There is finally a small opening. I told him to punch it. He pulls out slowly. I say it again a couple of times. Punch it. Punch it. He said, They'll hear me. Then he does step on the gas hard and realizes that the car is very quite so no one heard that he stepped hard on the gas. He said something about how quiet the car is. As he pulls out I see a house to my right. They have a bunch of stuff out in the yard but it also looks like there is a dead body. I just see something wrapped, covered up with a white cloth. It looks like a dead body. I right away think, Omigosh. Did he have something to do with that? I think he's going to put the body in my car. I tell him that I do want to know what he's doing. He starts telling me but it's a long drawn out story."
"0898"	"(2004-08-05)"	"I was at the CAS office. Bill C had moved in to my office so the two of us were sharing it. His office was empty. I don't think Jane C was working there any longer. I have no idea why he did this - why we were sharing. We were both in there working and occasionally talking because there was no partition between us. His desk was towards the back of the office and mine closer to the door. Someone walked in and I saw them standing at the front counter, facing it. It was a very, very short black woman, maybe even less than 4 foot tall. I went out. As I approached her I asked her if I could help her. I couldn't get a clear look at her face. She didn't move. Because she was so short I was having more trouble seeing her face. I didn't really want to bend down and get right in front of her to see her face. I kept asking her if I could help her with something. She didn't move and she didn't answer. I finally did bend down in front of her so I could see her face. I then realized that it was the person we had hired to work part-time at the front desk. After I got right in front of her face she looked up a little bit and acknowledged me with her eyes. I think she finally did say something to me. I asked her where she had been because we had hired her and she had worked a couple of days and then she just didn't come in for a week. She didn't call or anything else and now here she is just showing up. I started explaining to her that we had let Bill Cro and Blair K go. I asked her about working at the front desk and it didn't seem that would be a problem for her. I said something again, asking her again where she had been, why she hadn't shown up or call for a week. She said something about her period. I said, You just didn't come in because of your period? She said, Well. It started on Sunday and I didn't have to be here until Thursday. But we had hired her to work Tuesday through Friday. I didn't get what she said, didn't understand it, and didn't agree with it. This had taken me so much by surprise that I wasn't sure how to react or what to say. I said, Well, with all of the changes here recently I'm not sure what we're going to need with this position, what we want to do. I asked her how she would feel about coming in three days a week instead of what we had initially agreed to. She said that was absolutely fine. She actually seemed to like the idea. I was wondering how she could afford to work so little. I asked her if she would be okay. She said, Oh yes. That's fine. I went back in to talk to Bill C about it. He was going through some old folders and stuff. He filled out an application or resume for Bryan N and asked me what it was doing in there. I told him I was organizing and go through stuff and found that by itself so I just put it in the resume folder. I was going to go back and file it somewhere else later. He was pulling miscellaneous stuff out. Some of it he was throwing away and some of it he was pulling out to have me or CeeCee [unknown in waking life] do something with. He was also talking to a woman with the last name O'Hare [unknown in waking life] . He wanted me to look it up in the computer but I couldn't find it. I was spelling it O'Hare. He was in the computer looking at the same time and he found it, just as I did. I finally found it without the apostrophe and with a hyphenated last name. I said something about it being a duplicate record. I said that we need to get better at preventing or eliminating duplicate records. We talked about that a little bit."
"0899"	"(2004-08-07)"	"I was getting on I-74 from St. Joe going towards my mother's hometown. I saw that the traffic was really backed up and moving very slowly. I went ahead and merged, thinking that there was no other way to get there."
"0900"	"(2004-08-09)"	"There is a couple living in the country with their one child. They have a very run down home, not much more than a little shack. I don't see any other homes around there. I think the family may be has both of the parents are drinking and maybe even doing drugs. Maybe it's just an alcohol issue. There is something going on in the town that they live in. there's been a string of murders. This couple's child is a boy that is in preteen years. He is very interested in trying to solve this murder on his own or by listening to the news in the town. It seems that there are various officials around their property. I'm not sure if they're looking for clues, or evidence, or other bodies or what the deal is. There is a commercial size van or some other similar kind of vehicle. No, it seems more like a small camper. The wife is standing at a window of whatever this is. You can see her from the waste up. She has on a white t-shirt. They're all very scraggly looking, unkempt, unclean. The man goes out and is talking to his wife through a window. She leans down and he reaches up and grabs the neck of her shirt and yanks it down and rips it to where it's below her breasts but you still can't see much of her breasts. She's yelling at him saying that she gave up such a nice life for him and this kind of thing. He went back inside. Now I'm part of the dream, sitting at their kitchen table. I ask him if he wants to have a peach Schnapps with me. He sits down at the table while I'm asking him and behind him is another small table that has maybe a dozen or so bottles of different kinds of liquor sitting on it. As he reaches around I wonder if there is even any Peach Schnapps there or if there is any left. He finds it and grabs it. It's a fairly small bottle and it's clear liquid. I don't know if Peach Schnapps is clear or not. He opens it and pours it for me, pouring a lot. I keep saying, Stop. Stop. But he pours about a 12oz glass full. I guess I was going to drink it straight. We started drinking it. Somebody said something to us. The man and his wife are now sitting in a vehicle. Now there's a third woman out there also. The wife is sitting down with her back to me. The man is sitting with his right side to me, facing to my right, not directly at me. The other woman is standing to the left of the wife and facing me. They're having a conversation about something. I notice that the wife is drinking something she isn't supposed to be drinking. She has it sitting on the floor and it has a huge straw in it. She's drinking it out of there. She doesn't realize that she's doing it. I know that if he saw her he would be really angry. Now she's not there anymore and there are little wisps of smoke coming out of the straw that she had been drinking out of. Three men pulled up in an ambulance or a fire truck. They were possibly undercover, trying to find this person that they were after. They were pretty sure the person was in the house but no one had ever seen this person before. They were trying to lure this person out. One of the three men lay down on the stretcher and the other two covered him up as though he was dead. The other two took him into the house, thinking that they would be able to lure the person out that they were looking for by getting him to identify this dead body. Not by acting suspicious of him at all, but somehow this would bring this other person out because he would want to identify the body. As soon as he came out they were going to nab him. Now it seems there were more people in the house as well. The fire truck left. After it pulled away I noticed a big hole in the ground. I went over and looked down. There was a body in there. I started screaming. I let out a blood-curdling scream. Someone came out and lifted this body out of the hole and laid it on the ground. As they laid it on the ground it moved. We realized then that he had been hiding there, just waiting for someone to find him. The body rolled over and kicked the thing off that had been covering him up so he would look like a dead body and people wouldn't be able to tell he was alive. He stood up and he had a gun. I fell over and was lying on the ground on my back. He held the gun to my face or to my chest. Obviously, I was terrified. Now there's another man with him who also has a gun. They are rounding up the family and these other people. They're taking them all inside. They just leave me lying there. The man who had been holding a gun to my chest looked to the side at me as he began to walk away and walk the other people inside. I lay there for a few seconds thinking how odd that was. I didn't know if that meant it was okay with them if I got away. I didn't know if I should try to get up and get away. I didn't even know where to run to because there were no other buildings or anything around. I finally decided to get up and try to get away. I started to my left and I saw a door. I went in thinking that maybe there would be a good place in there to hide. When I got inside there were a bunch of different doors. They were all closed. I was going into them one at a time trying to decide if it was a good place to hide. I would go into one find out it was a little bitty space not much bigger than a bathroom. Even though I could lock the door they could just shoot through the door and kill me. I just kept checking doors, looking for a place that I thought was safe for me to get away. The last one that I went into entered into a long hallway that went to the left at the end. There was another doorway there. I decided that was my best bet so I closed the door behind me, locked it and proceeded down the hallway."
"0901"	"(2004-08-11)"	"I had an appointment to visit with Doctor C, just to stop and say hello. When I went to see him we were sitting and chatting. He was being a bit of a jerk, as he can sometimes be. During the course of our chat I started asking him about something and he was just being a jerk. I got upset and just decided to leave. I got up to leave and I gave him a hug and my eyes were tearing. He saw that and apologized. One of us said we would just try again sometime. Sara C was there and also gave me a hug. As I turned to walk away she said, give us a kiss. I kind of mouthed a kiss at them and turned and left. I don't know if I'm observing or if I'm talking to someone about him. They were told there was a change in the schedule. They had to change all of the people who were scheduled for a particular day to the following Saturday. The person who had to make these calls was very upset about it. I think it might have been me talking to this person. I finally asked this person if they would want to know how I would handle it. They said yes. I said I would just move everyone to the same time that they were scheduled but on Saturday. So the person who was scheduled for 9:30 on the day they have to change, call and tell them what has happened and that you are rescheduling everyone, that you've given them the same timeslot and ask them if that will work for them. If they say no, then work at finding another slot for them."

I remembered that there was a purchase from Dale G that I had not found and changed to the new tracking method, and I wasn't sure if it would be found through the other methods that we were using to find and enter past product purchases."
"0903"	"(2004-08-22)"	"I was living in a very large, rustic home and had a teenage daughter. The woman from a one of the design shows, her name is Joan Stefan, but I can't remember the name of the show, was there to help us redecorate my daughter's room. She had brought another designer with her. It was Nadine G, from SAID. We had to leave while they did the room. When we came back one of my daughter's friends was with us as well. My daughter wasn't sure she liked the room. Her friend was kind of trying to sell her on it. I think her friend had been helping the decorators. The room was done in red and black velvet. She had a chandelier type light fixture. They had covered all of the arms of the chandelier in black velvet. The chandelier could easily be raised and lowered but I don't know if it was by something like a pulley or if it was electronically. They had other various black velvet accents in the room. The bedspread was red velvet. I liked it a lot - for her. The walls they had left the same as they were all a very natural, beautiful wood, as was the ceiling. It reminds me of the inside of a cabin. But it was much larger and it had very high vaulted ceilings. We began talking about redoing my room next. Nadine G was showing me some fabrics that were red and gold. I said that I had been thinking about red and black for myself, before they had used that in my daughter's room. Her and I neither one wanted our rooms to look so much alike. I suggested using cranberry or maroon. I said I love jewel tones. I asked my daughter if she thought that was different enough, if she would be okay with that as long as the designer made it look different enough. She said she would. I can't remember if she was also going to use some black accents in my room too. We either decided to use a different designer and/or we decided to change a few of the things in my daughter's room that she didn't like. So we began taking out the accessories that she didn't like. The designer said she would be taking those back. We wouldn't be paying for those then. She had taken monofilament and hung figurines from the ceiling all the way around the room. Along two adjoining walls she had hung a lot of them, only about six inches apart, on both of these walls, coming out from the corner. There were maybe a dozen on each wall. She had them attached them to the ceiling with gold or silver thumbtacks. We had a ladder that I was climbing up on to pull the thumbtacks out. Now there was a man there also, helping to clear these things out. The figurines were porcelain, or ceramic. We said something about how they were hung from the ceiling. The man had drilled holes through two sides of them to thread the monofilament through. He said when a designer wants something a certain way, he just has to figure out how to make it happen. I was moving the ladder along as I removed the thumbtacks and took the figurines down. As the ceiling got higher and higher I became a little more leery. I moved the ladder towards a higher point along the ceiling and when I went to step on the first step it toppled over. I didn't fall to the ground, but did fall off. I noticed then that one of the legs was broken just about 2 inches from the bottom. The bottom piece of the leg was either just partially still attached to the rest of the leg or it was crumbling. I can't tell for sure which. Someone said something about it being okay, that I shouldn't be climbing up that high anyway. I said I could only go so far even if I wanted to because I would get to a point where the ceiling would be too high and I wouldn't be able to reach it from even the top step of the ladder. Someone said the carpenter would have to come in and get those down. Some of the accessories used in redecorating the room belonged to my daughter. We were gathering those together in one place to make sure they didn't leave the room. There was a series of animals carved out of wood. I think they were all the same type of animal, maybe deer. But they were different sizes and in different stances. I see other things that we had moved as we began to clear out the things that we weren't going to keep. It almost looks like a 3-4 rectangle, 6-foot, fold-up tables. We had folded them up, I suppose, and put them in one corner of the room. My daughter had two low dressers in her room that also belonged to her."
"0904"	"(2004-08-24)"	"Heather Locklear was going to exercise with me. We were talking about the fact that neither of us really wanted to exercise, or felt like it, but we knew we needed to. We were going to use an exercise video. I was rewinding the tape from the last time we had used it. I was having trouble getting the last few minutes to rewind. The tape didn't look like they do in waking life. The tape itself was much wider, maybe 4 inches wide. There seemed to be a strip of paper wound with the videotape. The paper was just as wide as the tape and about as long as the amount of tape still to be rewound - maybe 10 minutes worth. There was printing on the paper. It reminds me of the strips that some stores hand you with your receipt that have coupons and advertisements on them. I reached in and started pulling that paper out, realizing that's what was causing the problem. I was talking to Heather about this. She didn't think that was the problem but I was sure that it was. Then there was something about emailing someone some web links. She had a lot of piercings on her face, both eyebrows, one or two on her nose, one or two around the mouth area - lips and tongue. I was thinking that was going to be a problem when people see that on the web, and wondered if she would remove them so I could change that on the web page before I forwarded that link."
"0905"	"(2004-08-24)"	"I had gone to the 11:00 a.m. Mass at my church. Unlike in waking life there were pews in the entry area. I was in one of those pews. It was fairly crowded. I had people on both sides of me in my pew as well as the pews in front of and behind me being fairly full. There was only one other pew in front of me. We were standing, although I don't think Mass had begun yet. The woman to my right appeared to be about the same age, height, and size as myself, with shoulder-length blonde hair. She was a scheduled Eucharistic Minister at this Mass. Another woman walked up in front of the first pew and began to talk to the blonde woman to see if they needed a substitute for someone who had not shown up to be a Eucharistic Minister. Since I, too, am an Eucharistic Minister, when the 2nd woman walked away I took this opportunity to ask the woman to my right how they normally do things at the 11:00 a.m. Mass. She was very rude to me and answered my question as though she thought I was asking if they needed a sub today. She said if they did need someone they would get so-and-so. If they needed another they would get so-and-so. I can't remember the names. I think she also said one other person. She was so rude in the way she said it, as if to say, We don't need you, with the emphasis on you. I wasn't so bothered that they didn't need me to serve, but I was very bothered by the way she spoke to me and that she did not hear nor answer my actual question. I turned and walked out of church, even though Mass had not even started yet. I was walking around outside thinking about what, if anything, to do about this. I thought I would talk to Scott S. I saw him outside but didn't want to talk to him at that time since I knew Mass would begin soon and he was getting ready for that. Then I saw Father Eric and the servers for that Mass, but did not want to discuss it with him as I saw no need to bother him with it - especially since scheduling of Eucharistic Ministers and communicating procedures is Scott's responsibility. I must have said something briefly to Scott anyway however, and that I would like to talk to him later, as Father Eric overheard and responded in a kind of flip manner. I was bothered by this - both what he said and the way he said it. After Mass I found Scott. As I approached him he said he was very busy. He lived a house a few hundred yards from the church. He was loading things into his car. I didn't know that the parish provided a home for the Director of Liturgy. I promised him that I would only take two minutes so he agreed to have me come into his house. As I was telling him what happened he was eating something. Then he began talking to me about his mother, who apparently lives with him. Their house was very cluttered and he was looking through the clutter, boxes on the floor and stuff piled on and around the boxes, as he talked. Apparently she was an obese woman and that was one of the things he talked about. As he was talking she came out of another room. He introduced her to me. She didn't say anything but simply went into another room. Scott and I are now on bicycles. We were talking about bike riding and he asked me where I was headed. I said I was on my way to my mother's hometown. He seemed surprised and impressed. I said it wasn't that big of a deal, as it is only 8 miles away. He said he still didn't think he could go that far. We start peddling our way up a small incline and I tell him that this is the hard part. He is standing on the pedals now to get more leverage to get up the incline. I tell him that I don't have the advantage of a bicycle that I can do that with and it makes it tougher to get up the incline when I stay seated. Now we are in the living room of Scott's house, again, but there are a bunch of other people there who are also Eucharistic Ministers for the 11:00 a.m. Mass. We are discussing what happened earlier. Apparently the blonde woman has a good friend there and together they kind of rule the roost at the 11:00 a.m. Mass. As a way to resolve the situation they ask each of those two women and myself to tell the group a little about themselves. I tell them that I've been a member of the parish for about 16 years. That I am a spiritual director and dream practitioner, and that I also work as an Executive for a company that does sales training with a spiritual basis - teaching sales people to sale from a place of high intent. After hearing about each of us they ask everyone to vote. Everyone has a piece of white cardboard, about 12 x 12, and they are writing the name of the person they are voting for on that cardboard. Each person is asked, one by one, to say whom they voted for. As they do this, some of them make a few comments first, and then hold up their board as they say the name. The first 3 or 4 all voted for me and stated why. Some of them said good things first about the other two women, which I appreciated. It is interesting to note that when each person stated that they voted for me they called me Anna. The three women, myself included, that were being voted on did not vote. The vote was pretty much unanimous. I asked permission to say something. I said the following. It was not my intention to make these women, or anyone else uncomfortable or to try to force them to allow me to be a Eucharistic Minister at this Mass. My only purpose in bringing this up was to prevent anyone else in our church from feeling the way I felt this morning after talking to a member of the parish. Since the change in our Mass schedule and the subsequent change in when I am scheduled to serve as a Eucharistic Minister, I only wanted to find out how the people who have been ministers at this Mass in the past normally do things. What I don't think I said but was thinking was that instead of having my question heard and answered, I felt that an assumption had been made as to what I was going to ask, and their assumption was answered instead of my question. I feel I was spoken to in a very rude manner, based on what I considered to be very rude behavior on their part. That behavior being a seeming intent to only include certain people as Eucharistic Ministers at this Mass. I then said that because I did not desire to make anyone uncomfortable I would not force my participation in the 11:00 a.m. Mass, as this vote would have happen. Nor would I, in the future, ask if they needed a sub at that Mass. I offered to be asked if they do need someone and see me in attendance. I thought that would be best for everyone and I did not mind that at all. I again reinstated that my intent in bringing up the issue was solely to prevent other people from feeling, while in our church, the way I had felt in our church that morning."
"0906"	"(2004-08-25)"	"I was working on edits of BCB. I was also doing something with other titles, and talking with Bill C."
"0907"	"(2004-08-26)"	"I was doing more computer work at the CAS office. Some of it was with SF, some not. Working out problems or issues."
"0908"	"(2004-08-27)"	"I was at the CAS office. There were a number of people congregating there. It seems that they were coming for a meeting we had requested. They were waiting in the reception area. As they waited a vendor was delivering a dozen or more boxes of various sizes but all fairly large. Five of the boxes were computer monitors and five were computers. I don't know what the others were. I realized that Bill C must have ordered the computers for the new program he is starting, that he was going to set up five computer stations in the training room. I grabbed two of the boxes and began to drag them into the training room to get them out of the way as it was getting very crowded in the reception area and there was hardly anywhere left for someone to stand or to sit more boxes. I was surprised at how light the boxes were, unlike typical computer equipment. In the lobby right outside our office Bill C had arranged to hang some sculpture-like pieces. They were long, strips of some type of gold metal. They had a slightly hammered look to them. They were various lengths but some approximately five feet in length. They were all about one and a half to two feet in width. While all this other stuff was going on, these sculptures began falling to the ground. When the first one fell I commented that I was glad I wasn't standing under it or I might have been injured. After a couple more fell, I made a similar comment about being glad that no one else was being injured. A man who was there for the meeting asked me if we were still having the meeting or when we were going to start. I would guess his age to be in his 60's, from his grey hair. He was about 6 feet tall and medium build. He was wearing a grey suit, very average looking. There was another man there. He was little if any taller than me, maybe in his mid to late 30's, with very dark hair, and relatively thin. He was wearing a suit, looking very polished. A young woman came in for the meeting who was apparently a co-worker of the younger man. She was taller than he was, attractive, and also relatively thin. She was wearing professional attire. The two of them began chatting briefly and I heard him say, Good Girl. I turned and laughingly said, Good Girl? I was commenting on the chauvinistic sound of his comment. He said something to me about my questioning that. I'm not sure if he was being defensive, if he thought I was being too sensitive, or if he was just responding to me - but his response was at least presented in a light-hearted manner."
"0909"	"(2004-08-29)"	"Working in SF again, but this time it seems that I have the access personally and am using it for home purposes. Though it is something other members of my family need or are or will be using. There were a number of us living with my parents. Myself, BJ, Jody S and Jason S. BJ began talking openly about dating Bob W. It seems that someone had told her about my memory of him so she had been hesitant to talk to me about it. I finally found out that after only two months they had gotten married and not told anyone, or at least not many people. When I found out my first reaction was concern. Concern because they had married after only two months, especially given that her first husband turned out to be a child molester. I think she finally told us because she was now going to be moving out to live with him. Something changed in my life and I was going to be moving out also. I wondered if Jody S and Jason S were going to stay or if they would now feel that they should move out as well. Some of us had driven somewhere. We knew that Daddy really wanted to see the ocean one time in his life. We thought we were going to be close enough to the ocean that he would be able to see it but it didn't work out that way. Later he and Aunt A had gone with a salesperson to look at a home or a car. They got lost trying to find what they were looking for. They drove someplace that took them to the edge of a cliff. In fact they came dangerously close to driving off the edge of the cliff. The strange thing is that they didn't even realize it. When they returned home and were telling us about it we realized how close they were to the ocean and that if they had known Daddy would have been able to see it. While they were gone I was at home with Mother. I'm not sure what I was doing. I realized that I had broken the fingernail on my left thumb way down low, about a quarter inch from the bottom of the nail. I knew how painful it was going to be when it came off. I went to Mother to see if she had any suggestions on what to do. She started talking about using a fake nail. I said I hadn't used any of those since I was a young woman. She reached over and pulled my natural nail off. As I saw her reach for it and realized what she was going to do I panicked at the thought of the pain. I was quickly relieved and pleasantly surprised when it just lifted off and didn't hurt at all. In fact, the bottom part of the nail came off as well. There was nothing left of the nail. I even touch the pad of my finger where the nail used to be and was surprised by how it felt. It was smooth, didn't hurt at all, and it looked very smooth and almost shiny. She handed me a fake nail for it. We talked for a couple minutes about fake nails. The one she handed me didn't fit well. I knew I was going to have to trim it to make it fit. I don't know how I was going to attach it though. I started thinking about how nice my nails used to look when I wore these and it might be nice to have my nails look like that again. Although, I really didn't want to go back to fake nails, I like having my nails be my own."
"0910"	"(2004-08-29)"	"I saw a redecorating TV program quite a few months ago where the man was upset when he came home and saw what they did. This dream was like a follow up to that. It seemed that I changed back and forth in the dream between being myself and being his wife - who had invited the decorator in to do the work while her husband was away. When I was myself in the dream I was trying to get the man to not be angry with his wife. The dream became very sexual in nature."
"0911"	"(2004-08-30)"	"I was at a business that seemed like a bank or a post office. I was one of many customers there. I see at least five different areas where customers are being served. Each area has 3-4 different employees taking care of the customers at dark wood counters that are about 3-4 foot tall. Each employee has their own work station or work area. In the area where I am I have been in line there are 3 lines of customers and in between two of the lines there is a place that some customers can come up to and get taken care of before the rest of us. I some how know I am not supposed to be in that line but I get frustrated when someone walks up to that line and gets taken care of before me. She wasn't supposed to be in that line either but the employee just goes ahead and takes care of her anyway. As I'm standing there I realize that I should check on the progress of Bill C's book - to see if the next draft is ready for me to edit. Now I have a copy of the pages in my hand and I'm flipping through them wondering if they are all there. I check the last page number and think that they should all be there. I tap them on the counter to make sure they are all neatly together and then I hold them up to a bound, current edition to compare the size. The stack of new pages seems to be about the same size as the old edition. For a moment I wonder if it should be more - if Bill C should have written more. Then I realize it is just fine as it is. Now it feels as though I am at a hospital, because a doctor comes out and announces that he has some tickets to a football game that he is not going to be able to use and is willing to give them away to someone. He can't use them because a patient's care is going to have him working. He is a young doctor, maybe in his early 30's at most, tall with light brown hair. I don't ask for the tickets because I know I wouldn't appreciate them as someone else would. The game is between the Colts and the Bengals. A little while later another doctor comes out. This doctor is not much taller than I am, about my age, with dark brown hair and glasses. He's wearing dark rose-colored scrubs. He, too, has a pair of tickets to give away. These belong to a patient who will not be able to use them. The doctor is being very jovial. He is saying that whoever takes the tickets must also pretend to be this patient and assume his illness as well. I am now sitting at a table. There is a woman about my age, blonde hair and fairly small build, sitting to my left. She says something to me about the tickets. I say that it might be kind of fun for me because I grew up in Cleveland. I quickly correct myself and say, Well, just outside of Cleveland. Still, because I never go to football games, I knew I wouldn't enjoy it that much and didn't feel right taking the tickets to give them to Matthew, my dad, or my brothers. I was leaning back in this chair, not sitting straight in the chair at all, and reading a book. I just glance up from my reading every now and then to look at or listen to the doctor or to the woman to my left."
"0912"	"(2004-08-31)"	"I was working on the computer, both for CAS and for myself. For CAS I was working on Salesforce again."
"0913"	"(2004-09-01)"	"I was doing computer work for CAS but it wasn't on SF this time. I was particularly working in Excel and had my project management sheets open and Jennifer C's task list open."
"0914"	"(2004-09-04)"	"This dream has an interesting mix of characters. I am working at CAS, where we have a very large stockroom unlike in waking life. It reminds me of the stockrooms at the old People's Drug stores. The shelving is similar, made up of 2x4 corner posts and sheets of bare lumber for the shelving. The walking space between the shelves are approximately 5 feet in width and the width of the shelves are about 3 feet each. Except for the units along the walls two sets of shelves are placed back to back throughout the stockroom. The room has a very high ceiling. Most of the shelving units go almost all the way to the ceiling. One section of shelving in a corner is much lower than the others; much, much wider; and sturdy enough to be able to walk on it. It is low enough for a person to be able to climb to the top shelf and walk on it. I was in the stockroom going through products, but I don't know why. I noticed that some of the products were not shelved properly. I think I was looking at the various formats of BCB, though even this is different than in waking life. The product covers were all a very dark color. One of the products was in a three ring binder that was about 6 x 9 in size and was not shrink-wrapped. In this pile of binders were also some CD's and some booklets the size of the Tips booklet. The booklets were this same dark color. The binders were also stacked so they would have a tendency to fall, with the binding not be alternated every other one as you would need to stack them to prevent them from falling. I was standing there trying to put these things back where they belonged and straighten out the binders. As I was doing this I either realized that Bill C was back there or that he had come back while I was back there working. I heard something that told me he was rearranging the various things we had stored back there. It's something I had wanted to do but because it was going to be such a major project I couldn't do it alone and he had been postponing helping or getting me help to do it. I came out from between the shelving units where I was working to find out what was going on. Angie D from FCP was there as was Doug W and Ty P from the TV program Trading Spaces. I think a couple of the people there worked for Angie D. I immediately started helping them because I wanted to have a say in where things went. Currently some of the things that we rarely if ever used were stored on the shelves closest to the door and easiest to get to, while things that we use frequently were stored in the back. Some of the shelves had packing and shipping supplies like boxes. One of the shelving units near the door had Christmas decorations. On the one low shelving unit we had stored other Christmas decorations, mostly trees. I wanted to move these to a back location but also put all of the Christmas decorations together. I volunteered to climb up to the top walkable shelf and hand things down. I was talking as I climbed up there. There were numerous trees of various shapes and sizes. Some of them were fully decorated. I took the largest one and kind of dropped it into the waiting hands of 2 or 3 people. I think Angie D and Ty were two of the people who caught it. We thought we were done up there and then I spotted a couple of very small things, and told them to hold on while I got them. As I went back to get them, there was now more stuff up there, like a chest of drawers. On and around this furniture were various types of children's items. Some looked liked they were possibly toys, but there was also a small tabletop lamp and several things that seem to be nightlights. This part is either odd or sketchy. I wanted to make sure we didn't miss anything. Several times I said something like, Hold on. Here's another. Or Hold on. One more thing. There seemed to be numerous electrical outlets up there and each one had one of these nightlights in it. I was getting all of those to hand down to the people who were waiting on the floor to take things from me. But then there were also a couple of things, like on the top of the chest of drawers. On top of the chest of drawers were two items. One of them had a front piece that could be removed. I took just that part of that one item and left the rest of that item along with whatever else was sitting on top of that. Now it seems that there is someone else up there as well, helping me to collect these things. After I was back down on the floor I walked over to another shelving unit where someone was stacking something that had just been moved over there. She was standing and working right at the aisle end of that unit. There was only enough room for her to stand between the unit she was facing and the one behind her back. I said something about how close together they were. I said that wouldn't work. I tried and couldn't even fit between them. I was thinking it would be a hassle to correct it as we would have to remove everything that had already been placed there, move it, and then put everything back. One of the men came up, I think it might have been Ty, grabbed one of the corner posts and just pulled it across the floor to where it should be, allowing proper walking space between the shelving units."
"0915"	"(2004-09-05)"	"I was at a restaurant on a blind date that I had agreed to meet through a dating service. It wasn't a bad date but it wasn't a great one either. Later, I don't know if it was the same day or a different day, I was at the same restaurant meeting another man through the dating service. After he and I met we agreed to get together again the next day. He left and I stayed. I had decided to do some schoolwork there at the restaurant before I went home. I stayed for quite awhile, so long so that I became very sleepy. I decided to just rest my head against the half-wall along the booth I was sitting in. I was going to nap for a few minutes before driving home so I wouldn't fall asleep while driving. I ended up sleeping there the entire night. I had curled my legs up on the bench and covered myself with a coat. In the morning I woke up just enough to start thinking about where I was and what was going on around me. I saw a man walk towards me, he looked at me kind of odd, and then walked on by. He came back and again and said, Anna F? It was the second man I had met the day before that I had agreed to meet again today. That really woke me up. I said yes as I sat up and ran my fingers through my hair, and lightly rubbed my face around my eyes. I apologized and told him what had obviously happened. He didn't seem to mind, but offered no reassurance so I wouldn't be so self-conscious about my appearance. He sat down in the booth across from me. Two friends of his came in and sat down with us. He was talking primarily to them. I said something to them about my falling asleep there and being self-conscious about my appearance that morning. Their reaction was the same. It didn't seem to bother them but they also offered no reassurance. I was noticing the hair of the man I was there to meet. It was very curly, reminded me of a late 70's or early 80's style for me. I didn't think it was that becoming on him but certainly didn't want to let that keep me from dating a good man. He got up and left the table and came back. When he came back his hair was now straight and shiny. At first I questioned it in my own mind, thinking, Didn't he have curly hair a few minutes ago? I don't think I said anything to him."
"0916"	"(2004-09-05)"	"It was my first day back to work after my vacation. I went into the training room to sit down and talk with Bill C, as we typically do when we get together to discuss business. I sat down at one of the tables. I think I had two of my new business brochures lying in front of me, but not together. One was lying on the table with my appointment book on top of it. The other was lying on my notebook. Bill C was standing to my left. He might have been getting water. As I sat down I asked him if he missed me while I was gone. He didn't answer me. After what felt to me like an awkward silence I said that it seemed that Jennifer C had done well in my absence. At that point as he turned around to look at me he said something about having Penny [unknown in waking life] cut me twelve checks. I quickly turned my head to look at him. He was dead serious. Not a smile on his face. I was sitting there in shock. One of my worst fears had been realized. He had decided to terminate me. I quickly calculated in my head that he was giving me six months severance pay. Then, I don't know if I was wondering if he really meant twelve checks or if he actually meant twelve weeks pay - which would only be half as much and give me much more serious concern. Or he might have been saying something to clarify that."
"0917"	"(2004-09-12)"	"I was living in an apartment building that had several floors with several apartments on each floor. I met a young man living in the community who expressed a romantic interest in me. While I was surprised and hesitant, I was also trying to remain open. It seems that he has always been interested in older women. There were a few kisses and holding hands, but that is all there was to it. We had good conversations and there certainly seemed to be a good mental connection. There were numerous times that we went for walks around the neighborhood. He introduced me to another woman, I think it was his mom. She seemed to be around my age, much thinner than me, with shoulder length platinum-blonde hair. She seemed kind of cool towards me. Each time I met and talked with her it seemed to get better however. He was very affirming of me, in little and various ways letting me know that his affection for me was sincere and not sexual. That made me feel very good. In spending time with this man I began to meet quite a few of the other residents in the neighborhood. One time we were sitting with several of them and I made mention of this fact. Someone mentioned an elderly gentleman that lived in my building. There seemed to be a shared opinion that there was something bothersome about him - like something that he does regularly bothers people. I don't know what it was. Initially I agreed with it but quickly realized this was unfair and possibly even unfounded. He was going to be moving into another building and the other people in the building were kind of joking around that they were glad he was moving and now he would be someone else's problem. I thought this was kind of mean and inappropriate talk and it made me feel bad."
"0918"	"(2004-09-14)"	"I was at Mass with some of my siblings and Matthew. As people began standing and walking up to receive communion I saw Larry K. I was surprised because I didn't know he was Catholic. My family and I rose and began walking up, exiting the pew to our right. Matthew had been sitting to my right. As we moved out of the pew, Matthew stayed in front of me instead of minding his manners, stepping back, and allowing me to walk in front of him. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and looked at me. He immediately realized what he had done so he stepped to the side for me to get in front of him. He seemed a bit younger, and very thin. He was wearing very faded blue jeans and a light blue, short sleeved shirt."
"0919"	"(2004-09-15)"	"I was doing computer editing, creating and checking web links to other sites. It seems that it's a page, kind of a table of contents for a publication. This page has two entries from each section of the magazine and I think this page is just two issues. I'm working on it because I just recently discovered that there was a problem with them. There is another person involved in this, but somehow indirectly. There is some kind of physical implication for this other person, something that requires much effort for that person. It's as though I hear someone telling him, Come on. You can do this. I know it's hard, but you can overcome this. Look. Look. You're doing it."
"0920"	"(2004-09-16)"	"There were two groups of people competing in a business challenge. The challenge was to see who could sell the most of a netting fabric they had been given. The netting is the type of thing that would be used for bride's veil, or that used to be used on women's hats. The one team came up with two ways of selling it. Though the only way I can remember is that they were selling it to stores that sold women's hats, with suggestions on different ways to add it to the hats. The other team only came up with one way of selling it. I don't remember what that way was but I kept thinking that it was for women's hats - that they should be trying to sell it that way. Mostly I felt that I was an observer, though I felt anxious for the one team. "
"0921"	"(2004-09-18)"	"I think it was some kind of research group who wanted people's ears. Somehow ears were being used for the good of some other people. They wanted to take them from people who were still living. I was extremely upset by this and passionately trying to get them to understand what they were doing to these people's lives by doing this, what they were doing to their senses of self, their self-esteem. I wanted them to think about how differently they will be treated by so many people, if it is noticed that one or both of their ears was sliced off. They were just slicing the ear off even with the side of the head, so there would be no protrusion left at all. I found myself doing this on what I would describe as a cadaver, but I have no image of a face or even of the rest of a body. Now I'm discussing with someone the use of a hacksaw to cut off the top part of computer tower case. I was concerned that the hacksaw he had was too delicate to be used on something as solid as a computer tower case. I thought it would work but I also thought it would be damaged as a result of that use. He went ahead and used it. There was a ridge in the design of the case, about two/thirds way up. This is where he made the cut. I was somewhere totally different now, with different people. I was told that I had to use a hole dug in the ground outside as a toilet. There was a woman that I knew, maybe Jennifer K, that I was discussing this with - how unpleasant it was. She seemed even more surprised than I at this whole situation. As we talked, I picked up a roll of toilet paper, unrolled a fairly long piece and began to somewhat fold it up to use it. I was using a lot more than I would in waking life and didn't fold it neatly as I would in waking life. The person I was talking to turned away to give me at least a little privacy as I used this toilet. We continued to talk as I finished."
"0922"	"(2004-09-20)"	"I had just taken a new job as a bellman at a hotel. The person who was training me was a young black man named Michael [unknown in waking life] . I had completed my training but had not helped a guest by myself yet, or even with anyone watching me. A black family came in to stay at the hotel. There were quite a few people in their party, maybe 12 or more. No one else was available to help them. Michael wasn't around and the other bellman working that shift was busy with other guests. I decided to help them because I was sure I could. I went to the computer to start the process. The computer was nothing more than a paper thin panel resting on a musician's stand. The panel showed two working screens at once, so two bellman could be working there at one time. The other bellman was working on the one screen and Michael was signed in to the other. I kept trying to set up my account on the screen where Michael had been logged in. I was having trouble because the stand was so unstable, it kept bouncing as I tried to type. I was also having trouble for some other reason. It was taking me way too long. Michael walked up and said it was taking me too long so he was going to go ahead and take care of this family, and proceeded to start the process. He went over to the luggage rack and began scanning their luggage with a hand-held scanner. Maybe he had put tickets with some kind of barcode on each piece of their luggage and he was scanning those. I asked if I could at least do that and he said no. Then I was going into their room with them. I don't know if Michael was with them or not. I went over to the window and showed them how to operate the drapery pull. I was also talking to them about other things and asking them if they wanted this or that. I was thinking that I needed to remember to ask them if they wanted me to get them some ice. In the meantime, they had gone into the bathroom and found the complimentary robes and had changed into them. The robes were gold satin. As I got ready to leave they stopped me to hand me a tip. I thought about saying something to Michael about the unstable computer stand. I quickly decided they probably would not be open to such a suggestion as everyone else seemed be doing well enough with what they had now."
"0923"	"(2004-09-26)"	"I was flying to California to consider moving their for a job opportunity. Matthew was with me. He was only about 8 - 10 years old. He was sitting to my right on the plane. The plane seemed to be traveling on a track similar to a roller coaster, and it was perfectly normal. Even though we were on a normal sized commercial aircraft, we could see out the front window. We had come to a point in the flight, after we had entered California air space, when I knew what was coming. I remembered it from before. I warned Matthew but tried to reassure him so he wouldn't be frightened. I hated this part of the trip. As we looked out the front of the plane it seemed as if the track stopped in mid-air, and that we would tumble and crash. I tried to assure him that wasn't the case, that we just couldn't see the rest of the track from there. As we got to the point where the track seemed to end, you could suddenly see the rest of it - as I knew would be the case. But it did drop off into a steep decline, just like a roller coaster would. The rest of the flight was very much like a scary roller coaster. We are now at our destination but I don't know if we have a rental car that I am driving or how we are getting around. But we are on a highway and I decide to get off at an exit where I see a small restaurant or fast food place. It turns out that there are two very similar places there and I'm trying to decide which one we should be going to. We weren't going there to eat, but I don't know why we are going. I finally decide on one of them, but now I'm inside a place that looks like a hotel. It's the lobby but it also has tables for dining and a bar area out in the open, not in a separate room. It is very nicely decorated with very ambient lighting. There is a golden hue to the area. I'm walking around, almost as though I don't know where to go. I don't want to get the attention of anyone working there because I don't want them to approach me. I headed in one direction and realized that I was walking behind the bar, which was actually divided into three sections. I passed the second opening, between the last two sections, and quickly turned back so I could get from behind the bar using that opening. There were a number of people sitting at various places. I saw someone notice me walking around so I decided to go into the women room. I strongly dislike using dirty restrooms. Every stall that I started to go into was very nasty. The toilets seemed to be nearly overflowing with waste, and there was water or something and paper trash of some kind on the floor. I met eyes with a woman who was just coming out of one stall and she commented about the conditions. I decided to just leave. Now I'm with Matthew again and I tell him it's time to go home. I realize that we have only been there a short time, hours or less, and that is a long trip for such a short stay, but it is necessary. The flight was about three and a half to four hours. It's very odd, but I get on the plane to go home walking in front of Matthew. I go to the very back and sit down on bench seat that goes across the back. There is a large woman sitting to the far left, my left as I sit down, end of the bench. I sit towards the right end but not all the way to the end. Now a very, very large man comes back and sits down between us, but right next to me. He seems to be a very pleasant, good-natured man but this annoys me that he decides to sit there. I don't want to sit next to him on the flight, plus I want to make sure there is room for Matthew. I decide to move all the way to the end and tell the man that my son is going to be sitting with me. I think about sitting something on the bench between me and the man so no one else sits there. I also realize that there isn't much room between us. I feel kind of bad for moving and making Matthew sit there instead of me but decide that he won't mind the way I would, or for the same reasons. He doesn't mind being so physically close to people as I do. I start looking for Matthew and wondering what is keeping him. Then I spot him sitting in a row of seats quite a bit further to the front of the plane. I stand up and do something to get his attention to tell him I am back there so he can come back and sit with me. He stands up and turns around and that's when I notice he has made some new friends and there are all sitting together. I am very sad but decide to just let it go, to let him stay there because he'll have fun with his new friends and because it's a good thing that he has made these new friends."
"0924"	"(2004-09-27)"	"I was in a large meeting room at church. The room was filled with people, all sitting at large round tables. I was either one of the hosts or presenters, but I'm not sure which. It seems to have something to do with CRHP. We were instructing everyone to write thank you notes to the current CRHP group and we were going to do so as well. I didn't know what to write because I didn't know any of these people. I was trying to think of a sincere thank you that could apply to anyone. Now I'm helping to clean up the room and I'm talking to someone about my neighbor. They're telling me I should make more effort to talk to Jasmine U. I'm wondering if it would be okay to ask how old Jordan U is."
"0925"	"(2004-09-28)"	"There was a young woman with a very spirit-like quality to her. She wasn't frightening really, but could be described as evoking some sense of anxiety. There was also another person present, but I can't identify whether it was a man or a woman. The second person kept trying to approach the first, as they got near, the spirit-like woman would suddenly disappear and reappear a further distance away. This happened several times. Throughout, one of them, I think the spirit-like woman, kept calling, Tarkington. Tarkington. I think it was the name of the other person. It was somewhat dark and I believe they were outside. The last time the spirit-like woman moved she seemed to float through the wall of a building. The building was one of many along a street, side-by-side with no space between them, like you would see in a city where the business buildings are all connected. But the buildings seem to be much smaller than normal - not a size that an actual person could walk into, yet bigger than what I would describe as miniatures. The person who had been trying to approach the woman went up to the building that she seemed to float into and was peering inside, wishing they could go in."
"0926"	"(2004-09-28)"	"I was working with Jennifer C. I don't know if I was talking to her or if I was observing her working and trying to figure out how best to address the performance issues I was having with her. I was wondering why she didn't seem to take her work more seriously, why she didn't feel any sense of importance or need to complete things that I would tell her needed to be completed by a certain time, why she hadn't been paying attention to the details, or why she doesn't seem to keep better notes. I was also trying to figure out what to do about it."
"0927"	"(2004-10-02)"	"I was at my birth home and had called some landscaping specialists to come and trim my geraniums, though I don't know why they would be mine. They had grown as tall as the house and had grown into the gutters, like between the gutters and the roof in some cases. One of my brothers or sisters walked up and I explained what was going on. Using my hands I showed them how big around some of the stalks had grown. They were 3-4 inches in diameter. There were so many men there working on this I couldn't keep my eye on all of them at once. Some of the workers were on the roof working and some were on the ground. They were also on various sides of the house. I went to the end of the house where Mother and Daddy's bedroom was and saw that they had cut down a dogwood tree there. I was extremely upset because they weren't supposed to do that and I had no idea why they did. It was not nearly as tall as the house and there was no way that it could be interfering with the gutters. I asked someone about it and they tried to tell me that it would be causing a problem soon and that's why they cut it down. I was very upset and didn't believe them. There was a small Maple tree nearby and I was very stern in telling them not to touch it, to leave it as is. One of my brothers walked up and I told them what happened. I was so afraid of what Mother or Daddy would say about the Dogwood being cut down. I kept walking around the house, watching what they were doing and talking to other siblings that were there. I used my hands to show someone else how big around the Geranium stalks were. I was very nervous that they were going to cut the small Maple tree down as well."
"0928"	"(2004-10-03)"	"I was at my birth home, though it looked different than in waking life. I was outside with Mother and I think some other family members. Mother was sitting in a lawn chair. There was a neighboring house fairly close to ours and the people who lived there were outside as well. I was working on the flowers, mostly ones that had been planted in flower pots. I was picking them up, carrying them over to the right side of the house where Mother was sitting and working on them there. I looked into one of the planters and was surprised at how low the soil had become. Mostly I was adding potting soil and watering them. We were talking as I was doing this. There were a lot of children playing outdoors - from the neighbor's house. I heard the man that lived next door say something about the children playing on the concrete. I looked up and saw a lot of children roller-blading on concrete in the backyard. I realized that it was in our backyard. He didn't seem to think anything of it - of them playing in our yard without asking. I looked up at Mother, wondering how she was feeling about it. I didn't get a sense of whether it bother her or not. I noticed that there was something on the concrete. At first I thought it was snow but then realized it wasn't cold enough outside to be snow so it must be sand. I have no idea why these two big squares of concrete were out there. The neighbor woman was close by and asked if we had seen her garden. Mother said she had a garden as well. I raised my head to look at both gardens. They were about the same size and far back in the yard. You might not even notice them if you didn't know they were there. They both seemed sparsely planted, with the plantings growing as though it were late spring or early summer. Now we were talking about some kind of newsletter that we all seemed involved with. I think maybe the neighbor's were putting it together for a group or organization that we all belonged to but I was editing or reviewing it. At first I thought it was not done well at all and was lacking a lot of much needed information. I decided to let go of those opinions and just review and edit for accuracy."
"0929"	"(2004-10-04)"	"I was at the office with Jennifer C and someone else, I think a friend of hers. There was some kind of bustle going on but I can't decide if it's other people, maybe her children there, or if there is something going on. She decided to quit but was not giving us any notice. Her husband was being transferred so her and their children had to move immediately. She didn't even seem to feel bad that she wasn't giving us any notice. I was trying not to be upset about this, but to instead be understanding. I think she may have asked her sister if she could cover for her at our office until we found someone else."
"0930"	"(2004-10-05)"	"I was thinking about the neighbor's computer/printer problem and trying to come up with a solution for her. I either thought of several didn't things or tried several different things but nothing worked."
"0931"	"(2004-10-06)"	"The mailer for my 1 mil campaign went out and my email box became quickly inundated with emails. I tried to click on one to see the message but couldn't read it because too many emails were coming in simultaneously. Once they finally subsided I was able to read one of them. Some of them were immediate responses, both positive and not so positive. Some of the emails explained why they weren't taking advantage of the offer. Some of the explanations were due to negative experiences with the company, some were neutral - no experience with the company either way but no negative reaction to the campaign, and some were positive feedback about the company and their reason for not taking advantage of the offer had nothing at all to do with us. I had a pile of little cardstock teddy bears in front of me. The body was brown with black facial features. And each one had a oval spot on it's tummy that was either purple or blue I think the other color was. There was a word in the color oval. The teddy bears were made with two pieces actually, the body and the head. They were attached by a bronze rivet that allowed the two pieces to stay attached to each other yet move independently - you could move the head in a complete 360 degree circle. They were all lying so that the head was hanging down, almost completely covering the body and the color oval. As I moved the head on each I could read the word on the oval. On some the word was subscribe. I don't know what the word was on the other because there would have been no need in this campaign for the word unsubscribe. I'm sure that wasn't it. I divided the teddy bears into two piles - one pile that had the word subscribe and the other pile had all the others in it. There were 101 in the subscribe pile. As I was counting I saw that emails were still coming in. I was excited that this was only the initial count. I also wanted to make sure I remembered the number so that when I woke up - and when the mailing actually did go out - I could compare the number from the dream to the actual number. I continued sorting through the teddy bears. I was talking to someone about the results that I was seeing so far, of subscribes, downloads, comments, etc. It seems that some of the ovals may have had the word yes in them, I think it meant that they wanted the free audio. The waking life campaign was not set up this way. If they subscribed to the online newsletter they were automatically taken to another web page where they could immediately download the free audio. No interaction needed with us for that. In waking life there would be no hard copy of anything either. Definitely no teddy bears or any such thing, just emails telling me that people were subscribing. Waking life campaign would also not provide easy access to a contact form for them to respond with feedback."
"0932"	"(2004-10-06)"	"I am driving to the west side of town to deliver a covered dish related for something related to the 1 mil campaign - which makes absolutely no sense. I am driving but Barb M and one of my other CRHP sisters is in the car with me. I seem to be the only with a covered dish. I have made baked spaghetti. I am somewhat anxious about where we're going because it reminds me of KTC or John Mu. I'm not sure why. I think we might be going to the church that John belongs to. Barb M and the other person with me don't seem to be helping me at all with finding where we're going and I'm having trouble. I think I make a wrong turn once or twice. It seems that we're driving around an apartment or condominium complex. We finally find the place where we are to drop off the dish. It is someone's home. A couple comes to the door. As I'm walking away I'm thinking about what they said, though I didn't hear them say it in the dream. They said, What kind of people do this at this time of day. It is very early in the morning and I realize that they were not happy that to have been disturbed so early in the day. It didn't seem that early in the day to me. I forget that probably not a lot of other people routinely get up at 5 am. I think Barb M and the other woman with us waited in the car while I took the dish to the door. When I returned to the car I opened the trunk. In the trunk was a large purple storage container. I open the container and it is filled with food. It seems that other people have made spaghetti dishes and emptied them into this container as it is filled with different types of spaghetti. I think it's just food yet the way it looks it almost looks like there is a paper plate, somewhat folded over, in there as well. I empty my dish into this storage container, which is odd because I left it with the couple. I get back in the car and start driving home but then tell Barb M and the other woman with us that I want to stop and taste the spaghetti. I think if I do I will be able to answer the couple's question. I'm opening the trunk of the car and the storage container again."
"0933"	"(2004-10-07)"	"I had told someone that I couldn't do something they wanted me to do because I was taking care of someone. It seems that it was someone I knew, a friend, but I can't identify him. He was in a bed that was very high - a bit higher than my waist. I lifted the blankets and his shirt a bit and gently placed my hand on his stomach, just rubbing his stomach ever so slowly and gently. He relaxed a bit and said that eased some of the discomfort. My dad used to do that when I was a little girl and sick. Later I'm working in a special care unit of a health care facility, caring for quite a few people with cancer. One of the things I was doing was to provide them with cool compresses that seemed to ease their discomfort."
"0934"	"(2004-10-08)"	"I was driving on S.R. 46. Whenever I was on a section of the road that had no homes I was driving about 75 mph. When I came to places where there were homes I slowed down significantly. I realized that there might be cars pulling out of driveways without looking, or more importantly, that there might be children that run out into the road or across the road without looking first. I was out of my car in the grass and was watching two men playing together with their children. Each of them had one child. One child was a boy and the other a girl. They were hiding behind trees, pretending to have guns and pretending to shoot at each other. I found this very disturbing, that men in this day and age would participate in such play activity with their children. The one man and his daughter looked at me as though they wanted me to play along and I refused. I was talking to some other people, one in particular I know was a man. I was talking about something positive about my drive. I was holding a paper cup in my hand. He told me to watch out for something but now I can't remember what. I was skeptical about what he said. I was probably 95% sure that what he said was not true. As I was driving again I encountered what he had warned me about and realized that I should have been more trusting of what he said. It wasn't that big of a deal. It was more like something that was just an inconvenience as opposed to something that would hurt me, upset me, or cause me any kind of significant mental or emotional turmoil."

"0937"	"(2004-10-10)"	"I was in my mother's hometown on a Sunday evening after dark. Aunt H's house was also my bank. I drove across the front of the house, the house was to my left, and saw that it was closed. They had miniblinds on the front window and door and had them closed. I continue on around the side of the house to see if there was a drive-up window and as I rounded the corner I saw the drive up window at the back of the house. There were either 2 or 3 lanes. I saw cars in 2 lanes. I decided to just drive through as I only needed to make a deposit anyway. Aunt H didn't notice that it was me until after she had stamped something to show there was a $5 fee. As soon as she did that she realized it was me and was saying something about family discount. She took the black rubber stamp and was using it to try to mark out the previous $5 stamp. The stamp she was using, however, was rectangular in shape. In looked like the kind of date stamp that has several belts on it that allows you to turn it to change the day, month, or year. From my car it seemed that I was sitting right next to the drive up window. Aunt P was working at the window as well. Aunt P said something to Aunt H about not being able to use the internet. It was as though she were making fun of her. I think it was part of a conversation they were having with me. Aunt H didn't say much to defend herself. Aunt P also said something about typing in www. I said, you don't always have to do that. She didn't seem to hear me, or she ignored me. I tend to defend anyone that is being treated as an underdog. Whenever someone is talking that way to someone else I probably also tend to say things to bring the attacker down a notch - to show them that they don't know as much as they think they do, so they don't treat others that way. I took a scrap of paper with rough edges and begin to draw a kind of chart to help Aunt H understand the internet. I wrote something at the top and then drew about five circles in a row underneath that. I turned the paper over and did the same thing. In each circle I wrote one internet extension: org, net, edu, com, inc, gov. I'm sitting at a small round kitchen table with Aunt H and explaining my drawing on the second side. I told her to imagine the internet as the world. The world is made up of groups like government, business, schools, people. I went on to say that the internet is the same way and that each internet extension represents a particular group. Like the gov extension represents the government. There are a bunch of other family members in the house. Larry K and Sue K, some of their children and I think some of Linda W's children. They were in different rooms, not where we were. There is also a mature dog and some puppies there. I notice the older dog being really rough to one of the puppies and it really bothered me. The older dog keeps jumping on me and doing other things that is bothering me. Now I'm holding one of the puppies that is very calm and gentle and enjoying it. The dog now comes up and is licking the puppies face and being very gentle and nurturing. Someone, I think Sue K, comments on this - how nice it is, and how gentle the dog can be. We're sitting in another room now and quite a few of the other people are in this room, including Larry K. I don't remember what we're talking about. Someone is teasing him about something. Something is said that leads me to believe that all the weight he has lost has been a result of illness. He looked quite different in the dream, some features like hair color and glasses similar to in waking life, but in the dream he also looked heavier than currently in waking life. He is being light-hearted and laughing, as he usually is. There was also something about luggage."

When I heard it, though, I thought an adaptation of that would be great for my own book - it seemed very profound for my own life. I started thinking about how I might adapt it. I was thinking of things like writing, and journaling."
"0939"	"(2004-10-12)"	"I was watching the Ellen DeGeneres show. She was talking about things that she had set up online that would result in her making donations to the Children's Make A Wish Foundation. The first thing she did was to set up a special search engine. Whenever anyone used this particular search engine she would make a donation to Make A Wish. The second was via her website. There were several things that you could do on her website and whenever anyone did any of these things she would make a donation. The third was independent of these but I think it had something to do with Ellen Degeneres merchandise. This might have been if you bought any of this merchandise online or in a store. But, again, it would result in her making a donation to Make A Wish. I thought it was great that she was doing this. I didn't think I would do much, if any, of the first or third option. However, I thought to myself how much time I spend on the computer and how often I use search engines. So, why not use one that is going to do something good for someone in need? I seemed to be sitting at the computer using this search engine for quite awhile after I heard this."
"0940"	"(2004-10-13)"	"I was at NTNS. Jane H and Janet S had both been fired. I'm watching the members try to run the shop themselves and walking around looking at what they've done with the shop. I'm in the back talking to Janet S, who is processing donations. We're talking about the changes and how difficult it has been for her. Jane H comes in and puts her things in a small square locker. It's her first day back to work. Janet S is standing off to my left. I'm talking mostly to Jane H now, about the changes and about coming back, but we're including Janet S in the conversation. I'm helping them a little bit, to process some of the big items to the floor so they have a little more room to work. The backroom is so full of stuff you can hardly move. There are about six bicycles, at least three of them are adult bikes. We move them out to the sales floor. One of the adult bikes is mine. It's in really sad shape but I thought someone might want it as a cheap fix-up bike. I didn't tell anyone it was mine because they were talking about how sad it looked and the fact that the tires were flat. I just said that someone might want it anyway - it might just need to have the tires inflated or even if they had to buy new tires it would still save them a lot of money from buying a brand new one. I also suggest Jane H price a wooden jewelry box. It's fairly large - yet sits on a piece of furniture, upright, wooden, with glass windows. It has quite a few pieces of jewelry in it. She prices it to be sold with the jewelry. I take it out front to the jewelry counter and move something over to make room for it. I set another thing or two on the bench behind the counter so they can put those things wherever they want."
"0941"	"(2004-10-14)"	"CAS Closed I went to the CAS office after hours - it was night and dark outside. There was a woman on the first floor, working for the landlord in some capacity, that I had to talk to before I went up to our office suite. She gave me a key, I don't know why since I have one, and she also gave me a bag and a box that had two other bags in it. The bags looked like brown grocery bags but were about half that size. The tops were folded over and had a white piece of paper folded over as well and then had been stapled shut. I went up to the second floor to the door of our suite. I used her key to open it and put one foot in and put the single bag against it to hold the door open while I took the box with the other two bags inside. As I was doing this I noticed someone else on the same floor with similar bags. Before I even got inside I realized that the office was completely empty - no furniture or any sign of any company occupying the space. It was then that I realized that the key she had given me said 260 on it and my key to our office suite had number 256 on it. These were office suite numbers. So I thought I had gone into the wrong suite, but this is always where the door to our suite had been before. The bags seemed to have something to do with security but they also seem to have something to do with prescriptions. I have a sense that the other person on saw on the second floor was not supposed to be there. I'm talking to the woman again. I don't know if she came up to the second floor or if I went back down there. I'm explaining to her about the difference in the key and about the suite being empty. I somehow learn that Bill C has moved out - or I'm told that the company has closed. Obviously, I'm extremely upset by this. I'm very panicked. I leave the building and call Bill C. I think I may be talking to him from my car. He's being very flip, almost sarcastic, about closing the company and the way he did - leaving me to find out this way. As we talk I begin to realize that he didn't really close the company. He just decided to close the office and run the company from his home - he and Bryan N. That upset me even more. This is all very different than in waking life."
"0942"	"(2004-10-16)"	"I was having a birthday party for myself at the DDSI office. I was at their office for some other reason, and I don't even know if it's the day of the party or not. I answered the phone and it was Sue P. She was calling to say she wasn't going to be able to make it and something about it being in New Delhi. I thought to myself that was on the opposite side of town and I started to tell her that the party was at their office but decided against it. I decided she probably just didn't want to come and was using that as an excuse so I just let it go. Then I was thinking something about Joanne N and the fact that it was at their office. Now I see Joanne N in the parking lot and I'm talking to her and get the impression that she doesn't know the party is at their office either. I drive to the mall. There aren't many cars in the parking lot. I park pretty far from the door anyway because I don't mind the walk - actually welcome it a bit. I went in to the section of the mall where the movie theater's are. I had gone in to the theater section looking for something or someone and then came back out. There were large wooden double doors to the main entrance of the theaters but I came out a side door. When I came out I noticed a long line of young men standing outside the main door. It was closing time. I smiled to myself because they were all their waiting to pick up their girlfriends when they get off work. Then I hear a woman in her late 20's or early 30's say something about boy bands. Now I realize that all these young men are members of boy bands. She is calling the bands one at a time to go in but I don't know why. I opened one of the doors and turned to look in but hardly did so. I don't know why or what I saw. I hardly even stopped walking as I did it. I realized that it was closing time and I needed to leave so I walked away. I was trying to remember where I parked so I exit the mall entrance that was closest to my car - now that it was dark outside, and actually pretty late at night. There were only a few workers left in the mall, one here and there. I passed two of them. They looked kind of scary to me in the way they were dressed and in their posture. One of them seemed to have a black hooded garment of some type on, with the hood pulled up over his or her head and I could barely see their face. But they looked up as I walked by. I barely made eye contact, looked quickly away and kept walking quickly and with determination. I came to a section where there was a metal wall divider that they pull across and lock when they close. About a hundred feet further down was another one. They were both just pulled partially across. I could have gotten by them on either end or in the middle. I guess each one was two parts. I thought it was best that I head this way to get to my car but wondered if I would be able to get back if I did. One man seemed to stop what he was doing and begin to follow me, but he was pushing a large rubber trash can on wheels. I pointed and shook my finger side to side at him and said Don't follow me. Don't follow me. I tried to walk faster, but still walking backwards so as not to turn my back on these men. I finally got to my vehicle. It was a small white pick-up, like the one Darren used to own. The workers had been scraping the snow in the parking lot and had practically buried the back-half of my truck up to the back of the cab. However the snow was also almost up the window on the drivers side as well. I pushed enough snow to the side to be able to open the door and get in. When I opened the door I saw about 12 inches of snow on the seat that I had put there before I went inside. I was getting a bit nervous now, trying to quickly move enough of that snow off of the seat so I could get in. I finally did and I got in and closed the door. I now opened the passenger door from the inside and was trying to push the rest of the snow from the seat out that door. Suddenly that man was standing behind me and opening the driver's side door. I was angry that he was there and angry with myself that I forgot to lock the door as soon as I got in. The man mockingly waved at me through the window and then opened the door and started to get in. I'm trying to scoot across the seat towards the driver's side door to push him back out with my body. As often happens in dreams I'm finding it hard to make myself move now. I do manage to get him out and get the door closed. But again, I'm having trouble moving to reach up and get the door locked. I don't know if I do or not. It seems there is something about the window being open, partially or all the way. I'm wondering why I didn't just start the engine and drive away just as soon as I got in since I was frightened anyway."
"0943"	"(2004-10-17)"	"I went to my hotel room to change and go exercise. There were a few pieces of exercise equipment sitting outside my room to the left of my door - not to be used. The staff had placed it there temporarily, in the midst of moving it. Now I'm headed to my hotel room again to change to go exercise. This time there is even more equipment sitting outside the door. It's actually blocking my door now. I try to reach in-between the equipment to unlock the door, thinking that if I could get the door open I could squeeze between the pieces to get in. I did get it unlocked but I tried two or three times to go in and something on one piece of equipment kept moving as I did so and hit me in the head each time. I turned around to look for a staff member so I could ask them to have the equipment moved. The door to my room was poolside. There was only about 10-20 feet between my door and the edge of the pool. I saw a staff person in the distance and motioned to them about the equipment and said something about it. I'm not sure if they heard me since they weren't that close to me. I finally got into my room and began changing to go exercise. I was concerned that someone might see me changing. I put on my grey exercise outfit. Then I pulled on a lighter grey pair of exercise shorts. As I did this I was thinking that they were a little tight and got concerned that I had gained weight. Then I realized that I already had another pair on. This pair was tight because I was trying to put them on top of another pair. I wondered if this was a stylish exercise look, decided that it was, so I just kept both pairs on. Then I'm talking to someone about some male athletes who typically don't wear undergarments under their exercise clothes. He was saying this isn't a good thing for someone who is modest because an observer could accidentally see more than desired. I'm seeing a team of men playing beach volleyball. As one of them jumps up to hit the ball his pants fall down. I realize this is what the man was talking about. But the man whose pants had fallen down was wearing underwear. I couldn't help but notice. I saw he was wearing white briefs and was surprised by this because I didn't think it was cool for a man to wear that kind of underwear. With him being a young man I would have thought he would only be wearing things that were cool. "
"0944"	"(2004-10-18)"	"I was talking with Bill C about a certain kind of calendar that I thought would work well for something we were doing. He disagreed with me that such a thing even existed. I told him that I knew they did because I had one at home."
"0945"	"(2004-10-22)"	"I think I was at church, after Mass. I was talking to someone and there people everywhere around me. The person I was talking to pointed to someone and said they were a relative of Marie B. I said, Really? She assured me she was and told me how she knew that. I excused myself and went up to her. As soon as she was finished talking with someone else I introduced myself to her and spoke briefly with her about Marie B. She seemed very cool, aloof, or something - I'm not sure how to describe it. I just told her how much I appreciated Marie B when she was alive and how sad I was to hear about her death."
"0946"	"(2004-10-23)"	"I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and wondered if my period was starting. There was a small spot on my pajamas but I didn't want to turn the light on and disturb my sleep that much."
"0947"	"(2004-10-25)"	"I had gone to spend the night, or I think more than one night, somewhere with a female friend and her young daughter. There were other people there that we knew. I was in bed one night and a man that I knew came in to the room and sat on the edge of my bed, facing me, and began to fondle my breasts. I told him to stop but he didn't want to. I told him again to stop and he became very angry. I was sure if I yelled at him loud enough someone would hear me and he would stop but when I tried to yell I couldn't. Now he appeared to be kneeling on the floor next to bed, facing me. He raised his right arm way out and up so his hand was at the same height of his head. He threatened to hit me if I didn't cooperate. I was trying to decide if I should go ahead and scream or just cooperate so he wouldn't hurt me. This seemed to happen twice, though he never did hit me. Now I'm telling my friend that I want to leave, even though it is in the middle of the night. I didn't tell her why but it was because I was trying to avoid anything sexual happening with this man and trying to avoid him hurting me. I knew that meant we would have to wake her young daughter in the middle of the night. I wasn't sure she would go agree to go without an explanation. I was going through things in my head. I could just go without them. I would be driving during the middle of the night - not an ideal thing for me alone or with someone. I could carry her daughter to the car and she could continue to sleep in the backseat while we drive. Whether I went alone or with them I was still sure it was the right thing to do, to go home now to avoid anything happening with this man."
"0948"	"(2004-10-26)"	"This had something to do with the old TV program Wings."
"0949"	"(2004-10-27)"	"Matthew and bunch of his friends had been at the house for a visit-maybe 10 or 12 of them. They were getting all of the stuff that they had brought with them together, loading up cars and getting ready to leave. Kim and Chris H were with them. Kim came in and someone asked how Chris was. She said something about what he does or how he feels when he lays his head back. I told her that sounds like a concussion and he should go to the doctor. I told her in the meantime to make an ice pack and put that on it. I pointed to where the ziplock bags are and told them to get a kitchen towel, not a paper towel, to wrap it in. There was a baby in a stroller. Ashley B was pushing it outside. I knew it wasn't hers but didn't know whose it was. They had really made a mess. Even though that annoyed me I was still glad they were there. Now I am in bed. I'm sitting up polishing my nails and only have covered with the sheet. I hear Matthew very lightly knock on the door and begin to open it - he thinks I'm asleep. I grab the sheet to cover myself the rest of the way as I don't have anything on. As he enters the room, just wearing his boxers, he tells me that he can't sleep. I told him to go downstairs and put a pot of water on for both of us and I'll be right down. I also tell him not to turn the TV on as that will just work against us. I'm thinking that when I get downstairs I'll get out some turkey too, as that will also help us to go to sleep."
"0950"	"(2004-10-31)"	"I was at OLG Monastery. I think there was some kind of event going on because there were people there that I knew besides the sisters who live there. I think it was people from my SDI class. Or maybe it was family - or some of both. It might just be coincidence that I see someone there that I know. I had gone to use the bathroom. To the left and in front of the toilet were two closet kind of spaces, but instead of doors there were shower curtains. They had so much stuff in them that the shower curtains were pushed out a bit rather than hanging straight down. I pulled the curtain in front of me to the side a bit to look inside. I was talking to one of the sisters about professional closet organization. They had either won the service or someone was donating it. I was telling her it wasn't going to be anything elaborate or expensive, but rather something simple, neat and yet much more functional than what they have now. As I'm talking I'm thinking about their coat closet in the reception area. I'm motioning with my hands and saying, you know, a place to hang coats but also a place for hats, handbags and umbrellas. While I'm saying this I'm envisioning a wood organizing system and I'm wondering what the closet people will do for umbrella storage."
"0951"	"(2004-10-31)"	"I'm with a bunch of other people, at least some are family. I see a child running around, kind of playing, with a small container holding several wafers of the Holy Eucharist. I'm upset that this is occurring. Someone tells me that Daddy gave this to the child. His intentions were good as he wanted the child to know about the Holy Eucharist, become familiar with it, and appreciate it as much as he does. The container was the same size in diameter as the wafers but it was three or four times deeper than the ones we use to take communion to the homebound. It was gold in color. It was still very upsetting to me that he had given this to a child because I thought the Eucharist in it was consecrated. I was talking to someone about this and they didn't think that it was. I was saying that, even so, I didn't think it was a good idea because it wasn't teaching the child proper respect for the Eucharist - and what if it was in fact consecrated. How can one be absolutely sure one way or the other? I was having a conversation with Daddy but I don't know if we talked about this at all. We did talk about his good intentions in how he talks to others about God and religion, especially when he sounds like he is lecturing, or telling others how to live. I wanted him to understand how it makes people feel, how it feels judgmental and how it sometimes just makes people feel very uncomfortable. I was trying to be gentle yet honest. I wanted to be careful what I said or how I said it because I didn't want to hurt him or cause him to become upset. I'm not sure he understood what I meant. He didn't seem to get very upset."
"0952"	"(2004-10-31)"	"I was doing computer work for an association of some kind. It seems that they had a number of chapters in the association or they served the public in some way. I'm not sure if the thing I was working on was purely on their website or if I was working on something that was part of the website or that they or I thought should be on their website. It feels like I was trying to make sure this thing was available to people, or that it was consistent with-or compatible with - another thing that belonged to other people. Maybe it is some kind of an online quiz, or survey. But it seems that there is one bit of information that I feel either needs to be inputted into all versions or that what I am working on needs to be able to accept this one bit of information. That doesn't feel like an exactly right description but the best I can come up with."
"0953"	"(2004-11-01)"	"I was creating some kind of flyer or brochure or something at the computer for a group of people. I don't know if it was for a business or a group of people that shared a hobby. I would make changes, show it to them or discuss it with them and make more changes. I did this many, many times."
"0954"	"(2004-11-03)"	"I was at CTS meeting with Felicity K. We were talking about my dissertation. Jack P arrived. I had invited him to be on my committee some time ago when I thought my topic was going to be spirit in the workplace. When he came in I was talking to him like nothing was wrong, all the time trying to figure out what to tell him or what to do. I felt bad that he had come here for nothing, because I couldn't have him on my committee now. I was explaining to him why I had invited him, saying that it was because I respected him and valued his opinion. Myself, Felicity K and some other people were working on some kind of project. We had to make some kind of a model out of heavy-duty electric extension cords. They weren't the typical orange colored ones however. They were dark colors like black and dark blue and such. I was having trouble doing much with mine. Felicity K had been successful but I don't remember now what hers was. I looked at someone else's and said, Oh. You've created a crown of thorns. They said no and told me what it was. It was round in shape and had a few of the old-fashioned sized Christmas lights standing up a bit here and there. I thought the lights represented the thorns."
"0955"	"(2004-11-03)"	"I was with Bill F, Matthew and Rachel S in the city where I live. I think we were in something like a van because I was in a seat in a middle row and Rachel S was in a seat behind. I turned around because she said something to me as she was fastening her seat belt. I said that her mom and dad forgot to give us her booster seat and she said she doesn't have to use it anymore. I found that hard to believe since she is only five, but we didn't have much choice except to stay at home. Bill F and Matthew were in the front seats but I don't know who was driving. We were driving by BR Park. We saw a lot of people there. There was a place in the park, unlike in waking life, that was kind of like a river bed in width but not as deep as you would expect a river to be, and it seemed to be paved and light blue in color. Yet there was some water in it, maybe a little more than ankle deep. A path or roadway crossed over it at one point. There were a lot of people playing in the water. Matthew commented that he remembered he and I going there and doing that, but that it had been a long time. So we decided to stop and walk over there. Rachel S said she wanted to because she always enjoys chirping. I didn't even question what she meant by that word because I knew and it didn't strike me as odd at all. I've also gotten so used to her adult-like language that I didn't say anything about her saying, I always enjoy. When we got parked and got out of the car we also saw a small round area that looked somewhat like a wading pool, but that wasn't it's actual purpose. It was made with brick. There was also a round something in the middle, leaving a space about a foot in width where people were wading, either walking through the water or sitting by the edge dangling their feet in. Rachel S came up to me carrying a child's plastic picnic table. She turned it upside down and was doing something. I said, No. This is a picnic table. I turned it over and sat it upright. She got a little upset with me and headed over to the wading pool thing. I told her she needed to remove her shoes and socks. As she did she kicked them under something so I bent over to pick them up. I put her socks in her shoes so they wouldn't get lost and they walked over to the wading area with her. She decided she didn't want to get in there but I'm not sure why. There was another area with water in it also. It was more rectangular in shape. The water was a little deeper, like up to the knees on Matthew. He was in there. I picked up Rachel S under the arms and asked Matthew to take her and let her dangle her legs and feet in the water. Now she was in a pair of shorts and t-shirts but before she had been in a dress. I knew the water was too deep for her to stand in it by herself and I didn't want her to get her clothes wet."
"0956"	"(2004-11-03)"	"I was working with some computer software. It had a number of different fields on the screen I was working with, kind of like the SF software we use at the office.

"0957"	"(2004-11-04)"	"I was part of a team participating in a home improvement contest. There were two parts to the contest. One part was the actual physical improvements to the home and the other part was something on paper but I can't describe that."
"0958"	"(2004-11-06)"	"I was at Bill C's house. He and Jane C were getting ready to go on a bike ride. I was going to stay there with his two daughters, Kelly C was younger than in waking life. We were going to be painting some things that were sitting in their garage. There were two different types of things but several of each. One looked like a bunch of window shutters. We were painting them a rose color, a very dark pinkish-red. We didn't finish before Bill C and Jane C came back. Jane C was questioning us, but I'm not sure if it's because we hadn't finished or she didn't think we were doing a good enough job or what exactly. We were also cleaning up and preparing for some kind of event. I picked up a package that turned out to be a new package of underwear for Bill C. It was the standard white what I think they refer to as jockey shorts or what I have also heard referred to as tidy-whities. I was surprised that Bill C would wear this type of underwear. It just didn't seem like his style. The event was getting underway but we were somewhere other than there house. There were a lot of people. We had three lines going where people could enter and each line was fairly long. Jane C and I were monitoring the lines, greeting people, and helping with things there."
"0959"	"(2004-11-07)"	"I was in St. Joe. In had been, or maybe still was, pouring down rain. I was with someone but I'm not sure who. A man approached me and was very upset. His car was sitting at a business, I think maybe an auto shop or something similar. His family was in the car and being flooded. The people who owned the business wouldn't let him go to the car to save his family. I have no idea why they should even have a say in the matter. I tried to calm him and went with him to where his car and family were. I spoke to the owners of the business and resolved the matter. The man went to the car and was able to get the car started and backed out of the flooding waters."

We're sitting fairly close together, with maybe just 2-3 feet between us. I'm sitting in a regular office guest chair and he is sitting in an office desk chair without arms. I'm wondering if I should really be talking to him about this, questioning his credibility on the subject. Then I think, Oh. But being a dentist he is a medical doctor too, just like psychiatrists are. So I relax and finish the conversation."

"0963"	"(2004-11-08)"	"I was doing computer work, helping couples with things related to their weddings, doing things like labels for invitations and something that seems to be the actual invitation itself. I'm also doing something with emails related to the weddings. I'm thinking that the guests that the couples don't have email addresses for are going to miss out - not receiving the email everyone else will be receiving. I am cutting and pasting or exporting information into email messages - the address and subject boxes - from another software. I can't make it work correctly though, as every time I try it changes the size and such of those boxes and runs them off the page. At first I try resizing each box, then I try other things to keep it from happening. I spend most of the dream trying and retrying this, and getting extremely frustrated."
"0964"	"(2004-11-10)"	"I was driving through a parking lot getting ready to park outside of a grocery store. I've seen this parking lot before in a dream but it is unfamiliar in waking life. It was dark outside, very early morning, and not many cars in the lot. I finally parked in the second row from the front of the store, 3 or 4 spaces from the end of the row. It seems to me that there were some people, or at least one man, standing on a perpendicular sidewalk watching me. I have the feeling that he was watching my driving, though there was nothing wrong with it. I went in to the store and began down one of the aisles and then decided I needed a shopping cart so turned around and went back to the entrance to get a cart. The store seemed dark and dingy."

"0966"	"(2004-11-16)"	"Jane C was working for a membership organization. I was having a discussion with her and some other people and she was implying that the members of her organization were lower class than other similar organizations. To help make her point she picked up a bottle and said, See, American Roadhouse. The bottle was some type of condiment from a table, such as in a diner. I knew what she meant but I didn't know exactly what was in the bottle. I continued to think about it and then realized American Roadhouse probably made three such offerings. Ketchup, Steak Sauces, and Bar-B-Que Sauce. I don't think we were actually at a diner though, because it seemed that we were at an office, at a computer, talking about software or entering the members into the computer. But it also seems that we had started with a discussion about members' needs. That is why Jane said what she did - to make a point that her members were happy with less than in many similar organizations."
"0967"	"(2004-11-16)"	"I had put some kind of skin treatment on the palm of my hands. Shortly after I did I realized that I should have put it on the outside of my hands, and extended down onto the outside of my fingers. I was either thinking that I could just go ahead and rub what was on each palm on to the outside of the opposite hand or if I actually did it. I also realized that to remove it, when the treatment time was over, I just needed to rub it with the opposite hand."
"0968"	"(2004-11-20)"	"I was creating an Excel spreadsheet to help Bob F and family. I had taken a spreadsheet that I had created for another purpose and was making changes to it, thinking that this was going to help their family deal with the very difficult situation they are currently trying to figure out how to work through. The weird part is that it has nothing to do with finances or anything like that. It is strictly mental and emotional."
"0969"	"(2004-11-22)"	"I was doing laundry, but I don't know where. BJ came up and was going to do a load also. She asked me about something so I bent down to the ground to check a water drain. I was outside now and there was a hole in the grass about six inches in diameter. There was a beige rubber cover for it that was supposed to provide a seal when you put it on. It was kind of bent in almost in half though and couldn't be undone to actually cover the hole or provide a seal. I could see water almost up to the edge. The cover was actually floating on the water on the inside of the hole rather than lying outside of it. There was another where BJ was standing, but her's fit and worked the way it was supposed to. There was some laundry lying on top of the machines. The washer was to the right of the dryer. I had clothes in the dryer and some clothes on top of it. BJ had put clothes in the washer. I noticed that she didn't separate her permanent press things from her towels and such. I figured that she did it because she only had enough for one load so she put it all together instead of doing two small loads. I thought that if I had known she could have just done hers with mine. I was getting ready to take Matthew to the dentist. He was about the same age as he is in waking life. I said something about his dental insurance, or asking him if he is insured. Then I asked him if he wanted to see the same dentist he saw the last time and he said yes. I knew he had seen Doctor Alison [unknown in waking life] , my dentist's partner. I was standing in front of a four-drawer filing cabinet that was a bit shorter than normal and the overall dimensions of the drawers and files were smaller than normal. The top drawer had tabbed cardboard dividers in it that had hand-written labels on them. They weren't very easy to see. The files seemed to be a bit of a mess. I found the one that said Alison on it and pulled it out just a bit then put it back in. As I was doing this I remembered that Doctor Alison is female and wondered how I would feel about a female dentist - if it would make me more comfortable. Though I've always really liked my own dentist. I went in the house to get my purse and saw Bev's purse lying there as well. She was a child of about six. She came in and was going to go with me. I said, Do you want your purse, missy? She indicated that she did so I picked it up and handed it to her as we were on our way out. I saw three of Darren's employees as I was headed out - two women and a man. They were all dressed in black and orange for Halloween. They thought he was gone for the day so they were skipping out of work and going to do something for Halloween. They seemed angry that I had caught them. Their first response was denial that they were doing anything wrong and then they just acted as if they didn't care. Darren was there as well. One of these women was going to drive and I was getting in the front seat with her. Darren and Bev were going to get in the back seat. This woman started pulling away as he was helping Bev into the car. I started screaming at her, Stop. Stop. Stop. She looked at me and kept driving. I kept turning my head between her and the back of the car trying to see where Bev was but couldn't see her. The other woman was in the backseat and was yelling at her as well. We kept yelling. I was getting so angry. I didn't understand why she wouldn't stop and didn't know what to do. I think I finally grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it so the car would go off the road. She finally stopped. At that point I realized that Bev had not been hurt - that either Darren had pulled her away from the car in time to prevent her from being hurt or she had stepped far enough away in time to not be hurt. I was so angry."
"0970"	"(2004-11-22)"	"There were either two groups of people or two people that represented two groups. Each group lived in very different cultures. We were trying over and over to come to some compromise that would allow us to respect each other's cultural differences and yet feel respected ourselves. I was determined that we could find something that both groups would be okay with. We did not find a resolution before I woke up."
"0971"	"(2004-11-26)"	"I was working on some kind of project with my siblings. It seems to have something to do with either our parents or the entire family. The imagery in one part of this dream reminds me of the computer card game FreeCell, but we were definitely not playing a card game and I don't think it was on a computer. It seems that I was the one working on this part. Just like in the card game, I was putting groups of similar things together. Then I would move them, back and forth as able or appropriate. Again, just like the card game. And even the things I was grouping and moving seemed to be the same size as playing cards and seemed to be laid out like a FreeCell game board. There was also an image that reminds me of a giant neon billboard, where individual letters and numbers were made up of a series of lightbulbs. I can only remember one of the four words or groups of words. It said 100%. I had it put up. Brian F had something put up. I was talking to BJ and said something what Brian F put up needing the word of in it. She told me that she had said something to him about it - that I had mentioned that and she told me his response. I thought about what she said, and the very fact that she said it made me determined not to change it. Later, BJ and I were in a car together. She was driving. We went to Grandma F's house. I think she was dropping me off there, like my car had been parked there. I was going to go home from there. We both got out of the car and hugged. We were still talking about something - something very sad or worrisome about the family - and we both started crying a little bit. As I was hugging her and talking I saw Rosemary B drive up, seemingly from the field, but in a car. It was as though she lived back there somewhere and it was perfectly natural for her to be driving up from there. I knew she would be wondering what was going on and talking to people in town about it. I had mixed feelings about this. It bothered me some and yet I didn't care. Actually, I think it bothered me a lot but I wanted to not care."
"0972"	"(2004-11-27)"	"This was about selling CAS products. It seems that I was talking to someone but I may have just been working on this stuff - alone. It was important that we use online retailers and that we create hard-copy marketing pieces for the expensive titles. Also that we not spend the money for BCB to have it's own site. I asked Bill C. to do a search on the web of a few popular titles by other authors and see how many of them have their own site. I don't think he'll find many."
"0973"	"(2004-11-27)"	"I was standing facing a plaid sofa. Someone was sitting there, a male I think. I saw a penny laying on the sofa, then just a minute or two later I saw two pennies there. The person sitting there was getting ready to eat a muffin and broke it in half. I think there was another muffin sitting there, on the sofa. It seems that he either broke the muffin open to see if there was something inside of it or because there was something inside of it. Maybe that's where the second penny came from."
"0974"	"(2004-11-30)"	"I drove to Kendall B's home to discuss my studies. His wife was there along with his children, though I don't know that he has as many children in waking life. It seems there were at least four in the dream. He also had a lot of dogs and cats - they were the size of puppies and kittens but don't know that they weren't full-grown. They all seem to be black or very-dark colors. I was concerned about the cats because of my allergy to cats. I was talking to Kendall B but he had his back to me, sitting in a chair something like an outdoor chaise lounge. It was a big open room with very little in it. His wife was there also. Kendall B left the room for some reason. There was a white or beige sofa in the room but I was hesitant to sit down because of my cat allergy. The dogs and cats were running around my feet. I was having a conversation with his wife. She asked me how I came to be studying under Kendall B. I told her about my emailing him about 5 or 6 years ago and asking him to be my dreamwork mentor. When I got ready to leave it was dark outside. I was backing out of the driveway and being careful because I wasn't sure if I could see clearly enough to know that there were no cars coming and to make sure I didn't hit a mailbox or anything."
"0975"	"(2004-12-01)"	"I went to Tony S and Dorothy S's house. The level of comfort with each other that we once shared wasn't there, at least for me and Dorothy S. We sat in one room talking for awhile and then got up and went to another room - maybe the living room. I think we were having a dessert as we sat in the living room and talked. But as we went in and sat down Dorothy S said something to me about my long absence from their lives. I made a casual comment as tears began to fill my eyes, and I tried to fight them back. I knew it was time to discuss it. I don't know that I went there to discuss it, but I'm pretty sure that I went because I felt it was time to bridge the gap. As I sat there I tried to remember why I quit going to see them. Was it something they did or said? Or was it simply that I was the only one putting any effort into the friendship? I think their two younger daughters came into the room. I didn't recognize them. They had grown up and changed so much over these many years. They had several young girls with them that they were babysitting. I initially thought these young girls were their daughters and quickly realized that was impossible due to the years that had gone by. We talked for a short time about their daughters. A large group of other people showed up. I don't know if it was planned or not. At least some of the other people who showed up were family. Dorothy S began to talk with them. I didn't know if I should stay or leave. At that point I wanted to have the conversation with them about my absence, but not with all of these other people there. I decided to stay a little while longer and just see if these other people were going to leave. Tony S stayed in the room with me. He said he was feeling uncomfortable. That's unusual for him to ever be uncomfortable around someone. I mentally debated again if I should stay or go."
"0976"	"(2004-12-02)"	"Our CIIS was meeting at Karyn L's. She was living in a two-story townhome. The neighborhood looked very similar to my own, at times even seemed to be my own. When I arrived she was doing something in the kitchen and invited me to go upstairs where the others were gathering. There was a large open room up there, maybe a living room. I went up and began saying hello and chatting with people. It wasn't the kind of greeting we would typically have in waking life though, no hugs or anything like that. After a few minutes I decided to go home and get something and come right back. I didn't think I could make it back before we began but decided to go anyway. We were supposed to begin at 9:30 am. As I was walking back I saw all of the teenagers gathering at different places to get on the school bus. I was walking alongside two black girls who were headed the same direction as I. We were chatting casually and I said something about where we were each headed. They pointed out that I was headed to one side of one building and they were headed to the other and I nodded in agreement. Yet, when we parted company we did just the opposite. As I went to the other side of that building there were a bunch of teenagers gathered there and they had music playing and were dancing. I smiled as I watched them dancing and having fun. I made my way through them to the end of the building. I double-checked the last door on the building to see if it might be the door to Karyn L's. There was a screen door and the other door was open so I could see in. It didn't appear to be the right one. I realized the house numbers were either not visible or very hard to find. I walked around the end of the building and tried to remember if her's was the last door or second to last. Again, I had trouble finding the house numbers and wasn't even sure I remembered what they were if I did see them. I looked in another screen door and decided this was the right one, so I went in. As I did so Karyn L was finishing up whatever she was doing in the kitchen. She had a very large dog. It reminded me of a chocolate lab. It didn't bark and wasn't aggressive but it did come up to me. I put my hand underneath its jaw and moved it a little - partly as an affectionate gesture but partly so he wouldn't slobber on me. I did this as I walked past him and followed Karyn L upstairs. As we got to the stairs she had a small dinner bell that she began to ring to let everyone know it was time to start. I looked at my watch and it was nearly 9:45. I noticed that we weren't starting on time, which wasn't unusual, but I was also glad because that meant I wasn't late."
"0977"	"(2004-12-02)"	"At some point I said to myself, This is weekend at Bernie's. But I've never watched that movie. Yet, it wasn't a movie in the dream, it was something that we were living. Most of the time I was with just one other woman, but there seemed to be a group of people who knew each other and were together. We were in an area that looked like an apartment complex. Myself and the woman I seemed to be with primarily were moving stuff from the back of a pickup truck into the back of another pickup truck. Our husband was helping us and we were thanking him for being so nice about this. As we were finishing up he went inside. As soon as he did we did something to another woman, who also seems to be his wife. Her hair was blonde, straight, and the length was just above the shoulders. She was average-size, average-size for American women in today's society. I think we just knocked her out - so we would be alone with him. We wanted to leave her in the first pickup truck, which is why we wanted to move the other stuff to the other pickup truck, so he wouldn't know what we were up to. He came back out because we were getting ready to go somewhere. He said he had to use the bathroom before we left and we panicked because we thought he would have to walk past the other truck and then he might see what we did. He returned from the bathroom with a handkerchief in his hand and he appeared to be crying. Then we really panicked because we thought he did see and was crying because we had killed the other woman. As he walked towards us he either spit something into his handkerchief or wiped something from his mouth. He looked to be something round, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Then he said something to the effect of, When did they stop the dripping at the urinals? This is why he was upset, but we realized that he wasn't crying and we realized that the bathroom was close by so he didn't have to walk by the other truck at all. We thought we were clear. He got in the driver's side and I climbed in the passenger side. He said something warm about me being there and I responded in like manner. I buckled my seatbelt but then unbuckled it because I realized the other woman I was with would need to get in also. As I moved over to the center of the bench seat in the truck I said something to him about being even closer to him and he smiled. She got in. I wasn't sure where the seatbelt was for the middle of the bench but found it quickly and buckled it. I put my left hand flat between his thighs and placed my right hand on his right arm as we got comfortable for the drive. He was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. I noticed what a nice tan he had on his arms and legs. As we prepared to pull away we noticed some emergency workers coming from the direction of our other truck. They were carrying a stretcher that appeared to have a dead body on it. Once again we panicked, realizing that they found the other woman and now our husband was going to find out that something happened to her, and maybe that we did it. As the EMT's walked by with the stretcher we realized her head was uncovered. She turned her head, looked at us - primarily at our husband - and lifted her head and mouthed something to him. The gist of it seemed to be what's going on? Now the woman I've been collaborating with and myself went inside where some of the other women we knew were sitting and talking. Someone said something about what happened to the third woman and the fact that she would no longer be able to run for or hold the office she had been holding. Someone said, I vote for ____. It was myself or the other woman I was with. They were not going to have an election but rather just decide right then and there and make it effective immediately."
"0978"	"(2004-12-05)"	"We, at CAS, were doing some kind of job for three different high schools. I was driving to one of the schools and had one of the female students who was involved in the project in the car with me. We got to the school and were talking to some other adult(s) there. Bill C arrived and wasn't happy with something that was going on with one of the schools. It was one that both Bryan N and I were involved in the project. He thought it was my fault. I was just thinking, if it was my fault why is there no problem with the other two schools that only I am handling? There were four objects sitting in front of me. There were about 6 inch square but shaped like a corn hole game box. They each had a circle in the top of them as well - that was indented but not a hole. Three of them were blue and one was colorless - white or clear. The difference in the color of the one had something to do with the problem and I knew Bryan N was responsible for it."
"0979"	"(2004-12-11)"	"Bev was talking to one of her children as they were shutting off my snooze alarm for me. It went off at their house the same time it went off at mine. It was set up this way so they could help me make sure I didn't oversleep when I had to be somewhere at a certain time. Each time I hit snooze at my house they would shut the alarm off at their house. We did this about three times. Bev was explaining to her child why we were doing this, and why she wasn't doing anything else when the alarm went off. She explained that if it was serious something else would go off or she would receive some other kind of notification that she would act on. I was wondering about all of this, trying to figure it out myself - as though I were awake. Then something else happened and I realized that it also happened at her house and that is what would make her do something to help me wake up."
"0980"	"(2004-12-11)"	"I drove through a very large car wash - unlike any I've seen in waking life. It looked like the type of large overhang many gas stations have that extend from their building out over several gas pumps to keep customers dry when it rains. The water for the car wash seemed to be coming down from this overhang, over the entire area, and whether any cars drove through it or not. I seemed to have entered it by mistake and had to figure out how to get out. I noticed toward one end if I turned a bit to the right and then to the left I would exit. At these points there were also some type of black posts, fairly small in diameter, that also seemed to have water shooting out horizontally. I had to drive between these to exit. I was getting ready to enter a McDonald's drive-thru to order breakfast. It was a very wide driveway. There was a car to the left with some people standing around it outside. There were also some people standing in the driveway to the right. I was baffled that none of these people seemed to be concerned that they were in the drive-thru and didn't seem to be at all concerned about being in the way of cars coming thru or about getting hit by these cars. As I pulled up to the speaker I was thinking about the fact that it has been years since I have had breakfast at a fast food place - something so unhealthy. As I came to a stop I heard the employee ask me what I wanted, they actually asked me about something in particular - one of their breakfast sandwiches. As I said, no thank you, I felt like I had to rush and order something. I knew I didn't want what they suggested. I didn't think I wanted anything like it because it was so unhealthy, but at the same time I was thinking that I used to enjoy the taste of their breakfast sandwiches. I was looking at the menu on the sign but was having trouble identifying anything quickly, so I finally just decided on something even though I wasn't at all sure that's what I wanted."
"0981"	"(2004-12-25)"	"I was thinking that I needed to water my plants and give them some attention. I realized that I had not been watering the ones on the screened porch. The porch was a long narrow room, not much wider than a hallway. It looked unfinished, like bare wood or at least wood that had just been stained, but not finished. I was also thinking about the African violets on the kitchen windowsill."
"0982"	"(2004-12-26)"	"I was at the CAS office. I opened a file drawer and it was almost full with red file folders. Each file had a white label on it with a series of numbers. I don't know if the numbers were a date or something else. Each folder also had a stack of papers in them about one half inch thick. They were all very uniform. As soon as I saw them I realized it confirmed my suspicions either that Bill C has Attention Deficit Disorder or that he suspects that he has and has been either researching it or testing himself."

"0985"	"(2004-12-27)"	"I was working on Daddy's video at the computer, particularly the part with Kaitlyn S in it. I kept trying different things trying to find the thing I liked, or trying to decide what I liked best.

"0986"	"(2004-12-28)"	"I was creating three different movie videos, at the computer, for each of my family members. As I was working on them I became concerned about getting them confused so decided to name each of them Movie I, Movie II, and Movie III, each with the person's name after the Roman numeral. I was talking to someone else about some concern I had with them or some problem I was having creating them. I think it was a family member that I was talking to, and by phone not in person."
"0987"	"(2004-12-28)"	"I was in a huge store that appeared to be a combination of grocery store and other items. The shelves weren't as high as in a typical grocery store. They were just a little taller than I am and I could see over the top of them just enough to see other parts of the store. Twice I asked employees to direct me to something I was trying to find and they walked with me to where the item was located. The third time I asked the store manager where something was located and he just gave me very vague directions and pointed to the general area. I said, Okay. I'll try to find it, and walked over to that area. He had something about where the grocery section starts. As I neared that area I better understood what he meant. I saw that there was a restaurant in the store as well. The restaurant tables were 8 foot rectangles made of heavy, natural-colored wood. It had a very rustic look and feel. Just past the last table in one section I noticed that is where the grocery section of the store started. I think it was lunchtime because the restaurant tables seemed to be completely full. I was thinking that many professional workers must be on their lunch break. Now I am in another part of this building and talking to a friend about meeting me there for lunch. We are both attending a conference there - it seems maybe an SAID conference. I have another friend that I invited to the conference and she was attending for the first time. I realize that I should be having lunch with her since I invited her, it's her first time there, and she doesn't know anyone yet. I invite her to meet me for lunch at the same time and place. As I approach the table I say something like, Yes. I have two friends. There's no reason why I can't have lunch with both at the same time. My reasoning is that it gives the new person an opportunity to meet someone else at the conference. As we're having lunch we're discussing the possibility of this place hosting a conference - again, the SAID conference. Some issue comes up about ice and I tell the employee that it is something they will need to address if they truly want to be considered as an SAID conference facility. A bit later something comes up about soft drinks. This time, a manager explains the situation to me. He is a younger man, maybe early thirties, with dark black hair trimmed close to his head. He has olive skin. I think he looks like a typical New York Italian and just as quickly think what a stereotypical thought that is and how inappropriate it is for me to think something like that. I don't like it that I had such a thought. I understood what he meant when he explained about the soft drink problem. He was sitting at a far side of the room with some other people, while I was sitting more near the middle of the room with my friends. I told him I understood about the problem but that, again, it is something that would need to be addressed if the location was to seriously be considered as an SAID conference site."
"0988"	"(2004-12-31)"	"I decided to go to Lily H's wedding reception. I had been taking a nap on the sofa, though my home looked different than in waking life - more like my birth home. I got up from the sofa and went to get the invitation to check the location and to see if it said anything about gifts.. As I was thinking about all of this I decided that I should return the things that I had borrowed from her - that I could take them with me to the reception. I went and got a portable sewing machine and carried it outside to the car. There was a sidewalk between the house and the driveway that looks like my birth home also. At the crook in the walkway was sitting a base and a cover for the sewing machine. I looked up and saw that my driver's side car door was open as well as the trunk lid. I realized that I had started to put these things in the car the night before, had opened up the car and then forgot about it. I knew my car battery was going to be dead now and I would have to call AAA to come and start it for me. I went ahead and put the sewing machine on the base and put the cover on. I couldn't decide whether to put it on the floor of the back seat or in the trunk. I arrive at the location of the wedding reception and I see six or eight women in bikinis lying in the grass working on their tans. They are all very petite women. I make a comment to someone to the effect that if I had known this I probably wouldn't have come. I went inside and see a row of massage tables. They are all occupied, again with very thin women wearing bikinis. A hostess comes up to me and encourages me to get a massage. As soon as one person, or guest, is finished another takes their place on a table. I notice two small, but different sizes and shapes, vinyl cases sitting on the floor by each table. These are gifts for the wedding guests. I'm thinking what a nice idea this whole thing is for a wedding reception - to give their guests an afternoon of pampering and relaxation. The tables aren't very wide at all - not as wide as even a small body. I watch a couple of other people climb onto the tables first. They are kind of straddling them with their legs and then lying down. That doesn't seem very graceful to me so I attempt to get on another way but find my way to be no more graceful. I don't feel very stable on these narrow tables.. The masseuse asks me if I'm comfortable and I tell her that. She tells me just to relax. The one end of the table has a piece that angles down. She tells me to place my neck at the angle and let my head drop down. I try to figure out what to do with my arms since the table isn't wide enough for me to rest them on the table. She tells me to cross my wrists above my head. Another woman is trying to talk me into dying my hair. I am very hesitant but notice that they are doing this to all the other guests as well. I finally agree to let her do what she is suggesting. As I am waiting for her to complete that process someone else walks up to me and makes a comment about my new hair color. She hands me a mirror and I try not to become concerned or upset. My hair looks orange. I do become concerned and the woman who colored my hair comes up and I and the other woman both express our concern. Now a manager comes up and the four of us are talking about what to do about it. The manager and the person who did it don't think they can do anything about it. The first woman who said something to me doesn't seem to agree with them. I decide to just have them wash it out and dry my hair. I privately tell the first woman that I'll just go home and recolor it myself to try to fix it. I tell her that it's not the first time that I haven't been happy with such an attempt and I've been able to fix it that way before. I show her a standard size piece of paper that has full color printing and pictures of some type on it. I'm showing it to her because it shows that what they tried to do started out fine, like it was fine on one side of the paper, but then it didn't work on the other side. It seems that maybe one side of the paper looked fine but the other side looked like the paper had been folded and the print and images had transferred from one section of the paper to the other. I tell someone that I brought the things with me that I wanted to return to Lily H. A man that I know is standing nearby and overhears me. He offers to walk out to my car with me and move the things to Lily and Richard H's car. As we're walking out to my car I tell him that four years ago when I lost my job at the hospital, Lily H loaned me a portable sewing machine and a small TV and I have just recently been able to replace them. He smiles and nods his head as I am talking, in recognition of this helping characteristic of Lily H."

They were along the same wall as the staircase so when I came downstairs the sofas blocked most of the bottom of the staircase. There was very little room to get around and into the room. It took me a couple of seconds to realize what he had done. He was in the living room going through stuff and getting settled back at home. I asked him about something and then said, Oh, but you're only here for a week."

"0991"	"(2005-01-03)"	"Matthew was home. We were supposed to be going to a family gathering at Todd A's, but I don't know where that was. We were talking about the weather, about how neither of us wanted to do the driving, and concerned about whether or not we should even go because of snow. It occurred to me that we could call Jody S and see if we could ride part of the way with her. that might help some. Then I was having a conversation with BJ. She was going from home. We were at home. So I must have been talking to her by phone but I could see her. She said it would take her about four hours. I was trying to decide how to respond to that because I didn't understand why it would take her twice as long as it normally takes Matthew and I to make that drive. I think I finally just said, Really? It normally takes us about two hours."
"0992"	"(2005-01-04)"	"My alarm went off, in my dream. I hit snooze and fixed some html code at the beginning of a line of coding. I wasn't in front of a computer and I didn't seem to have a paper and pen with me so I don't know how I was doing this. I did this probably a dozen times. Then my alarm went off in waking life and I shut it off and went back to sleep. I thought I should finish this coding all at once rather than doing it one line at a time the way I was."
"0993"	"(2005-01-04)"	"I was working in the flowerbeds in the front of my townhome. I was standing, bending over and pulling weeds. not the way I normally weed my flowerbeds. One or two of the employees from the community office were walking up the sidewalk. I think they were going to talk to my next-door neighbor. As they were walking someone asked them about getting something in their home repaired. They seemed to be further away from me but they were loud enough that I couldn't help but hear everything very clearly. The employees were saying that they were going to take care of it and explained something about being very busy or taking care of one family at a time. or both. When the employees were gone I turned around and was going to say something to the person who asked them the question, thinking that it was my next-door neighbor. As soon as I turned around I realized that it wasn't. I saw a white woman with short black hair. She was doing something outside with her two children. They may have been carrying groceries into their house. At first glance I thought I knew who it was but as I looked more closely I wasn't sure. I debated whether or not to say anything now and decided against it. Then I thought about knocking on my next-door neighbor's door and chatting with her. to see if the employees resolved her problem, or problems."
"0994"	"(2005-01-05)"	"I am at a computer working on html coding, but I don't know if I'm at my home office or at the CAS office. I found two or three changes that needed to be made throughout the document I was working on and in different places in the lines of coding. I was thinking of ways to improve the effectiveness of how I accomplish this task in the future. to get it done in less time and to require fewer edits or corrections. I thought about getting a binder and printing out the pages of coding and putting them in page protectors. I realized this wasn't a good idea but that I could go ahead and get the binder and page protectors that I'd been thinking about ordering to put together a binder of all of my quick reference sheets. I thought it would be a good to use my quick reference sheet for editing with my html code and if I put this binder together it would might be easier for me to use that particular reference sheet."
"0995"	"(2005-01-09)"	"I was talking to someone about a woman who goes into the gym through the back entrance. intended for employees. No one ever questions her because of her physical condition. They assume she is an employee because she is in such good shape. I don't know why it would be considered sneaking in because going in the back simply meant you could get by without showing your membership card. I think a lot of members go in that door, including myself. In fact, the next time I went I entered through that door. I went into a back corner of the locker room and put my things into a locker. The locker room was kind of like a maze in that it had several aisles and some of them turned to enter other aisles and others were dead ends. Twice I turned from my locker to go out to the gym and found myself at a dead end. Another member, a man, noticed me do this and I said to him that I keep forgetting the way out. I pointed in the direction that I needed to go. I realized then that I was also in the men's section of the lockers so I got my things and moved them over to the women's lockers. Again, I went to a back corner. There was something(s) hanging over the locker I chose. Maybe a few hangers with shirts on them. I simply brushed them to the side far enough to get the locker open and put my things in. I decided to go out front and get a key for the locker. This was also something that a member would do on their honor if they came in the back entrance. something that other woman doesn't do. There's an image of her doing something but not in the typical gym setting. it's almost as though I'm seeing her perform some kind of acrobatics. maybe in the air. I'm noticing her physical shape and thinking that she is in good shape but I'm still not sure why people are, or would, make such a big deal about it. or mistake her for an employee. I went out to get a key for the locker. There is an employee standing at a podium at the entrance to the workout area. She asks to see my membership card and I tell her I forgot and left in my locker and that I'll go get it. As I turn to do that she stops me and I think she is going to get a key for me anyway but she is pushing things around on the podium looking for something in particular and doesn't seem able to find it. When I go back into the locker room I notice that there are a lot of people in there now, and it seems to be both genders. There is something set up now that I think are supposed to be massage tables, but they appear to be made of black steel legs and frames with natural-colored wicker making up the rest of the table. I think about whether or not I want to get a massage."
"0996"	"(2005-01-09)"	"I had filled one of my bird feeders with a feed that I thought was appropriate for one particular type of bird. There was some kind of problem with the feeder itself and Daddy was trying to help me fix it. Someone else is there as well. The rest of this is simply bizarre. It is a tube feeder that is less than 12 inches long and I have it in something that looks like a miniature duffel bag. barely longer than the feeder itself. Daddy has his face up against the feeder. and his face is smaller than the feeder itself. It's as though he is in the duffel bag also. I am pouring more seed into the duffel bag as he has his face against it. this is how we've decided to fix whatever the problem is. Then I decide that it might work better if we pull the bag closed a bit and tip it to one end. The other person with me helps me to do this. We seem to be covering Daddy's head and I hear him say that is working but that he can't breath so we quickly stop and move the seed away from his head and he gets away. Just at the time I get a nasty email from a bird telling me to stop giving them that poisonous, though that wasn't the word it used, birdseed. I thought, he doesn't know that I'm fixing it, because I didn't put the wrong seed in there intentionally to begin with. Then I have an image of a bunch of bird seed, like a long row that is piled up in the middle of the row. more than 12 inches long and about six inches wide. Most of it looks like the little, round, gold grain that seems to be one of the most common birdseeds, though I can't think what it's called right now. There are also seems to be a section of it that has something on top of it that looks like chocolate chips. I'm thinking about the chocolate chips. either about whether I've used them before or if they're safe for birds in general or if they're okay for this particular or it seems maybe even that this bird will be pleased when he sees the chocolate chips. Maybe even that when he sees the chocolate chips he won't be upset anymore or he'll know that I made a mistake the first time and he'll see that I was already trying to correct it."
"0997"	"(2005-01-09)"	"I was with Bill C. I was lying in a bed and in a room that was very dimly lit. He came in and lay down with me, lying on his back, but he moved very close to me. Our bodies were actually touching. We were both fully dressed. We were going to work on something or discuss business. I debated what to do, whether to move away, or whether to act like I didn't notice, or whether to think it wasn't a big deal. I was also wondering if he even noticed what he did or if he did, what, if anything, it meant. I decided not to move away, and not to worry about it if my movement made our bodies connect more. He turned over so his back was to me, in a spooning position, and backed up so that our bodies would be touching again. Now I was becoming a bit uncomfortable because I've always been very careful not to cross any lines with Bill C and he has never crossed any lines either. Because of our prior conversation(s) about coworkers hugging, I was surprised by this behavior. Part of me was comfortable with it, and possibly even enjoyed or welcomed it, yet part of me was very uncomfortable with it because he is my employer and he is married. Jane C was in another part of the office so I was especially surprised by his behavior when Jane C was in the office. This is, however, what made me feel that it was no big deal. I just knew that Bill C would not be unfaithful to Jane C. Still, I think I did back away once and he just backed up again so that our bodies were touching again. Now he is lying on his back again and we are discussing business. I lay my hand against his chest, maybe even without thinking. There isn't much light in the room. I change my position to either see him better while I'm talking to him, or to reach for something. My face comes very close to his. This happens more than once. Finally, he says something to me about it, about not worrying about our faces touching and he begins to kiss me. I want to stop because Jane C is in the other room, and because while the desire is certainly there, I still don't want to get involved with Bill C in this way. I then realize that Jane C is out of the office for a little while. We hear her come in. She is talking to us from the other room, knowing that we are in there together but not being suspicious at all of what we might be doing. I'm the first to start scrambling. I try to figure out where I can go before she sees me and wonders what is going on. There seems to be a closet or a storage room of some sort off the room where we were. I head in there. Jane C is still talking to us and as I'm in this other area Jane C walks into the room where Bill C and I were. She is still not suspicious at all. Now she comes into the room where I am to put something away. She is startled when she sees me there, but still not at all suspicious. I apologize for startling her and say that I went in there to get something. "
"0998"	"(2005-01-11)"	"I was at Bev's. There were a few movie videos that seem to be sitting on the floor. I comment about one that appears to be a three-video set. Someone tells me that they rented those for Rachel S. Rachel S may have been the one to tell me this. I notice it is of the same genre as Sleeping Beauty and Barbie. I asked her how many of them she has watched and she tells me that she has already watched them all. I was surprised that she had seen them all already. Then someone mentions that it is seven hours of video. I was also surprised by that. When someone tells me that Rachel S watched all seven hours in a row. without a break, I almost couldn't believe it. It just isn't like her parents to allow that type of thing. We talk about some other things. I going into another room and I open and close the door in a way to try to avoid Rudy, their dog. either coming in or going out of the room, but I'm not sure which. I prefer not to be in the same room as Rudy because he is so big and overwhelming to me. He likes to lick people and he slobbers a lot. I still have some fear of dogs, or at least have not gotten myself to be totally comfortable with them. We joke around a bit about my actions to avoid him but they tell me they have him in another room. as they usually do whenever they have guests. We also talk a little bit about other videos. Right after I left their house it occurs to me that it would have been nice of me to offer to return the videos back to the video rental store for them."
"0999"	"(2005-01-11)"	"I was working on a computer project. It seems to be some kind of Excel spreadsheet. But it is something for family and there is a sheet for each member of the family. I think it may have just been for one or two of my siblings families, but I'm not sure now. It felt like I woke up several times but each time I thought to myself that I wanted to finish up these sheets before I got up."
"1000"	"(2005-01-12)"	"I was trying to figure out what to buy Lilly H for a wedding gift. I saw her somewhere. I asked her if she was surprised that I wasn't at her reception and she said no. I felt like I needed to explain why I wasn't there but I was stumbling over my words trying to figure out what to say because I knew I didn't have a good reason. She thought it was because of what we have discussed in the past. that I simply don't leave my house enough when it means going somewhere alone. And that was a part of it. Then we talked about when we were going to get together again for brunch, and tried to find a date that would work for both of us and talked about where we want to go."
"1001"	"(2005-01-15)"	"I was doing html work. I don't know who it was for."
"1002"	"(2005-01-23)"	"I was at the CAS office. Bill C was sitting on the other side of my desk talking to me about something. He was leaning way over, with his arms or elbows resting on the desk. Apparently it had been a somewhat tense discussion, or we were discussing something we disagreed on. When he finished he held out his hand and said something like, What? No handshake? I shook his extended hand and then lightly patted, three times, the hand that was resting flat on the desk. He smiled and commented about the pat being an extra, meaning something I don't normally do. We are now lying side by side, he on his back and I on my left side facing him. I have my head resting on his shoulder and my right hand resting on his chest. Actually I keep moving my hand between his chest and stomach. He gets up and leaves for a few minutes and then comes back. Now I am lying to his left, on my right side, and place my left hand on his chest. He brings his head down a bit and gently kisses me. This isn't anything romantic. There was something about Jane, maybe we were at the office and she was in another room. Yet, us lying together in this way was perfectly fine - partially because it wasn't romantic and partially because it was a natural expression of some aspect of our relationship."
"1003"	"(2005-01-24)"	"I was working at the computer on a document similar to the CAS operations manual, but it wasn't for CAS. I was part of a team that was creating something personal for someone and this was my part of it. There are parts of it that remind of a TV program I watched last night where they were building a new home for a very sick girl. she could only come home if the house was as sterile and safe as a hospital. I was getting extremely frustrated however because there was one part of it that I couldn't get to work the way I wanted it to. I kept trying over and over and over. There was a male named Mikey. I have this sense that I had seen something on TV in the dream. and that's where I saw Mikey. I was trying to incorporate something about Mikey in this document I was creating because I thought it would make this girl smile or laugh. It's like I had created a hotlink in the document and I was trying to cut and paste it to a different page."
"1004"	"(2005-01-25)"	"I was working at the computer again, on some project for someone else. Seems like it might have been similar to some website work I do for CAS. I don't recall having any specific problems or anything unusual or significant about the work. "
"1005"	"(2005-01-27)"	"Laura D from Trading Spaces was at my house. I was showing her each room and talking about the different decorating things that I had done or was in the process of in each room."
"1006"	"(2005-01-28)"	"I was at the CAS office, though it looked very different than in waking life. The main room was a very large square room with at least one very large rectangular table. There was stuff all over it and there were several people there, none of whom I can identify. I was sitting there and noticing that there was something unusual about my computer armrest. I finally realized that it had somehow lost some of its beads. I thought it probably had just gotten torn and some of the beads had fallen out. I went into another much smaller room for something and came back out. Now the armrest was even smaller, in fact, it looked like it had been chewed apart and only about 1/5 of the material was still left and the one edge of the fabric was all torn and ragged. It was at this point that I realized there were either rats or mice in the office and they had done this. I realized that I needed to get rid of any food in the office. I was thinking probably about the packages of crackers that I keep in the one cabinet for me to occasionally snack on or have with soup when I work late. I didn't know why they would be a problem since they were tightly packaged, but it was the first thing I thought of. I went back into the other room where that cabinet was and there was stuff sitting everywhere. It was as though there were boxes of stuff piled on the floor, up to my shoulders. But either on top of the boxes or maybe in some open boxes there was also food. It was different kinds of chips, like potato chips, corn chips, and several different kinds of tortilla chips. I tried one of each to see what they were. I was telling someone else what it was as I tried each one. One of the tortilla chips had some kind of bits in them that were lavender. That was the one I really liked. I went back out to the large room and I saw a bunch of mice or rats under the table there were probably six or more. I stood on a chair because I didn't want them getting close to me or running across my feet. There was someone else there and we were saying something about them."
"1007"	"(2005-01-28)"	"I was doing html work on a web page for CAS. My alarm went off while I was working on a bulleted list. When it went off I thought I would just hit the snooze button while I work on the list a little more. Each time the alarm went off I thought the same thing and would reach over and hit the snooze button again. Finally, I decided I was close enough to done that I would just turn that alarm off and keep working until the other alarm in my room went off, that would probably give me enough time to finish."
"1008"	"(2005-01-29)"	"I was working at the computer on the CAS operations manual."
"1009"	"(2005-01-30)"	"I was editing and updating CAS web pages, text pages, registration pages, and thank you pages. This is similar to what I do before the e-news goes out, yet it didn't seem to be related to that. I kept going back and forth between the different pages. Like making a change on one page would remind of a change that needed to be made on another."
"1010"	"(2005-02-01)"	"I went to my birth home for Halloween. There were a lot of us that were going Trick or Treating. I arrived in costume. Most of the others were in costume as well. Two of Uncle P's sons were there to go with us, but they weren't going to wear costumes. At the last minute I decided not to go. I and someone else, maybe Macy F, helped Brian F with his costume. It seems that it was some kind of a bug. It was shaped like an M & M, red, very soft and fluffy like a pillow, but it had four long thin cords sewn on at the left side of his body and after he put the costume on these cords had to be taken across the front of his body and attached on the right side. They weren't tight across the front at all. It was more like they formed a bit of an arch, yet there was nothing in them that should have allowed them to hold an arch shape. Also, they weren't supposed to be attached in the same order on the right side as on the left. So we were trying to figure out where each one got attached and keep them untangled etc. There was something like a button on the end of each one and that button went into a hole in the fabric that looked like someone had just cut or torn a tiny hole in the fabric. It wasn't an actual buttonhole. Just a few minutes after two people came back in to get something from one of the bedrooms. They were talking excitedly about how much candy they had gotten already. They each said they had over 100 pieces already. The front door was open and I heard someone just outside of it talking about something in the living room. As I went out there to see what was going on I noticed that one of them was just getting ready to throw something at a candle we had lit. It was like a votive candle in a clear glass candleholder, similar to mine on my altar. As he was getting ready to throw it someone with him said, Go ahead. Take your best shot. I wasn't in time to prevent what he threw from hitting the candle but I did catch it as it started to fall and prevented it from hitting the floor or starting a fire. As I caught it I looked at them. I don't know if they were children or adults. or even real people, though I assumed they were children in costume. The face of the one was very close to the floor and had a head similar to what you see depicted in movies as an alien. It was oversized, with no hair. As I looked at him he turned his head almost completely sideways, gave me a very odd look and then seemed to disappear. One of the people with him, the size of an adolescent, had turned and walked away as soon as I had come into sight. The third, also the size of an adolescent, just stood there looking at me. He was also in costume. It wasn't an alien costume but something intended to be frightening. I decided to go out with my family members who had returned to get something. I asked where the bags were but as I asked I saw them in a box. They were brown paper grocery sacks. That's what we were using for Trick-or-Treating."
"1011"	"(2005-02-02)"	"I was working on an Excel spreadsheet that seemed to be divided into three sections. I used the spreadsheet to work with internet urls and they had something to do with the TV program American Idol. I was working with producers and/or the host of the program. It seems that each url had a question associated with it and they were being used somehow with or by the participants in the competition. We were testing them. but not by clicking on the urls. We may have been asking some of the questions. And we were doing an overall evaluation of what we had so far. Was it too many? Were they the right ones? Were people able to use them and understand? Some involvement by or with the competitors helped us to see that there were too many and that some were not clear. So we began editing and deciding which ones to eliminate and which ones needed to be changed for clarification. We began making changes to some of the questions and eliminating some of them. At this point I think maybe at least one of the judges, Simon, became involved. There was discussion about a favorite charity of each of the judges. Simon had started a charity called Hard Hats for Kids. I thought it was such a great name. It fit the charity so well. It was metaphorical but I can't remember what it was a metaphor for. I may have been awake at this point, but I'm not sure, as I tried to figure out the metaphor. The main one I remember is thinking that it had something to do with children building their future. There were few images besides the boxes of the spreadsheet and the text in those boxes. There is a very distant, unclear image of the program host."
"1012"	"(2005-02-03)"	"My first morning alarm was going off and I kept reaching out and hitting the snooze button. I was working on something that involved five-minute increments. Each time the alarm went off I would hit the snooze thinking that I needed to anyway because it would remind me that the next five-minute increment was over. I was becoming extremely irritable with this whole process, and especially with the alarm going off but I thought I was nearly finished so I thought I would just try to stick it out. I finally woke up enough to realize what was going on and I turned the alarm off."
"1013"	"(2005-02-04)"	"I had the text from the back cover of Bill C's book pasted in an Excel sheet to do some type of work with it. As I was doing whatever it was, I realized that we could use this text in other ways. So I was trying to figure out the best way to do that. I kept cutting and pasting the text into different cells of the Excel sheet to find the best placement. There seemed to be a vertical bar of color along the left side of the text. Sometimes when I placed the text that vertical bar of color seemed to change or disappear completely. I debated whether that was okay or not. I think I ended up not using it in other ways at all."
"1014"	"(2005-02-05)"	"I was working on email newsletter mailing lists for CAS. I had the standard three but there were two new ones that I was creating. I was going back and forth, in my head and on the computer screen, about the advantages of each list, how best to utilize each one, and the best way to set them up."
"1015"	"(2005-02-07)"	"I was working with Excel sheets again. I don't remember what was on them or who they were for. I was thinking that it was okay that I was working with Excel sheets again because it was a good reason and it was a project that wasn't going to take long. like an hour or less."
"1016"	"(2005-02-08)"	"Again with the Excel sheets. and American Idol. This time, however, I can't say that I was specifically involved. It doesn't even necessarily feel that I was. The images I have are of the Excel sheets and the Idol judges. There are several columns set up for criteria for judging the contestants and several rows of information for each contestant. One section of the sheet was highlighted in pale green."
"1017"	"(2005-02-09)"	"I went with Matthew for a campus visit to SMW. Although, I'm not sure we were even on campus because it looked much different than waking life. It looked more like we were on a business district street in a small town, and the street was lined with buildings. Each doorway was a different part of the school. I'm not sure if each one was a different area of study, or each one a professor, or something else yet. There were tons of people there, mostly female as SMW is primarily a female college. I was thinking about this and somewhat surprised that Matthew would want to attend a female college, because the men who were enrolled here were working on their masters in Theology. Somehow I came to realize that there were now a small number of young men enrolled in a bachelor degree program there. I don't know if I knew that because I saw a few there that day, or if Matthew said it or maybe someone else said that to me or maybe it was just a remembering in the dream. Matthew seemed to be very interested in the school. He was having a lot of fun there. We were both having a lot of fun. In some place there were people who worked for the school sitting outside of some of the entrances. They were sitting at small tables to greet or answer questions. One woman said something to me about my attitude and energy. something to the effect of how good it is for Matthew to have a Mom who is such fun. I said, but this place is a lot of fun. We went into this room that was some kind of a huge congregating area. In some parts of the room there were large round tables with chairs all around them. In other parts of the room there were sitting areas with sofas and more comfortable chairs. Some of the round tables were occupied by professors and employees of the school. As we were walking through I turned my head a couple of times to look at two of these tables. I'm not sure if I turned because I recognized someone at one of those tables, because I just thought I did, or to see if someone I knew was sitting there. As I did this I lost Matthew. He didn't realize that I was no longer right behind him and he had gotten a bit ahead of me. As I continued a man from one of those tables I had kept looking at stood up and called out to me, asking where Matthew was. I realized that he wanted to talk with him. I think he had already been planning to talk with him. I pointed ahead of me as I said that he was just up ahead of me, but I kept walking. Matthew had stopped to talk with someone else so I caught up with him quickly. He saw me and headed towards me as the man who had spoken to me came up behind me."
"1018"	"(2005-02-11)"	"Matthew and a lot of his friends were at a social event, male and female. I went for some reason other than to attend the event. Lindsey H and Chris H are the two people there that I knew. Lindsey H said a couple of things to me that I found very odd, because they almost sounded flirtatious, as though he had a romantic interest in me, which is preposterous. But then someone else said something to me about him having a romantic interest in me. I didn't know what to do with that. I certainly didn't want to encourage it. I've always really liked Lindsey H. the way any mother really likes a friend of their child. They are having a party around a swimming pool. It's as though I'm in the background observing. I see them drinking. maybe take shots of something. then jumping into the pool. They know the water is going to be really cold so they let out a yell before they jump in. There are four or five jumping in at once. feet first. I'm disappointed to see them drinking, especially Lindsey H, and especially the ones that seem to be drinking too much. I'm talking to someone, I think, about how much I enjoy watching young people grow as people and mature through the high school and college years."
"1019"	"(2005-02-11)"	"There is an older woman, overweight, with long black hair, driving a car. She is stopped. either has already stopped for a reason or been stopped for some reason. She has her trunk open and takes a small box out of it. The things in the box appear to be something that you might use to repair a car. One piece looks like the connector piece of jumper cables. There is something on it though and the person with her looking at it thinks it is evidence that she killed someone. a relative. I'm watching the dream scene while listening to a conversation that is going on away from the scene. The scene is this woman driving, either on city streets or highways. It is dusk or dark because I notice the street or city lights. The conversation is about this woman the person she killed. They suspect her of killing one of her relatives. From what they saw in her trunk they are positive it was her. She is trying to justify it by saying how much he annoyed or irritated or bothered her. She was trying to make it seem that the murder was warranted."
"1020"	"(2005-02-12)"	"I was working a computer but there were other people with me. We were recording things in kind of a list fashion. It was questions or things for consideration. There were many changes being made in the town and decisions needed to be made about what changes. It was very similar to the TV program Town Haul. They were renovating many of the old buildings in the town. But there was a limit to how much they could do or how many of the buildings they could renovate. Everyone would mention the buildings they thought should be considered. Then they would name the reasons why the various buildings should be considered. I was typing the items into a text box. After they felt they had completed the list they would try to prioritize and make the final decision about which ones would be renovated. But the items in the text box seemed to be more than just those reasons why a particular building should be considered. For example, someone had me add something about a black Terrier. It feels to me that the Terrier had been in ill-health. This made one of the buildings in town seem more of a priority to the people in the town. At one point in the document there was a second text box. either on top of or inside the other. The second one was very, very wide. Maybe I had not set it for word wrap. But that should not have needed to be done. I did change the setting to word wrap and now the second text box was the same width as the first."
"1021"	"(2005-02-13)"	"Kim H had asked me to do quite a few things on the morning of her wedding. The wedding was to begin at 10:00 am. One of the things that came up last minute that she asked me to do was to call the florist before they left to come to the church and ask them to bring something else with them, but I don't remember what it was. Chris A was going to be arriving at the very last minute so she had also asked me to do what I could beforehand so he could get ready very quickly. I was in a very large open room. I don't see anything in it. Yet, I picked up a bottle of body wash and put some into a sink. As I did so I also closed up the sink drain and allowed hot water to fill the sink. I had a new shower sponge with me. I tore off the tags and laid it by the sink. Next I laid out all the pieces of his tux on something. Just as I was finishing Chris A walked in. He was dressed in what would be usual attire for him. jeans, boots, plaid shirt over a t-shirt, cowboy hat. But he was much taller and much thinner than in waking life. I didn't even take time to give him a hug but as I walked away I half-turned around towards him. I pointed to where his things were as I mentioned the sink of water that I had prepared in case he needed or wanted to wash up. He said he had taken a shower before he came. I think he said at a truck stop. I was in such a hurry because I realized the wedding was supposed to start in 5 minutes and I was not dressed yet. I knew Kim H would be very upset with me but also didn't feel that there was anything I could have done differently to have been able to get dressed earlier. Somebody was talking to Kim H in another room trying to assure her that everybody would be ready on time, though I don't think she was upset with Chris H or worried about him being ready on time."
"1022"	"(2005-02-14)"	"I was doing computer work for someone, but I can't say for sure if it was CAS. It seemed to either be work on, or related to, an eNewsletter. Everything I did, I had to do in two places. I don't know if it was because there were two very similar things or that it was one thing documented in two places. I was also pointing out to someone that I had set up the project so that when you changed some things it the software would automatically make some other changes. This significantly reduced the amount of time it took to complete the eNewsletter each time it was being published."
"1023"	"(2005-02-15)"	"I was working on a document on the computer. I was trying to pull together a lot of information into one document and add to it in a way that would accomplish what we wanted to accomplish in an easy to understand way. I was working with someone but I don't know who it was, and I have a sense that it was more than one person. I don't think the work was CAS related. I was also using highlighting in the document on the pieces of information that I was adding. The statements that I was adding including both a number and a percentage relative to what we were talking about. I had entered several and before I realized that it wasn't quite accurate or that it was misleading. I changed it and thought it was better but I still wasn't happy with it."
"1024"	"(2005-02-16)"	"There was a competition going on and I was doing some kind of computer work related to it. I was using an Excel spreadsheet, but it seems like I was only using one column. Each cell had a few sentences of text in it. I was editing the text in each cell to see if it could be cut down but also having it word-wrap and adjusting the alignment of the text in the cell."
"1025"	"(2005-02-16)"	"I learned that Bill C is not nearly as pleased with Bryan N's performance at CAS as I thought. I either wondered or had a strong impression that Bryan N might not be there much longer. I immediately thought that I could not let myself feel happy about this in any way. that such thoughts or feelings would be totally inappropriate and not Christian-like. Besides, I do still think that Bryan N is the closest I've seen to someone who could actually get on-going results for the company in terms of revenue, as long as he stays focused on that."
"1026"	"(2005-02-16)"	"My radio alarm was going off. As I was listening to it play I was also working with or viewing the files I was receiving via the radio. There were different types of files. Some of them were images. I was looking at the different types of files. There was something specific about the image files that I was looking at, that included what extension they had. if they were tif's, jpg's or something else. The files were related to some kind of event and I had an agenda for the event. The files somehow correlated to the different segments of the agenda. I was moving the files around to make sure they were each associated with the right segment of the agenda. I think, at least at one point, I was talking to someone else. The time on one segment of the agenda said it began at 6:30. I suggested we change that to 6:45 because we would need to allow time for a change in the room setup before that segment. I wondered what we would do with everyone for that 15 minutes, where we would send them while the room setup was changed. I thought that people had done something similar for weddings and just sent everyone into a large hallway for that time and had refreshments out there for them while they waited. I realized I was going to need all these files on my computer and wondered how I was going to be able to transfer them from the radio to the computer. At first I didn't think it could be done but then I realized that it could. and how it could. So I relaxed and kept working."

"1028"	"(2005-02-24)"	"I had two small table lamps in my bedroom. They had dark-colored shades on them. I replaced the dark shades with white or very light-colored ones. I was surprised at how much it brightened the room and I wondered why I hadn't thought about doing that before."
"1029"	"(2005-02-25)"	"Bill C hired a bunch of new consultants. Bryan N no longer worked there. Bill C had hired another man older than Bryan N but younger than us, who was going to be working out of Bryan N's office and managing all of the new consultants. There was a young blonde woman in my office and there were 2 or 3 other people working out of an office in the back. Where the door to the supply closet is in waking life was the door to a large room where we had set up quite a few workstations. All of the new consultants were going to be working out of this office. There were two young women with black hair and one young black man. There was another woman there who was helping us with the physical aspect of getting everyone set up. It was Amy Wynne from the TV program Trading Spaces. There was a computer in the back work area that was supposed to be mine. One of the dark-haired new girls was working at it, viewing a video. It didn't look like a typical computer tower. It was sitting on top of a table and from what would be the front of the tower the computer was very recessed from the shell and it looked very dark inside the recess. I could see that the employee had inserted a VHS tape into the front of the computer for viewing. I said something about this not being my computer. Amy said the new girl had my computer at her workstation that it didn't matter which one I had. I was emphatic that it did, stating that I had certain software on my hard drive that none of the others did and I needed my own computer back. So she started making the switch. About that time Bill C walked up and I said that I didn't have an office. He asked why and I told him that one of the new people was in there. He said he would talk to the new sales manager and have him take care of it. I went in to see him and he got up immediately and started getting the new person out of my office so I could get back in there. I went to the back work area again and the two dark-haired girls were doing something at that computer. One of them said something about a Goddess. I said, Oh. That's fun. Someone I can talk to about Goddesses and things. Later I was thinking about how Bill C would react to that statement so I was thinking about how I could truthfully explain it to him so it would still be okay. My explanation went something like this. I believe in God and that God exists in each of us. I know that some people refer to God as Goddess. "
"1030"	"(2005-02-27)"	"I was getting very upset because I kept shutting off my alarm but it kept going off. At the same time I was working at the computer and I kept saving these files but then couldn't open them. I finally realized that I needed to save them with a different extension, I think a pdf extension, and that would solve my problem."
"1031"	"(2005-02-27)"	"I had a bunch of emails. Each one contained an interview with a star from the Academy Awards. They were all saved with the same name so I had no idea what was in each one. I was becoming very frustrated or agitated by this. I finally started opening and renaming them one by one and felt better."
"1032"	"(2005-03-09)"	"I was at an event or something like that and went into the public restroom. There were two stalls. I went into the one furthest from the door and proceeded to use the toilet. Someone else came in and started to come into my stall when I realized that the door to my stall had not shut completely. We both were standing there trying to figure out why the doors would not shut or how to shut them so they would stay shut. The doors were much shorter than is typical in waking life. The closures were on the outside of the door so the only way you could use them is if you could reach over the top of the door and down far enough to the closure. A third woman came in and was helping us try to figure this out. Now the doors seemed as tall as in waking life and the third woman noticed a closure on the top of the door. At one point that closure was on the outside then it seemed to be on the inside. I went into the other stall and was going to use it then. The second woman said something about still being hesitant. I said I didn't care that I had to go bad enough that I was just going to use it. I noticed that the toilet was kind of nasty and that it had not been flushed by at least one person who used it previously. I debated for just a second whether or not to flush it before I used it, which is what I would typically do. I was concerned about the impression that would give these other two women so I decided against it. As I sat down I was concerned that I would not be able to go with these other two women in there, as is often the case for me. But I had to go bad enough that it turned out I didn't have a problem at all. "
"1033"	"(2005-03-01)"	"I was working at the computer and creating three different things. I don't know if they were documents or spreadsheets. I don't know if I already had the information or if I was thinking of it and then deciding which spreadsheet or document it would go into or where it belonged. It may have just been three different sections of one project or one document or spreadsheet. Part of this information involved weblinks. Part of it was informational and partly questions. The whole point of the questions was to get them to come up with answers that would compel people to take a certain action. I actually think I started out with just two documents or sections and then I had an idea for a third that I thought would be very useful in helping us to get people to take whatever action it was. I don't even know if it was CAS work or something else."
"1034"	"(2005-03-06)"	"Jen and Jerry from the TV program The Bachelorette are visiting. It is my house but it doesn't look anything like my waking life home. The trainer shows up. Jen's trainer. They are going to go play softball. I ask if I can go too. The trainer seemed a little reluctant. She said, Yes. But you have to really want to win. I said, Oh, I definitely really want to win. I've played on a league for a number of years Matthew is there and said something about how good I was. that I was sixth in the league for RBI's maybe. The trainer, her name was Jilly, said, In the league? Matthew said yes. They were impressed by that. I was rushing around trying to find my bat and glove. I went to one wall in the house and told them that they were in that closet. But the wall is wallpapered. I'm looking for the seam because I know there is no handle on this closet. But I can't find the seam. I finally remember that I wallpapered over it because I knew I hardly ever use the stuff in that closet. I finally climbed up on a table and I grabbed a corner of the wallpaper. It's an adhesive more like a sticker than the typical wallpaper adhesive. I just started pulling it off and it comes off in one large sheet. I finally get to the closets and I open it up. It's full of Christmas decorations. On the top shelf there is a bowl with some chocolate candy. The bowl moves a bit and the candy starts falling out. I ask the others if they want a piece of candy. The candy is foil-wrapped, coin-shaped chocolate. I was getting frustrated because I know they are waiting for me and I can't find my bat and glove. I finally tell them to go ahead without me because I don't want to hold them up. Then I think Jilly tells Matthew where they are going so if I find it we can meet them there if we want to. Now I'm in a room that's an office, like a home study. There's a TV in there. Jen wants to watch TV. It's a very large TV. I'm scrounging around trying to find the remote. I made a comment about how things are never that messy and I usually know right where the remote is. Then I remember that it's in the magazine rack. I go over there and find it and hand it to her. I look for the channel guide. As I look at it, it's a mess. It's outdated and torn. I think that probably wouldn't matter to her anyway. Now we're in another room and Jen said something to me about not seeming to be in a hurry or anything. I ask her why I should be. She said we were supposed to be leaving for dinner in a half-hour. I said, WHAT? I was so surprised because I either didn't know about it or I had totally forgotten about it. She said that Jerry was in the shower now. About that time he comes out and he didn't have any clothes on or a towel wrapped around him. He had his boxers in his hand and was getting ready to put them on but he walked by two or three times. Then one of the young boys walked by and he had no clothes on and then I saw Matthew walk by with no clothes on. I thought, What is this? Everyone walking around here with no clothes on. Then Jen came by. She had her panties on but no bra. She was putting on her bra as she walked by me. I just thought to myself, I'm certainly not going to do that. Now I'm pretty upset and angry that no one told me and that I'm just now able to get in the shower. I went over to this wall. It looks like a wall of closets and the doors are on sliders. But they are flat wood panels. I'm moving the panels and moving the clothes and thinking to myself, I know the shower is here somewhere. I then go into another room. I think I just decided not to shower because at that point I only have fifteen minutes left. So I went to the bathroom. There were also one or two small children here but I don't know whose children they were. One of them seems to be Andrew S except that he has really short blonde hair. Anyway, I went to use the bathroom and whoever had used it last had not flushed. They had also thrown a towel over the edge of the toilet bowl so it was partially hanging in the water in the toilet bowl. Then one of the boys had put a handful of rubber spiders in there. I just decided to use it anyway and just flush the rubber spiders because whoever had used it before hadn't flushed either and I certainly wasn't going to reach in there to get those spiders out. And the towel, I just pulled out far enough to pull it up over the toilet seat so it wasn't in the water. Then I realized that the seat was all nasty. I grabbed a bunch of toilet paper and I was going to wipe the seat off. Jen and Jerry were having a disagreement or argument. She was upset because his boss had called him and apparently he couldn't stay as long to visit as they had planned or hoped. He had to go back to work. It doesn't seem that he was going to be gone that long, but maybe just for a day or two and then he was going to come back. But she was very upset by that. I understood her disappointment, but I also thought that when you find something really good in terms of a relationship you do the hard stuff to make it work and to be able to have that relationship."
"1035"	"(2005-03-06)"	"I was in a house with Bill C. He walks by me and opens up a large round container. It's the kind that you would get cookies in at the bakery in the grocery store. Very flimsy, clear plastic, but it's the size of a platter and maybe only an inch deep. It's about half full of fudge. He asked me if I wanted some. I said, No. thank you. He said he thought I liked it. I said I did and that it was very good, that I had tried one piece. He said he didn't. I said, What do you mean you don't like it? I thought you said you did? I thought your mom made it. He said she did."

"1037"	"(2005-03-08)"	"I had gone to the doctor for some flu like symptoms. I was standing back in the nurse's area when I man came from another area. He was wearing greenish-blue scrubs. Doctor Pf wasn't available so I was going to be seeing Doctor Waddle [unknown in waking life] . I assumed this man was Doctor Waddle but his first name was Steve. I said, Hi Steve. As soon as I did I thought, That's odd. Why would I call him Steve and I had never met him before and he's a doctor. That's not like me to call someone in his position by their first name unless they ask me to do so. He just smiled and nodded his head up and down once as he walked by. Several of the nurses were taking care of things they needed to take care. While I'm waiting, I'm sitting on a small table. I got off and wondered why they were having me sit on that thing. I'm talking to another man. It turns out that he is Doctor Waddel. He is talking to me about my symptoms. Doctor Pf comes out while I'm still talking to Doctor Waddell. He gets some files. I didn't see him until he started to walk away and I thought to myself that it looked like Doctor Pf. I think he came out one other time also. Both times Doctor Waddell stopped talking to me long enough to say something to Doctor Pf. They exchanged a few words. When I was talking to Doctor Waddell I told him that I had been struggling with these symptoms all winter this year since I wasn't able to get my flu shot. One of them is saying that she is going to be the first one to get the myoclonus shot. She has a very small, maybe two-three inch long, and maybe 1/8 to _ inch in diameter, white plastic thing that has the shot serum in it. There is another doctor sitting there by a little counter and someone pulls out the needle that is going in this little plastic vial. The needle is about three feet long. It looks like white plastic filament. One end goes into the vial and the other end, of course, into the body. The whole thing has to be inserted into the body. I am aghast at the length of this needle and thinking about whether it's going to hurt or whatever. Then they tell me that I need to have this shot. I'm thinking that there is no way. I'm wondering where they insert me. I hear them talking about there being two or three different options of where they can insert it. One of them is to insert it rectally. Maybe they said that was the easiest way. I thought that sounded awful. Then they tell me that I have to have one but I have to insert it myself. I have to insert it in the base of the back of my head. That sounds even scarier to me because that sounds dangerous. I'm wondering how I'm going to do this myself. I'm worried if it's going to hurt but also if I might do some kind of harm to brain. One of the nurses makes a small incision but they don't have it ready for me to use yet. A little bit drips onto the floor so I'm holding one of my fingers over the opening they made, waiting for them to get this thing ready for me. I'm still very nervous because I don't know what I'm doing. Then I hear one of them tell me not to worry because they're going to have me lay on this table over here in the kitchen. They took me into another small room. It wasn't really a kitchen and I thought it was odd that they would call it a kitchen. It's kind of weird that they would call it a kitchen. I also don't see a table or where they are going to have me lay to do this. Then they ask me to get on a scale so they can weigh me. The nurse who weighs me I hadn't seen in a long time. She comments about how much weight I've lost. I told her that over the last three years I've lost thirty plus pounds. We're chatting about that a little bit. I said it's very nice when people notice and say something because that gives me a little incentive to lose the next thirty. I said my boss has been particularly good about noticing and saying something quite often. Someone said they were going to have to make the incision in the back of my head a little larger for me to give myself this shot. Someone brings out this thing that reminds me of a shoebox-size plastic storage container. It has this thing in it that is about six-inches in diameter. It is a medical model of some kind of vein or something in the body. To me it is very looking and looks very real. It has all kinds of muscle and blood. It looks like a body organ but it is long and rope-like. It isn't real and isn't really bloody because it is just a model. It has something to do with this shot and whatever it is that I'm going to be doing."
"1038"	"(2005-03-10)"	"I was working in SF and getting very frustrated because I kept finding so many mistakes. I finally figured out what was causing all the problems. I think at that point I either finished up the work quickly and easily or I realized it was going to be quick and easy now to fix."
"1039"	"(2005-03-10)"	"I was in California for the SAID conference. I must have been there a day early because I was doing things on my own. I wasn't attending any events or anything. I don't even know if I was at the right hotel. I was in the hotel in the restaurant. All of the tables were set for the diners and each place setting had cups or bowls that were filled with large chunks of mixed fruit. The seats were assigned to the various hotel guests. My table was set for four people but I was there alone. I had not gone to eat yet but at one point I went to the table but didn't even sit down. I picked a couple of chunks of fruit out with my fingers and ate them. I also had a beef stick. I had taken a couple of bites of it and then I stuck it in my fruit cup, intending to come back and have more. When I came back it was gone. One of the hotel workers had come and taken it. Somehow Bryan N had ended up with this beef stick and he had taken it and was going to talk to Bill C about it. I got really upset when I found out about this. I thought, what in the heck difference does it make to him? What business is it of his or anyone else for that matter what I eat? I think I had asked one of the restaurant employees what had happened to it and she told me. She also said something to me about eating those beef sticks. I said that it's just a quick and easy way of getting protein. Still, I was thinking that it was really no one's business whether or not I eat those, or whatever I eat for that matter. I was thinking that since we weren't going to be having the class reunion in San Francisco anymore and I was at a reasonably priced or inexpensive hotel, like an EconoLodge, I decided to check with them and see if my room was available for me to extend my stay. Then I could spend some time on the beach and such after conference. I had gone to the checkout desk and when I went in it was almost like you were outdoors. The desk was behind a glass partition with a cutout where you reached in with the paperwork and your payment. It was intended to be very secure. They must have been changing shifts because there were three or four employees there but one was coming out, one or two were counting money in a cash drawer. There was another guest standing there waiting as well that was ahead of me. I decided to come back a little bit later. When I went back the check-in and checkout was in a different area. They were two separate counters each facing opposite directions. One was for checkout and one for check-in. They each had a separate door on one end to get into them and a separate door to each on the other end to get out of them. I was standing inside the door by the checkout counter because I was already checked-in. I was standing there waiting because the employee was helping someone else. There seemed to be maybe 10-20 feet between the two counters. There was also an employee at the check-in counter but they were helping another guest as well. I finally did get a chance to ask if they had any rooms. As I was waiting I was trying to recall what the actual dates were that I wanted to extend my stay. I decided it was the 28th and that I would be checking out on the 1st. Finally, when I had a chance, I asked and found out that they were booked and I wouldn't be able to extend my stay there. I left. I walked to another hotel that was close by to see if they would have a room those nights. They didn't either. I asked them if they could recommend someplace else close by and she just shook her head no. I think I walked back to my own hotel. I was still outside. I heard a group of women out there talking. One of them was standing a distance from the others and was holding up a little garment that was a very small dress that looked more like it was just a top. Her friends were laughing because it was so small and short. They were saying, No. No. Absolutely not. There's no way that's a dress. There's no way I would wear that. Then someone else held another dress up and it was closer to knee length. They said, Yes. Maybe that. That might be more appropriate. I thought it might be fun to go do a little shopping but then I realized that I hadn't been to the beach yet and that I should do that now before conference starts. I should go spend the afternoon at the beach."

I'm cutting and pasting groups of numbers from one column into another, but not always the bottom. Sometimes I'm inserting them into the middle of a column of existing numbers. I'm getting frustrated trying to make it work. whatever it is that I'm trying to do. It almost looks like a card game like Solitaire or Free Cell. It looks like that kind of numbers and it almost as though I'm trying to put them in order like you would if you were playing one of those games. "

"1043"	"(2005-03-15)"	"The crew was working on a car and I was at a computer trying to find information that would help them. I seem to have an Excel sheet with columns of information. not numbers but text. Some of the cells were hyperlinks so I would click on them, read what I found and decide if it was useful. If it was I would cut and paste it into a document and give it to the crew. If it wasn't I deleted it. I was also moving some things around on the Excel sheet to a different place in the column it was in or to a different column. I don't know what that was about."
"1044"	"(2005-03-17)"	"I am in a small room that looks somewhat like a sun porch. It seems to have at least two walls that are almost solid windows. They each had some type of blinds on them. I had gone around and pulled up the blinds on all of the windows on at least one wall to let in the light. It seems to be a bright, sun-shiny day outside. I can't recall there being furniture in the room, but there is someone else in the room and some people who walked by the adjoining room. I don't know if I know them, or they know me, but they know someone else in here. They say something about someone else in the room, or a house or an office. The people on the outside are saying that they feel sorry for the other people inside because they thought some man was responsible for opening all of the blinds and letting all the light in and they thought that was inconsiderate of the others in there. that they didn't have a choice or that they had to tolerate all this light, when for whatever reason they wouldn't want to. The people on the outside seemed to assume that most people would not want this. So, they thought it was rude that this man was opening all of these blinds. I recognize that they were blaming him wrongfully. I don't know if I had an opportunity to tell them that it wasn't him but me. I was thinking that I needed to do that, that I didn't want them to blame him when I was the one that opened the blinds."
"1045"	"(2005-03-17)"	"I feel like I'm at the CAS office though it doesn't look like it. There are other people there. In the dream I know them but I don't know them in waking life. We're in one specific room. The large room doesn't have much furniture in it. Along the one wall there's a pipe running along the wall close to the floor. It's very small, maybe an inch in diameter. I see some man crouched down by this pipe. I walk up to him and ask him what's going on. He points out a leak and that there's water all over the floor. He's trying to figure out where it's coming from and stop the leak. I come back a little bit later and he is still there and the water is still leaking out. I ask him how he's progressing. He points further up the wall toward the ceiling. I notice that there is water sheeting down this wall. He points out that the water is coming from someplace higher and it's really a large leak now. The water is just flowing out, sheeting down the wall and onto the floor. As much as it is flowing out you would expect it to be flooding the floor. But it is running onto the floor, running across the room but it is not spreading out to any of the walls. It's almost as though it is self-contained in a center portion of the floor. We finally figure out that we have to stop the leak someplace other than where we are right now. We realize that we first have to identify this certain spot and then we can stop the leak. I think it is related to a refrigerator but I don't know why I think that. In the meantime I'm wondering if there is a way that we can catch this water so it's not just accumulating in this puddle on the floor. If it was the other pipe we might be able to leverage the pipe up far enough to get some kind of a container under it that we could empty frequently. At least that way the water wouldn't be going all over the floor and causing a hazardous situation. It's dangerous for people walking through this room. But since the water is coming out someplace else and sheeting down the wall I can't figure out a way that we can capture it. Bill C shows up. He had been out all day and shows up unexpectedly. I'm sitting in a chair and he walks up behind me. I'm wearing some kind of a sleeveless top. He puts his hands on my shoulders and kind of rests his left arm so it is against my left cheek, not just brushing it but solidly against my cheek. I think I actually rest my head against it. We're both fine with that. It's not like either of us is conscious of it or thinking that it's okay, but rather that it's just a very natural thing and expected or accepted. We're talking to this other man in the room and what's been going on while Bill C has been gone and about the water and such. While we're talking Bill C is using his thumbs to massage the back of my shoulders. As he does that his thumbs seem to naturally go under my top a bit and I feel them touching my bra straps. I feel a little embarrassed but then realize that he doesn't think anything of it. He goes on to say that we might as well go ahead and move. We start moving into another office. I guess we're changing our office location. We're going to start moving everything out. I'm thinking that we need to be very careful because of the water on the floor. It's dangerous in any situation, even when people are just walking through. But, if we're busy moving things and we have things in our hands it's going to be harder to watch where we're stepping and keep our balance if we slip and such. I'm just thinking this is very dangerous and we're going to have to be very careful. Though, I understand this water leak is a reason to go ahead and move. I decide to change clothes into some older, more comfortable clothes if I'm going to be carrying boxes and stuff. Everyone else I think is already in their casual clothes. I thought I was going home to change. Maybe I went home and got some other clothes and came back. But I'm changing clothes and Bill C walks up again. I'm in my underwear. I'm wearing a black bra and black panties. Bill C walks up and starts talking to me. It doesn't even seem to phase him that I'm in my underwear and getting dressed. I feel embarrassed and I'm trying to hurry and get my clothes on. In the meantime I'm bending forward as I'm trying to pull my top on in an effort to partially cover myself. I don't know how. I couldn't. He just keeps talking and doesn't even seem to care or doesn't even notice that I'm in my underwear. just no big deal to him, acting like it's perfectly normal."
"1046"	"(2005-03-18)"	"Deven D decided he was no longer going to chair my committee. I don't remember how I found this out but it wasn't from him. I was told a reason, maybe more than one, why he made this decision but none of them made sense to me. I was concerned that he made the decision because he was disappointed in me and he didn't feel that I was focusing enough of my efforts or thinking process on spiritual intelligence and because I'm not being diligent enough. not spending enough time on it each week. I was extremely upset about this whole situation. The school randomly appointed someone to replace him. It was a woman. I think her name was Rachel [unknown in waking life] and she lived in Washington D.C. She just showed up at my house one day. I had some friends at my home when she arrived. I was very cold and curt to her because I was so upset about the whole thing. Deven D not being my chair anymore and the school not giving me any say in his replacement. I could tell she was trying to be very understanding and kind. She kept trying to help me mentally and emotionally with the transition. She was sitting in the chair in my office. I glanced out the window as I was talking to her and noticed that Barry C was milling around outside. Then I got even more upset. How did she know him? And why did he come along? I found out they were friends and when he found out she was coming here he talked her into letting him come along for the ride without telling her why he wanted to come along. This made me even more angry, though I said nothing to her about the fact that I even know him. I think my friends were in and out of the room trying to comfort me. She asked if her and I could go into another room and talk privately. I took her into my bedroom. As I entered the bedroom I remembered that I had been in the process of putting some laundry away when she showed up so I quickly scooped everything into a ball and covered it with a bath towel. She sat in one of my antique, cane-bottom chairs. I never allow anyone to sit in those chairs because they belonged to my grandmother. They are in pristine condition and I am so protective of them. not wanting anything to damage them in anyway. knowing that even too much body weight could cause the cane to start sagging. But I didn't say anything to her. I just let her sit down there and I went and sat very gingerly on the edge of the other one. We are now sitting at a restaurant having lunch, just the two of us. We have a table near a wall. But Barry C is sitting in a chair outside the window behind Rachel S. I think that I hate being put in the position. that I'm being rude to not invite him to have lunch with us yet I want nothing to do with him. He stands up and facing a wall leans his head forward, resting his forehead against the wall. like a small child would do to demonstrate feelings of discontent. sadness, being hurt,. I say something to Rachel S about inviting him to join us, so she motions him over and in seconds he is sitting in the chair to my left. Rachel S and I had already received our lunch and were eating so he ordered. I glanced at him once or twice, I'm sure with a look that he knew I was not happy about him being there, but never said a word to him."

I've read and been told that I need to love my body as it is. The theory is that alone will help me get unstuck. if I can embrace and love my body as it is. I was thinking that I really didn't look that bad, though I certainly feel better about the way I look WITH clothes on. But as I stand there I noticed my upper legs, and decided that this was the thing I was most unhappy with. I was surprised that I had never noticed this before. They looked very different in the dream though, than they do in waking life. I started thinking about what I would need to do, or could do, to improve the physical condition and look of my upper legs. Obviously my morning routine of walking isn't doing it. I decided that in the meantime I would help myself to feel better about my legs by focusing on the way they look in a dress or in a pair of slacks. because I nor others can see this part of my legs then."

I'm silent for a moment as I don't know who Dave S is, why he is calling, and why the laughter in his voice. He breaks the silence by telling me that I left a message for him. I suddenly recall that I had made some calls for CAS and left messages for a number of people. I did not want to breach confidentiality in my documents so I had listed them by first name and first initial of last name. I became concerned, actually pretty sure, that when I left a message for this person I had actually referred to him as Dave S, using the first initial of his last name when I said it."
"1049"	"(2005-03-20)"	"I was doing some kind of computer work. internet work. It had something to do with directory work. There was a problem that I was trying to fix. I couldn't decide if it wasn't working because of the way I was naming it or because of where I was saving it or because of how I was saving it or if I simply didn't have the right files. I don't know. "
"1050"	"(2005-03-20)"	"I am in a mall. I have a shoulder bag that seems like a cross behind a handbag and my library bag. I have it pretty full but it doesn't close like a handbag would. It's open like my library bag is. One of the things that I have in there is a scale, that a person would use to weigh themselves. But it was incredibly light. It was maybe only a pound or two in weight. I work at the mall. It seems to be before hours. There aren't a lot of people there yet, maybe just employees arriving for work. I don't think I work in one of the stores though but I have no idea where I do work. I'm standing someplace, I'm rubbing my progesterone cream into the inside of my arm like I always do and maybe some man sees me and comments how a quarter teaspoon does the trick. I say, Yes, it does. A woman about my age walks up to me and we engage in conversation. Whatever it is that we're talking about, I mention my progesterone cream and how I was so glad that my doctor had recommended it to me. I was really surprised at what a difference it had made. I was telling her a little bit about it. Her and I are talking about a number of different things though. We're also talking about working with men. I said, I remember when I worked in a management position at a regional office. There were 20 men and I was the only woman on the management team. I made some other comment about that. There's a group of workers, some men and women discussing timeclocks. There seems to be a problem with the wall timeclock. I walk away and pass the timeclock. I stop because I'm not sure if I should go ahead and clock in, knowing that there is a problem, because I don't know if they are automatically going to make the adjustments now that they know there is a problem. Or, should I clock in but then hand-write a note on it, or should I just come back later. I don't know what to do. I just go ahead and leave and don't do anything. I walk into this small room that reminds me of an office building break room. I'm standing there. I think I'm looking for something in my bag. Another, much younger woman walks in. I think she was going to prepare something to eat, for herself. She must be fairly new there because she's talking about how they have this room set up. They have some little tables to sit at but there is also a little kitchenette area. As she's talking she says something about there being no way to make toast or she's asking me if this thing will make toast. Then she just says, Oh well. I said, Well, here's the toaster as I point to it sitting to her left. She said, Oh. Great. She just hadn't noticed it."
"1051"	"(2005-03-20)"	"I had entered, or had someone enter a bunch of contacts in a database that we had sent the BCB book to either because they had purchased it or because we had given it to them. I'm not sure which. It was because of a specific campaign however. I was going through the listing and realized that they way they had been entered did not make it clear which campaign they were related to and we would have difficulty pulling up a report of these people for follow-up or for the next step of the campaign. I figured out a quick and easy fix, something that could be accomplished in just a few minutes, and began to make the fix. "
"1052"	"(2005-03-20)"	"I was walking through a suburban neighborhood on my way home. to my birth home. In a driveway I noticed this thing that looked like four crutches all attached by the end that goes against the ground. This caused them to form a windmill-like shape. Maybe they were attached by the other end to begin with because I think I changed it so they were attached by the other end. Then I could stand them on two of the arm ends so it would stand somewhat upright. There must have been one of these things in several driveways because I remember thinking there is another one. I watched how gravity pulled two of the pieces that were not braced against the ground. It also seems that I walked past at least one of them on more than one occasion. We had a female guest staying with us. We all had some concern about her finding her way around and us being able to successfully go find her if we thought she might be lost. I was in this field of sorts. It was all small trees with empty branches, no leaves, about the size of dogwood trees. I was supported midway in the air by the branches and I could see just above the tops of them to two of the outer edges of the field. I was going to let myself down to the ground but the field was so thick with these trees that I couldn't even see a place that I could put my feet on the ground. But as I lowered myself just a few inches I also realized that I would not be seen then and no one could ever find me if I did that. I raised myself back up. The field was L-shaped and I could only see two of the edges of the field. The two arms of the L extended further than I could see. I had a small audio-recorder in my hand that was the size and shape of a stopwatch. I began recording my location. I wanted to test and see if I recorded my location and took it to my family if they would be able to identify my location. If they could then we would know this would be a good tool for our guest to make sure she didn't get lost and we would be able to find her. However, I don't know how she could carry this with her to record her location and us have it also to be able to find her. As I was recording my location I said something about where the two arms of the L meet. Then I said I was going west along a certain street toward a store. When I came to a certain point I described it and said to now turn right, putting me on Keystone north/south. However, it looks like I am inside a building at this point. As I turned right, around a corner of two walls, I was faced with two doors. One was directly in front of me and one to my right. At first I thought I was in the wrong place but then I saw a sign on the door in front of me that said something about where it leads and it included my name in that description. Something like, Anna's____. But I can't remember what it said. I felt confident and good that I was in the right place and that this was going to work out well. I got home and was talking about what I did and the test message I recorded. My dad, different than in waking life, took the recorder from my hand. It was almost more like he snatched it from me because the way he did it startled me. He was holding it to his ear and listening to it. There were others standing there as well. We were on the breezeway. Daddy and some others were sitting and I some of the others were standing. While he continued to listen I stepped into the garage. There were rows of long tables, each spanning the length between the back and the front of the garage. All but one was piled with bright, deep-red, shiny strawberries. When I arrived home they had just taken a break from processing the berries that they had just picked. On the table nearest the side door that I entered, near the end of the table nearest the large, front garage door, was a chocolate cake. It was for someone's birthday and they had not seen it yet. It was shaped like a watermelon. Whoever had put the icing on it had not done a very good job. It looked very messy and sloppy. It didn't even appear to be on a cake platter. I was talking with someone, Mother I think, about the cake and how the person it was for should be please as chocolate is their favorite kind of cake."
"1053"	"(2005-03-24)"	"I'm with a bunch of members of my family. We go to a store to pick up some things. I don't know what we're traveling in but we're on water. It's not in a boat but I don't know what it is. As we're on our way to this store I look around and notice all these other people traveling also. I get very excited and tell everyone, Look. We're a part of The Amazing Race. All of these other people on the water are in this I mean, it's like in waking life they would never let boats be this close together. But we're as close together as we would be in a road race or in a marathon. But they all have I mean it's a wide variety of very unusual vehicles. Some of them look like cars, some look like tractors and some just look like very unusual things. I'm pointing this out to some of my family members and mentioning some of the things that I see. We go to the store and get what we need. To go back there's two large they look like wood picnic tabletops. That's what we're going to go back on. I want to attach them to each other so we're all together going back. Nobody else believes we can do it. I ask what the harm is in trying. I think we're actually going to try it. "
"1054"	"(2005-03-24)"	"I'm at a store and a clerk is trying to help me with something. Some man comes up. It almost seems like Don H the sportscaster. He wants to buy a copy of Bill C's book. He gets frustrated waiting for this clerk to finish helping me. I finally tell him that I will just give him a copy of the book. I tell him that I work for the author. I apologize that he is having to wait because of me. I suggest that he just take the book and tell him that I will give the store another copy to replace it. That way he doesn't have to wait and he doesn't have to worry about paying for it. Then he took the book back and we were going to go to my car and I was going to get him a copy out of my car. We went out to the parking lot. First I was having trouble finding my car. It didn't seem to be parked where I thought it was. We were walking around. I was getting upset because I felt bad for him that I was making him wait even longer, again, now. I finally saw it right where it was supposed to be. I opened my trunk. No. Maybe it was one of those storage pockets that some cars have in the back seat. on the back of the front seats. There were a bunch of papers and stuff in there. I was looking in those thinking that I had a copy of the book in there. I may have looked in the trunk also. I didn't have one. Then I felt really bad. I went back out to the parking lot later with Bill F."

Because he's upset that his computer isn't working well, I'm doing some housekeeping to maintain it. I open the internet options on the tools menu of his internet browser. I'm debating about whether or not to clear his cache and temporary internet files. I feel that some of this stuff needs to be done and will help but I also realize that he's been aggravated with his computer for some time even though his computer is probably not even a year old. "
"1056"	"(2005-03-24)"	"I'm in my home office with my husband. He's sitting in the desk chair. I'm sitting in his lap. We're talking about something. Whatever it is that we're talking about, I notice that it kind of reminds me of something I notice in his hair. It looks like dried leaves and stems from leaves. I start picking it out of his hair. After I get almost all but one or two little pieces that look like stems, them seem to be attached to his scalp. I got a pair of scissors to cut them off but then they aren't there anymore. After I do all of this I realize that he has no hair. I feel really bad and I'm apologizing to him and saying that I didn't realize. He is explaining to me but he doesn't seem upset about it all. As I look at him, I tell him that I really like this look, that he looks really good. Somehow there was a connection between what I found in his hair and to something totally different that we had been talking about. We continued talking about something. Now he has hair again, but it's really short, but it is balding on the crown of his head. It's very black. I really like it. I think it looks really good and I keep telling him this. We're kissing and hugging and just being very affectionate. He tells me how much he loves me. Now I'm standing behind the desk chair, facing him and leaning over and hugging him from behind. I asked him if he knows how much I love him. He said, Yeah. I think I have an idea. We're just having a really, really nice time together. I'm recognizing how wonderful it feels, to have him in my life, to be married to him, to have such a good and loving marriage. Now there is someone else there. Well, maybe we go do something else where there's other members of the family because Bill F is there now. It seems that we went and did some things outside, maybe more than once. Because he changed coats at one point. Now my husband and I and a female friend of ours is there and we're back in my home office. We're cleaning up. There is stuff everywhere. The office is larger in the dream than in waking life. There is stuff everywhere. It seems that maybe there is even a Futon or a small sofa in the office. There is stuff on it and there is stuff on the floor. Part of it is from Matthew. Matthew is just a child and had been in there playing a video game. All of this stuff is still sitting in there. I get a very large box. probably two and a half to three feet deep. I begin picking all of this stuff up and putting it in the box. We were going to go outside for a walk but I wanted to we were either just going to pick up a couple of things or we were looking for something before we went out. This female friend of ours said something about how much I said, Yes. I know. But while we're doing this I decided I might as well at least just pick everything up and put it into this box and take it into the other room. Part of what I'm picking up looks like stuff for the video game. Part of it is still plugged into the wall. As I'm doing this I find one of Bill F's coats. I said, Look. Bill F forgot his coat. It's probably his oldest, nastiest coat, like one he would wear to work around the house. She picks it up with two fingers and holds it away from her. I suggest we just hang it in Matthew's closet until he comes back or until I see him again. Before that it seems like I also found another one of his coat. When I found the second one I said something to the effect that he did switch coats once while he was here. This whole thing started that we were going out for a walk because my husband said something to me about wanting to make love in or on some sticks. That had something to do with his hair, because I was picking out these little things that were the size of stems of leaves. I had put a pile of them on the desk and I had said, Like these? We can use these. They'll be a little crunchy and stuff. He said that wasn't what he had in mind. That's when I pulled the rest of this stuff out of his hair. Then we decided to go outside for a walk and look for the kind of sticks that he was interested in or looking for. Also, while we were cleaning up the room he had something in his hands and was getting ready to go downstairs. I said, Honey. Before you go down He stopped and backed up a step. There was something downstairs that needed fresh batteries but I didn't know what size. I said, Would you take these batteries down with you? I told him why. I said, I don't know what size it needs but I have these here, so why don't you go ahead and take a couple of these down with you. They are in the drawer underneath the telephone. It was a huge pack of batteries that were probably 16 of them and stack in a cube shape and wrapped in the kind of plastic that many things are wrapped in when you purchase them. I broke the plastic enough to take the batteries out. They were C or D cell batteries. I didn't think that's what it needed but at first I thought that was all I had. After I gave them to him and he headed downstairs I saw a similar package of AAA batteries. I knew that's what I really needed for whatever it was downstairs. But I didn't do anything about it. I just kept cleaning up and let it go. "
"1057"	"(2005-03-25)"	"I arrive at a facility. I don't know what it is. I wouldn't call it a hotel. There's a number of buildings. I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go. It's snowing pretty heavily and it's accumulating pretty fast. It's becoming more difficult to pull my luggage on wheels through the snow. I decide to go into this one building to see if that's where I'm supposed to be. I can only open the door a few inches because it is blocked by women standing on the other side of it. The room is packed with women. I close the door and walk away. I decide again that probably is where I need to go in so I head that way again. I see another woman arrive and her husband is with her. They head towards another building until they see me. Then they decide to follow me. I notice this but they are quite a distance away in the parking lot, at least several hundred feet. I say loudly to them, If you're following me, I just want you to know that I'm not sure where I'm going. They follow me anyway. We go in. No one says anything to us. Some acknowledge that we've come in by looking at us or nodding their heads. There is a meeting going on. That's why they don't greet us verbally at that time. It's all women. It seems that it has something to do with weight loss. They're either trying to lose weight or maintain their current weight. Some of them have already reached their weight loss goals. It's not just one way to lose weight. They various women have used various methods to lose weight. I don't know if I'm thinking about the different ways or if I'm just thinking about the fact that they have lost the weight so many different ways. I'm not sure what I'm thinking or feeling at that point. It seems that there are now just a few women in the room. There is one woman that has an elastic band. It looks like white fabric, maybe 6-8 inches wide. It's large enough in diameter that she can cross her arms and have it wrapped around her crossed arms, just above the elbows. There is a man who has one two. He has it wrapped around his crossed arms in a particular way. He is an expert at how to use this thing. I don't know what its purpose is. He is trying to show her I'm looking at it and trying to figure out how he wrapped it around his crossed arms to get it on the way he has it. This other woman is looking at it trying to figure it out also. He's trying to explain it to her. He's trying to just tell her and she's not able to do it. He finally comes over and I guess he has taken his off at this point and is trying to show her how to wrap this thing and get it around her arms the right way. It seems that it has something to do with relaxation as opposed to losing weight, or that the relaxation will is an important part of losing weight. "
"1058"	"(2005-03-25)"	"I'm observing an operation, but I'm not standing in the room or even outside the room looking in. The surgical team is getting ready to operate on this woman. They haven't started yet because they have a number of concerns what seems to be at least one question that is very important that it be answered before they do anything. The question has something to do with something that she ate or may have eaten. They were concerned that it may have had a Koa Nut in it and if so the surgery would be much more dangerous and/or they would have to proceed differently, or maybe not at all. They were discussing the case. If she had eaten a Koa Nut, do they do anything with that? Do they need to? If so, what? Someone said something about a cereal that she eats on a regular basis, which has raisins and something else in it, maybe some kind of grain. This makes them realize that it does not have any nuts in it. Now they're confident that she has not eaten a Koa Nut. Now they know that it's okay to go ahead with the surgery. They are operating on her and they decide that the problem is a bad kidney so they removed her kidney. Then they also discovered that she had a double-hernia and so they removed that. A woman on the surgical team held up this very large organ, using a pair of surgical tongs, and said, it might have been this double hernia. It was oval in shape and about the size of a football."
"1059"	"(2005-03-27)"	"I was in my kitchen and my kitchen wasn't quite the same as it is in waking life. There were cabinets on both opposing walls. I was facing cabinets on the wall opposite the stove. I had sanded two of them down. I was getting ready to refinish them. And Niecy Nash, from the TV program Clean House, came in. They were there doing the show at someone else's house. Maybe someone close by? It was like she had taken a break from the show and had come in to see what I was doing. She said something about me refinishing the cabinets. I showed her how much nicer, how much prettier the wood looked after I had sanded them down. I just sanded down the doors on two of the cabinets. I was thinking about replacing the hardware as well. The ones I had sanded still had some spots that needed to be sanded. And on the one, the wood looked much prettier. First I showed her the one closest to the doorway. She saw the difference but wasn't all that impressed. Then I showed her the other one and she realized what I was talking about then how you could really see the wood grain and how pretty it was. So then she kind of agreed that it was a good idea. But it wasn't until then, after I had sanded two of them down, that I started thinking about the fact that it is a rented building and would the landlord mind me doing this? I didn't think they would because I would just be improving the property. Making it look nicer. But yet, I didn't ask them beforehand. And now I had already done two of them so I was kind of stuck."
"1060"	"(2005-03-30)"	"Matthew as about 10 or 11 years old. Some neighborhood children had come to the door and asked him or me to come they were talking about where they lived or where they were . They called it _____ Manor. Our neighbor was outside at her front door. She asked me if I knew where that was. I turned around and pointed behind us. I said, Yes. I'm pretty sure it's back there about a block. She doubted me, but I was pretty sure that I knew what they were talking about. Matthew and I went back there and it turned out they were trying to put together. there were a bunch of people from the neighborhood there. adults and children. They were trying to put together a volleyball game. It was an indoor game. Matthew and I both went in and were going to play. There were quite a few people there. People just started going to one side or the other of the net. Matthew went to the side furthest from the door and I went to the other side. I was counting to see if we were evenly divided up and also looking to see if it would be evenly divided between children and adults. There seemed to be a lot more adults than children and it was kind of hard to see the children for all the adults. We started playing. It was very cramped quarters. I don't know what this building was. It almost looked like a storage building. There was stuff piled everywhere and very close to the edge of the court. When we were serving, or any time, I was feeling a little uneasy about running into things when I served or went after a play or anything. There is apparently one man in the neighborhood who is really good. He is the one who wanted to do this. He wanted to have more people to play with to help him hone his skills. We weren't doing very well. none of us were. We stopped and were waiting for something. I don't know what. I was looking at my watch and realized it was 9:20 in the evening. I thought I really needed to get home. We start playing again. This man shows up and is giving pointers. But now it almost looks more like a Ping-Pong table. He's leaning over on it and giving pointers. He's giving pointers to me and I hit one. It kind of goes straight down and lands on my side of the net instead of the other. He tells me what I did wrong. I'm slightly irritated because I knew what I did wrong. It wasn't a matter of not knowing what I was doing. It was more a matter of not having honed that skill. I didn't say anything. I sensed that the other people felt the same way but they didn't say anything either. Now we got stopped again for some reason. We're standing there waiting around. I look at my watch again and realize it's 10:15. I tell some of the others that I needed to go. that I hadn't realized how late it had gotten. I went outside to go home and it was just starting to rain. I was facing a building. I turned to my left and was going to go home that way. Then I realized that if I went to my right I could go down the alley and across my front yard and it would be a tad-bit shorter. Plus, when I got to the front of my building there would be trees and stuff so I would be more protected by the rain. But it looked more like a block of houses then. It didn't look like my own neighborhood. It was a mixture of both Caucasian and African-American people. "
"1061"	"(2005-04-01)"	"I was with a man for business purposes. I didn't know him well. He said he needed to go by his apartment for something and wanted me to go with him and we could continue talking while we drive and while we were there. We got there. It was an apartment on the 3rd or 4th floor. The apartment was a mess. There was stuff piled everywhere. I was trying to decide if they were packing and getting ready to move or maybe they had just recently moved in and they hadn't had a chance to unpack yet. Or, maybe he was just a major slob. You could hardly find a place to step without stepping on something. Some of it was boxes but there also seemed to be clothes strewn about everywhere. He changed his clothes and then sat down on his bed because that was the only place to sit down. It almost looks like a studio apartment, that there was just the one room besides the kitchen and bathroom. He was semi-reclining on the bed, leaning his back against the headboard. In trying to find places to step to get to the bed to sit down and talk with him I tripped over something and fell onto the bed. I actually landed on partially on top of him, face down. We connected maybe waist down. I stopped for a minute because I was embarrassed. I don't know why I didn't quickly move off of him. He made a very slightly suggestive comment to me. I looked at him briefly, trying to decide how to respond to his comment, or even how I felt about him making the comment. Then he said something about my breasts. He thought they were beautiful. He said it would be very nice to see them without my blouse on. He had not touched me inappropriately. I sat up on the bed and we continued talking about business. I'm in that same position again, half lying on top of him, but I don't know how I got in that position again. He said something again, about my breasts. This time I decided to take my top off. He gently helped me pull it off over my head. I wasn't wearing a bra. He still didn't touch me my breast. He put his hand on the back of my neck and started to pull me into him to kiss him but a noise distracted him. He jerked his head and turned to the side, trying to hear better and figure out what the noise was. After a couple of seconds he turned back and once again started to pull me close to him. Then the same thing happened. A noise startled him. He suddenly jumped out of bed, rolling me to the side. He said, grab your blouse and your shoes. We have to go now. I wondered what was going on. I told him I couldn't find them. He said, Come on. We have to go. We have to go. He's almost in a panic. He has one of my shoes in his hand. I pick up the other one while I'm pulling on my blouse and heading out the door. He's at least 10-15 feet, probably more than that, ahead of me. He's bolting down all of these steps. We had to take the steps going up to his apartment. The steps are steep and not built like normal flights of steps. There would be one flight and then a few feet to the right the next flight would start but going down in the same direction, and so on. I noticed the lighting around the steps is unusual. It's kind of an orange-gold light. Not really bright but enough that I really noticed it. as opposed to it just being light outside. I'm going down the steps as fast as I can trying to catch up with him. As we're headed down the steps I pass three women coming up. I don't know who they are. They're talking. One or two of them look at me briefly but don't say anything. They just looked at me the way anyone would look at a stranger as they pass them. just noticing that I'm there. As I get to the ground I realize that this man is married and one of those women was his wife. I don't know how I know this, he's separated but he's still living with his wife. When I was in his apartment I still thought he was single. It wasn't until we were headed down the steps and I passed these women that I realized that one of them was his wife. They were sleeping in separate beds. I remember seeing two twin beds in the apartment. We had been on one of the twin beds. "

I followed the group to the left. Some people walking the same direction as I was kept turning around and looking back and questioning if we were headed the right way. I was relatively sure that we were and tried to assure them of that. We kept going on the direction that we had been."
"1064"	"(2005-04-08)"	"I was working in some kind of a document. It had tables. I was transferring text from one table into another. The second table was much wider than the first. As I was transferring the text I was reformatting it to fit the size of the wider table. I was doing it one cell at a time. I finally figured out a way. There were four different sets of tables. I finally figured out a way that I could transfer all of the text from one table into the new one for each set at one time instead of doing it a cell at a time. I was feeling good that it was done and that I had found this way to do the whole thing at once for each set. But then I found out that it wasn't right and I got really aggravated. "
"1065"	"(2005-04-09)"	"I was at the home of someone I knew. Maybe BJ's. I was inside and there were a bunch of people outside. It seems that they're all in a car. in one car. There are ten or eleven people. I don't think it's a bedroom that I'm in but there is a full or double bed. There is stuff piled up everywhere. I can hardly walk. I'm thinking about where people are going to sleep. At first I'm not sure how many people there are. For some reason I think that this is going to be fine, that there's enough room for everyone. I'm thinking there's only two of us besides BJ. BJ comes in and we're talking about where people are going to sleep. She said something to me about everyone needing to sleep in that one room. I don't think there's any way that we can do that. I think that's when I realize there are ten or eleven people. I think there is one other person in the room now too. Maybe Bev. I'm just thinking there is no way we can all sleep in this one room. There's stuff everywhere so there's not even room on the floor. Then someone says something about Carter (from the TV program Trading Spaces) being one of the people. I said, Oh. Well. If Carter is one of them we can have three people in that one bed and he just has to sleep in the middle. I'm, of course, one of the people sleeping in the bed. We banter a little bit about that. "
"1066"	"(2005-04-10)"	"I was working for a charity. I was helping them with an event. There were selling things to raise money. One of the things that we were selling was a very large heart-shaped get well card. It had been made by a little boy by the name of Steven Brian. Brian was his middle name. It was about 2 feet by 3 feet. He had used different colors of construction paper that he had cut up and pasted on it. It was very childlike writing. He had written with colored crayons. various colors. He had it signed by everyone on the city NBA team. We were selling it for five dollars. As we were preparing for this event I said to someone that it would be very cool for someone who had a child named Steven Brian. that they may be especially interested in this. As I'm working at this event, I see a man there with his little boy and I hear him call him Steven Brian. I went up to him and at first was chatting with him, being friendly. Then I mention that I mention that I have this thing with the name Steven Brian on it. He doesn't seem particularly interested. I went and got it anyway and brought it back and showed it to him and explained to him what it was. He still doesn't seem sold. I said, If you're a fan, it's a fun and interesting way to have all of the signatures. Then he said that maybe he would buy this and something else that he had been looking at as well. Then I was talking to someone else I was working with about this man. that I had overheard him talking to his son and call him Steven Brian. Same group. More dimensions. Don't know what they are or what they're for. There was something later about the Steven Brian card being. something about white satin. Also, something about going to the computer and going to the properties section of a document and editing the properties of this document related to this event. The facility where it was being held seemed to be some kind of commercial facility. Yet, it looked, at least at one point, more like a home. There was one man in particular who was responsible for this event, or in charge of it. His wife was there helping as well. This same woman is on the computer editing properties of other items that we're selling. Now there is some kind of a dance event. maybe that evening. We are discussing it. We want to make sure there are enough steps in each dance or enough time in each dance to allow all of the volunteers to fully engage with a prospect to the point where they feel honest, feel safe opening up to us, being honest with us, and thus resulting in a contribution. I'm having a conversation with a number of other volunteers or people working there about the properties of these items and the dance and various other things."
"1067"	"(2005-04-11)"	"I was working in an Excel Sheet but have no idea what it was I working on. There were other people around, that I was talking to, maybe they were giving me input or answering questions about what I was putting on the spreadsheet. I was moving things around. Inserting columns or rearranging them."
"1068"	"(2005-04-11)"	"I was working in an office, but I don't think it was CAS. The boss definitely was not Bill C. There were a lot of people there, maybe 20-30. Maybe 10 or more were employees and the others were clients that were there for a meeting. I think the WI Company was there for a meeting. I passed Steve W and we both nodded and mouthed the word hello. As we did I realized that it was him but didn't say anymore, even though I hadn't met him before. There was a lot of activity. just like you would see right before any kind of event, when people are getting ready to take their seats and chatting with each other and such. Susan J worked there. Something had happened with her boyfriend that she was upset about. It seems that maybe he was serving in the armed forces and was detained from coming home when he was supposed to. There was some connection between this and red and purple roses. Susan J had made a bunch of red and purple roses out of tissue paper. They were about 6 inches in diameter. She came out of her room once and she was wearing some kind of outfit, or costume, that she had made. She had covered it with these roses. Then she went back into her room. Some of us were talking about what we could do to help her, as she was clearly very upset about her boyfriend. We had tried something, as a group, to cheer her up or provide some comfort but it didn't work. The boss hadn't wanted anything to do with it. I don't think he wanted to be bothered and I think that he also did not want any of the rest of us spending our time this way. So then someone made a bunch more of these tissue-paper roses and planned something else to try to comfort or cheer her. Myself and another woman went to her room. We knocked on the door but without waiting for an answer opened the door just a bit. I stuck my head in to look for her as I called her name. As I was doing this, though, I realized that it was inappropriate for me to open the door without waiting for her to answer. As I put my head in the door it was pretty dark in there. It was a bedroom and I saw her lying in bed. She had been lying on her right side, with her back to the door. As I called her name again, she heard me and leaned up on her right elbow and turned her head over her right shoulder towards the door. I asked her to come out for a minute. that we needed her for something. When she came out six people were wearing the rose outfits/ costumes. They were standing in a row. Everyone else had formed rows behind them. Even the boss was involved this time, and he didn't seem to mind. It seemed that he had realized just how much Susan J was hurting and he now wanted to be part of trying to help her feel better. I don't know if what we did worked or not. Everyone started leaving. I don't know where Susan J is now. I spoke a little bit with the boss."

"1070"	"(2005-04-12)"	"I was at the computer and I was going through an online archive of an author's online newsletters. As I was going through them I saw one that. these newsletters were laid out so there was a header across the full width of the top. Then there were two columns. The left-hand column was a bit narrower than the right, but not much. It was a very dark background. It was a color, maybe navy. The font was white. The text in the right column at times cut off. You had to click on it to read the full text. I saw one that looked to me like it was DOP, which Bill C wrote. I didn't click on it for sure. I just immediately assumed that's what it was. Because of the date of it I knew it had been written before Bill C wrote DOP. I immediately got upset about that and distrusted Bill C and started thinking that all of his content is just a rewrite of someone else's stuff. I started thinking all these bad things about Bill C. It almost seems the title of the one that I saw on this other author's newsletter was The Death of Reason. "
"1071"	"(2005-04-15)"	"I was driving through St. Joe. Matthew was in the car with me. As we were driving I saw some small children along the road in a few places. It was Halloween. They were wearing costumes and were out Trick or Treating. I was shocked to see a baby. As I continued to drive I saw something lying in the road in front of me. I tried to slow down but was afraid I was not going to be able to miss it. I swerved enough so my car went over the top of it but none of the tires or anything hit. As I passed over it I realized it was that baby. I slammed on the brakes and pulled to the side of the road and went back and picked up the baby. There was a toddler standing alone along the side of the road where the baby was. No one else was anywhere in site. We put the baby and the toddler in the car with us and went to the mother's. The baby was wrapped in a light blue blanket and her name was Kylie. As I unwrapped the blanket I found a brown wallet. It looked like a man's wallet and it was stuffed full of papers and pictures. I didn't even look to see if there was any money in it. I started going through it quickly hoping to figure out who the baby was and who her parents were. I found a picture of several teenage girls. Bev was in the picture. She was at mother's too so I asked her to look at the picture and see if she could remember who the other girls were in the picture. She pointed to one and said that was Kylie. We got out the phone book and looked up her parents phone number. I called and got an answering machine and left a message for the mother. After a while she had not called me back so I called again and left another message. After a short time the father called back. When I spoke to him he said they had intentionally left the children there. That were going through a very difficult time financially and they just couldn't afford to keep the children. My initial reaction was that I was furious but I knew it would do no good to say anything to him so I just said okay and hung up. I started thinking about what I should do next. The thought of keeping the children occurred to me. Then I was thinking about the fact that they can pay a phone bill but they can't keep their children. Why don't they cut expenses some other ways like cutting off their phone rather than just dumping their children on the road? I have a sense that they have more children and they kept them. I thought the appropriate thing to do would be to call child social services. Then I thought about Chrisy R and Mark R and how many times they have fostered children and wondered about just asking them to take the children and handle everything since they know who to talk to and the process and everything."
"1072"	"(2005-04-21)"	"There were quite a few people and a lot of information on one or more Excel spreadsheets. I think I woke up probably ten times during this dream, for just seconds, and then went back to sleep and the dream continued. I'm not sure if I really woke up though. Each time I thought about the dream and was trying to figure out what we were doing with the sheets or what we were supposed to be doing with them. So, I don't know what sleep state I was in when I was wondering if the row labels on each sheet were the same, if the column labels were the same or neither. At some point I finally decided that we needed to combine all of the information onto one sheet. I know I at least decided the row labels were the same but I can't recall if I made a decision about the column labels. But since there were so many people working on this and so many different sheets I was concerned about how we were going to accomplish this, and/or the best way to accomplish it."
"1073"	"(2005-04-22)"	"I was with a group of people in the SAID office. It was an older house. We were all sitting in the living room. Along one wall was a door and, facing the door from the inside, immediately to the left of the door was a window. The bottom of the window was about 3 feet from the floor. In front of that window along the adjacent wall was a sofa and there were several people sitting on it. I was sitting diagonally from the window. There was a whiteboard hanging in front of the window. It was made of 8 _ by 11 sections that were somehow connected on the vertical ends. Someone had written things on it in red. I went over and took it down, talking to someone about it while I did so. I don't know why I took it down. Then, for some reason related, I stepped outside the door. High up on the wall was another 8 _ x 11 panel that looked like another piece of the whiteboard. I was going to clean it off. Some others were standing there and chuckling, saying I would never be able to reach it. I jumped a little as I reached for it and I was able to reach it and clean it. At first I thought I didn't really need to jump to reach it but then it almost feels as though I was suspended in air as I cleaned it. Then I began cleaning the glass on the outside of the window. I was thinking that the whole building could really use some minor cleanup and repair and that we should do that as a group. I sprayed a lot of window cleaner on the glass and cleaned it with a paper towel. The towel that I had was very small and quickly became saturated and wrapped into a small ball. I threw it away. The whiteboard(s) that I had previously taken down were now documents hand-written in black ink on parchment. They weren't very legible and the paper was becoming worn and tattered. The information was very important to SAID. I asked if I could take them home, make them into typed formal-looking documents and frame them to hang in the room. I was looking primarily at Raina D when I asked this. She tilted her head down and looked at me over the top of her glasses. The way she looked at me told me she did not approve of the suggestion."
"1074"	"(2005-04-23)"	"Doctor Pf had ordered some kind of test for me. I went to have it done. It was in a building that reminded me of a very old house, early 20th century. There were rows of chairs set up for the people waiting and there many people there. As I sat there and waited I chatted a bit with the people sitting on either side of me. As we talked we realized that from behind us someone working there was beginning to rearrange the seating and moving all the chairs around. They asked us all to stand and to pick up any of our belongings from under or around the chair. They came to us just as we heard it. I had put a satchel under my chair and as I stood up reached for it. As I did the person working there began to move my chair. He seemed to get upset with me that I didn't move and said something to me about having been told to gather our belongings. I told him that is what I was trying to do but my bag seemed to be stuck under the chair. In one part of the room there is a large square area that is bordered with a counter/desk a little more than waist-high. This was the nurse workstation. One of them called for anyone from St. Joe. I was surprised that there were about six of us there who went up to the desk. I looked at two of them kind of closely to see if I knew them. Neither of them seemed to care if they knew anyone else there or not so I turned my attention back to the nurses. Two of the nurses were standing on the same side of the desk as we were and talking about scheduling us for our tests. We were told that there were three or so doctors available and doing the tests and we could choose which one we wanted to do the test. One of them was Doctor C. I was pleased to hear he was one of them yet surprised and didn't understand why he was doing this type of testing. Two people had gotten in line in front of me even though I had arrived at the desk first. The nurse had a desktop one-day calendar and was having us sign our names on the left page for the time slot we wanted. She said we could actually go as soon as the one before us was finished but signing by a time would give them and us a rough idea of the schedule. The two people before me both signed up for Doctor C. I debated whether or not I wanted to sign up for him. I really wanted to see him and visit with him, but I wasn't sure I wanted him doing this test on me. I wondered if I would have to remove any of my clothes. I finally went ahead and signed up to see him. One of the nurses said something about where we leave the building but I either didn't hear or didn't understand what she said. I went to the double-doors where I thought I came in and they were locked. I tried another set and they were also locked. I was a bit frustrated and then I saw through a window someone entering from a side door and immediately went to that door to exit."
"1075"	"(2005-04-23)"	"This dream was about the paradox of fear and love. There were several circles. I know at least two but maybe three. On the perimeter of each circle were 8 points, all equally spaced from each other. At each point there was an image that I can best describe as an exaggerated Hershey Kiss. or a teardrop with a tail on the top. Based on some information I am repositioning these flames. always keeping them at the same points on the circles but trading one from one circle with one from another or trading them within one circle. Now there is just one circle and based on the information I now have I am trying to determine if I can appropriately put a flame on the circle and I decided I can definitely put one on it, but can't decide about more. Then there is another circle and the same thing happens. Now I'm thinking about these last two circles."

"1077"	"(2005-05-06)"	"I think that I was buying or had already bought a house with someone else. We were working on cleaning it up I guess. On the property there was an old run-down trailer in what was supposed to be the front yard. The people before had been using it as an office specifically to do writing. And there was something about, maybe it was mostly teenagers or young people who had used it. I don't know what this is but there's an image of five documents laid out on a table. Three in one row and then two directly above. One directly above the middle one and then another directly above the one to the left."
"1078"	"(2005-05-08)"	"I was working for a company other than CAS and with probably six or more other people. One of the people was actor, Dennis Quaid. Dennis Q and I got along particularly well and became fairly close. For quite a while we were just close friends but it did eventually develop into a romance. like when people become best friends first and then fall in love. Sometimes a group of us would go places together and he would put his arm around me as we walked and I would reciprocate. Still, initially, it was just a friendly gesture. One evening we were going to an opening event of a new business, owned by someone we knew. As we were walking with our arms around each other we were talking and laughing. He was to my left. I reached my right arm around and lightly caressed his stomach. It was at that point that I realized this was becoming more and just knew that he felt the same way. that he realized it too. We were off to ourselves at one point in the evening when we finally acknowledged these new feelings to each other. We shared a light, brief, yet very sensual kiss. Oddly, it's as though I'm watching this happen though too. maybe it's because I realize that others can see us, or did see this. The opening event was outdoors. The main gathering was taking place on something like a deck. But it was about the size of a couple of homes. very large. And it was bordered on at least one side by a body of water. Something happened and water began rushing up and flooding the deck with a powerful force, almost like a mild Tsunami. A few of the people I was with noticed it first and began yelling, Run. Run. So I immediately began to run, following them. I turned around to look for Dennis. I saw him behind me and hoped desperately he would catch up with me. I turned around again and looked to see where he was and saw he had closed the distance between us and was sure he would now catch up with me. Just as I finished this thought, and as the waves of water were enveloping people and furniture, I saw Dennis get caught between a bunch of furniture and go under. I stopped in my tracks and went back to try to find him and try to help get him out if he was stuck. So did a couple of the other men we were with. We couldn't find him. We went back to someone's apartment. Some of the men were going to put on diving suits and go back and try again. They were exhausted from the search effort they already made. I am in a panic and just praying that Dennis Q is okay. The one man falls down on a bed and is tangled up in all kinds of clothes. I am helping him out of the tangled mess and we realize that as he was in the water searching for Dennis other people's clothing had come off and had become tangled around his legs. It was all underwear. As I pulled each one off, we all looked at it to determine if it might belong to Dennis Q and each time we decided it wasn't. We are now going to this opening event again. before the flood or anything happened. This time, we knew what was going to happen so we could not only be prepared and protect ourselves but could help to protect more other people as well. As the time of the flood drew near Dennis Q and some others from an upper part of the deck began handing out floatation devices. I think they are called water worms. They were tossing some down to people on lower levels of the deck. They were all navy blue in color. I had two. This time I stayed close to Dennis Q and we managed to be close enough to the exit that we were able to get out in time with no problem."
"1079"	"(2005-05-13)"	"I was with Bill C in a hotel room. Kara C and a friend of hers was there as well. It was a very large room and on either end of the room there was an enclosed staircase leading up to a second room. Kara C and her friend were upstairs playing. Bill C and I were downstairs having a very serious conversation. It was either about our relationship or about something that impacted or was impacted by our relationship. We simultaneously and impulsively both reach out for a physical connection or expression of this underlying intensity. Initially it is a very light connection, each of us touching the others arms and a light kiss on the lips. I'm wondering about the sleeping arrangements for the night, as there is only one bed and it does not seem that large. I know that Kara C and her friend are upstairs but don't realize that there is a bed up there. I see that the hotel has brought in a second bed, one that is on wheels, has a thin mattress and folds up in half to allow for easy transport from one room to another. I decide that I will sleep there and Kara C and her friend can share the bed with Bill C. The physical connection becomes more intimate as Bill C removes his shirt and opens his trousers. My thoughts and emotions become even more intense and confusing. I'm not sure what to do, if anything. I'm not sure what to say, if anything. We are both standing. We lie down on the bed, he on his back and me on my side. I am still fully clothed. Kara C and her friend enter the room. There is a bed sitting perpendicular to and at the foot of the one we are in. They both jump up on that bed and begin talking to us. I have a feeling that Kara C knows what has been going on but doesn't seem to mind. Eventually they go back upstairs. Bill C is now out of bed and has removed all of his clothing. I am still lying in bed fully clothed. I am noticing his body. his thin, tall frame. I notice something about his skin around his waist. It seems pleated for lack of a better word, and dark red. Of course I say nothing. The girls come back down and climb into the other bed, ready to go to sleep. We are both fully clothed, lying in the same bed but not next to each other. Jane C comes in and thinks nothing of the fact that we are in the same bed. She assumes that there would be nothing going on between us and that I'll be spending the night in another bed. I decide to sleep in the bed upstairs but can tell Bill C is not happy about that. There is another bed sitting perpendicular and to the side of the one that Bill C and I had been in. Bill C and Jane C leave the room and I curl up in the middle of the third bed, lying in a fetal position, partially covered with a blanket that had been thrown haplessly onto the bed. I am still clothed. Bill C comes back into the room and briefly lies down with me. He very gently and warmly holds me for a few moments and kisses me tenderly, before getting back out of my bed, and before Jane C comes back in. At some point I was talking to Jane C and she told me that Bill C used to be a medical doctor but that he gave up practicing medicine to begin this company. At first I was quite surprised by this. and that I didn't know that before now. As I thought about it I wondered if this is why he is always so interested in figuring people out or why he seems to read more into things than what is there. that he is always looking for more than what is presented."
"1080"	"(2005-05-14)"	"I am in a restaurant, sitting at the bar with a man that I know, though I don't know him in waking life. We're sitting there talking when another man that we both know enters. I'm surprised that he chooses to sit on the empty stool to my right rather than on the empty stool to the left of the man I am there with. The three of us just happened to see each there by coincidence. None of us had planned to meet any of the other two there. I've known both of these men for some years. I notice the way the second way is behaving and wonder if there is some undisclosed romantic interest. His name is Jon. I think about this and wonder why I've never even considered him in this way before. He has shown up here today in a pursuit of information somehow related to the New York Mets. I see a group of 10-12 men that I know, some are relatives (one is John S). They are leaving a sports bar. They are on a trek to visit New York Mets bars in various cities. They go to each city long enough for a brief visit to their local New York Mets bar and then they move on to the next city. I don't know if Jon is following them or if he just happens to show up at a lot of the same places. I am now in another city, standing on a sidewalk trying to find the New York Mets bar so I can locate Jon. I am looking across the street at a couple of small businesses and their colorful signs atop their doors. I think I entered a building thinking I could go through to get to where I wanted but once I got inside I realized I was inside the parking garage for a hotel and I had no way out. A one-way door or gate had closed behind me. It's very dark. The parking garage is full, with the cars all be parked side-by-side and bumper to bumper. I hear a loud noise and notice a few hundred feet away that a pick-up truck is leaving the garage. I wish I was closer so I could sneak out right behind the truck. His truck triggered something in the cement that caused the exit door or gate to open and let him out. I notice a narrow walkway along the far wall of the building where he exited and decided to make my way over there and see if I could trigger the door myself. As I approached the walkway I noticed numerous metal plates in the cement. I heard a lot of noise as the various plates began moving up and down at different intervals and not all together. Some of these were part of the walkway that I had intended to get on. I debated whether or not to proceed but decided I could maneuver over the moving plates without getting hurt. As I did so the gate opened. I was close enough that I thought I would be able to get out. I neared the gate and part of it swung freely, and towards me, and I had to jump back to avoid being hit. I noticed how dirty it was and I seemed just as concerned about getting dirty as I was about being hit. I finally ducked down and was able to make my way out of the building. I was standing right outside and to the right of the exit, in front of a wall. A female employee was now standing right inside the exit and talking to someone across the street. She was saying something about that door malfunctioning and she was doing something to try to fix it. I was hoping she wouldn't see me there as I didn't want to get into trouble for being in there. She saw me and asked if she could help me with anything, not suspecting that I had been inside. I told her what I was looking for. She pointed across the street to one of the businesses I had been looking at earlier. I wondered why I hadn't realized earlier that it was the place I was looking for. As I approached the door I noticed that the front windows were full of sports related objects, all in green and yellow. I entered the sports bar. As I entered there was as display case in the middle of the aisle directly in front of me. I noticed Jon sitting alone, back and to my right. I started to make my way around the left of the showcase and this group of men that I knew, making their NY Mets trek passed me on their way out. I said something to one of them that I knew to get his attention. to let him know I was there. He briefly acknowledged me with a nod but kept walking. Then I saw John S and reached out and tapped him on the shoulder. He kept walking but turned to me and said, Can't stop. Gotta keep going. He said something else about their trek but I don't remember what. I now turned back to my right and saw that Jon was now sitting at the back of the bar on a bench, like you would see in a locker room. He is watching a TV and seems very sad. There is a man sitting along a wall to my left. He sitting on a raised platform that is constructed kind of like a niche in a wall. It is not much larger than he is. I approach him to kind of reprimand him for not participating in this important task that Jon has embarked on. I realize that he is a past manager of the NY Mets. As I near him I realize that he face is seriously disfigured. He has only one eye, in the middle of his face and it doesn't even look like a normal eye. I just realize that it is an eye. There are other markings and deformities on his face. I try not to let my thoughts or feelings about his appearance show on my own face or in my voice. I ask him why he is not participating in this task. He asks me if I would do it if I were him. I say that I would like to think that I would. I go back and sit down next to Jon. He doesn't even acknowledge that I am there. He seems very, very sad. There is another man sitting in a chair facing both of us. He has been watching TV with Jon. He knows both of us. I begin to talk to Jon. He is leaned over with his right elbow resting on his right knee, with his chin resting in the palm of his hand. I lean over where my face is almost directly in front of his. I am talking to him to try to offer a different, more positive perspective, of his effort. I want to help him feel better. As I'm talking to him he continues a focused gaze at the TV. I now reach with my left hand and take his chin in my hand and turn his face slightly more towards me. He continues his focused gaze on the TV. I bring my face very close to his so that our cheeks touch very lightly. I'm debating whether to kiss him, or wondering if he will kiss me. I realize that the thought does not even occur to him and I back away, continuing to talk to him."
"1081"	"(2005-05-21)"	"It was as though I were lying in bed with my eyes closed listening to the TV. to program after program that I had not heard of or watched before. I was surprised that I had fallen asleep with the TV on, as that is something I very rarely do anymore."
"1082"	"(2005-05-21)"	"Flames of light pointing downwards and I had been instructed to, or it had been suggested, that I fold them in half so the pointed end was pointing up rather than down. I wondered how this would be possible to do this and I also wondered if this had anything to do with my Eight Points of Light dream. "
"1083"	"(2005-05-22)"	"Matthew and I were moving into a new apartment, and my brother Bill F was helping us. Our apartment was on the fourth, and top, floor and the only way up was stairs. Each floor had just one apartment and the top of each flight of stairs was open to that floor's apartment. I didn't realize this until we started moving in and I found it uncomfortable. As I was going up the stairs I was thinking about the fact that everyone else could see all my comings and goings, or anyone that came to visit me, if they happened to be in that room when we were going up or down the stairs. Our apartment seemed to be two floors. The second floor or our apartment was a master suite. It was divided into four living areas by half walls. each wall coming up from the floor about three feet. From the top step, facing the room, the bedroom area was to the left. The sitting area was in the middle. A work or office area was immediately to the right of the sitting area and there was a dressing area to my right, in front of the office area. The people who lived there previously had left a lot of furniture and other things. I wasn't sure what I was going to do with all of it, whether I was going to keep it all, some of it, or what. I was thinking that it was time for a lunch break and that ice cream for dessert sounded like a nice treat. I was getting ready to go down and ask Bill F and Matthew if they wanted lunch when I saw some food sitting in trays in the sitting area. Each tray was a square that came up about 2-3 inches on each side to keep the food from falling off. It looked like maybe it was Mexican food, burritos or something like that but each tray also had an ice cream cone lying on its side. I thought I should try to take the ice cream cones out and put them in the freezer so they wouldn't melt before we were ready to eat them. I tried to pick one up but was having trouble doing so without getting my fingers in it or the other food. It also may have been stuck to the tray. I am walking around the bedroom area and notice a high shelf or storage area in the front left corner. It is about 3 feet deep and enclosed on all sides except the front. It was full of stuff that the prior tenants had left there. It seemed to be mostly cleaning appliances like various types of vacuums and such. Bill F came in and I pointed this out to him. Bill F would love finding treasures such as this. He was tall enough that he could reach up and get them down without a ladder or anything. We began looking to see what was there. The front wall section of the shelf had a square or rectangular cutout. I could see through and saw a lot of stuff on through there. I realized that it was the apartment of the people on the other side of that wall. That it was their stuff stored on their similar shelf. I began walking around to determine if I wanted to keep the layout the same. I noticed a wooden dressing table sitting in front of a double window in the dressing area. The table was a cream color and distressed. There were curtains over the window. I thought that would be great place for the office, as it would allow me to work at the computer in front of the window. I walked to the window and looked out. I was surprised and disappointed to find that the window was in a wall that connected to the apartment on the other side and looked directly into their apartment. I wasn't sure I wanted to put my desk there after all. Then I noticed a side window in what was currently the office area. It was a wider window, maybe triple, and had curtains over it as well. I walked to that window and looked out. Now, more disappointed that it too just looked into someone else's apartment. They had left a desk there and I began opening the drawers and looking inside. The drawers had a lot of office supplies in them, but I could tell they left them on purpose because of the way they were haphazardly piled into a few top drawers. I walked into the living area and began looking in the drawers of some of the furniture sitting there. I was pulling the things out that had been left in those drawers. There were two or three women sitting there chatting. I didn't know who they were or why they were there or how they got in. I looked up at one of them and she told me that they live over there pointing behind her back. What was the dressing area was now one of their rooms. They said we share this sitting area. I was very upset by this and that I had not been told about this before we signed the lease and began moving in. I did not like this lack of privacy at all. As the woman told me this she slammed a drawer shut that I had opened. It obviously had some of her things in it. She pointed that had moved the TV into their rooms for when I want to watch TV. My mind immediately began working on solutions and I thought I would just always watch my own TV from my bed. Still, with only half-walls, I would have no privacy. Now that room of theirs was a bedroom. This woman and her husband and one of their mothers lived together and all slept in the same bed. The man and the mother were in bed and having an argument over something. Now the bed is a double-length bed and one that we all had to share each night. I would sleep with my head at one end and they would sleep with their three heads at the other end. But the linens were each one long piece so we shared the sheets and blankets. I'm getting more and more upset about this whole arrangement. about the fact that I was not told any of this before I signed the lease and decided to move. If it weren't for this and the flights of steps being open to each tenant it was a lovely place. much newer than where we had been living."
"1084"	"(2005-05-27)"	"Bev was getting married and I was in the wedding party. I was sitting in front of a table and something was dripping down on my dress as a result of something that Jody S had done. The whole front of my dress, from the waist down, it was kind of a yellow or pale color dress, whatever it was that was dripping down had almost completely covered the front of my dress in a bright red or orange. I went someplace and was going to take it off for a little while. Jody S or someone was going to wash and dry it very quickly. They thought we could get it done on time. But then, they ended up having me sit, like on the edge of a bathtub and they just showered me off while I still had the dress on. All of this stuff came out. It was a very lightweight fabric so it air-dried in time. But then something else happened and there was I thought it had just put a little mark on the front of the dress, like 2 or 3 inches long. But it ended up being a tear. It was kind of like two layers of fabric. Like maybe chiffon over satin. This had torn through both layers. I was very upset again. Someone told me not to worry about it that it really wasn't noticeable. But then later it was like a whole big section of the under layer fabric torn out and just ragged edges and stuff. For some reason, related to someone else, I kept saying we've got to get to the church. The Wedding Mass was supposed to start at 1:00 pm and it was just twenty minutes til. They said, no problem. It will only take us ten minutes to get there. We'll be there ten minutes ahead of time and you're all ready anyway. So it's not a problem. But something happened and we didn't leave. Now it was just ten minutes til and they said, that's alright. We'll still get there on time. Then it was five til and we hadn't left yet. Then it was five after. Then it was twenty after."
"1085"	"(2005-05-28)"	"I had invited 10-12 past clients to my home to view a movie related to dreams and then we were going to discuss it afterwards. I was wearing a sweatsuit (which I almost never do in waking life) and sitting sideways in my favorite chair with my legs hanging over the arm. It was getting close to the time I said we would start and no one was there yet. Someone finally came in the front door without knocking and everyone came in behind them. I was surprised at some of the people who showed up. We started the movie. I heard something going on upstairs. maybe Matthew up there making a bunch of noise. I got up to go up and take care of it. Halfway across the living room I realized I had taken my sweatpants off and didn't have any underwear on either. I hoped my sweatshirt was long enough so no one could see anything. It seems like I had to do this at least twice. The second time I had underwear on but still no sweatpants. When I came back down the movie was over already. It had only been an hour long. I was saying something about this to everyone, that I didn't remember it being so short, that I was disappointed not to have seen much of it with them but that I had seen it before. Everyone got up to leave. I said I thought we were going to discuss it. I don't know if they said why they were leaving or not but everyone left. "
"1086"	"(2005-05-28)"	"We were at some kind of outdoor picnic. I had spoken to Jody S a couple of times, noticing that she gotten her hair cut, even shorter than mine, but I didn't say anything. It looked really cute. I finally walked up behind her and put my hand on the back of her hair and told her how much I like it. Now she is standing in front of me. She is holding a paper plate with picnic food on it. I asked her if she cut her hair because of the wedding and she said, I'll teach her to try to tell me how to wear my hair."
"1087"	"(2005-05-28)"	"I was helping to prepare for a family wedding. it may have been Kim H's. We were at my birth home. On Friday before the wedding there were a bunch of us that were going to help decorate for the reception. There were a lot of clear plastic shoe boxes that had the various items for decorating in them. KIM was lying on the living room floor. I said something to her about decorating and she got up. On Saturday, we had cookies piled everywhere in the kitchen. Some were in various kinds of containers, on cookie sheets, serving trays, and plates. Because there were so many, most of us were eating one now and then as we went about preparing for the wedding. There was one cookie that was probably 16 inches in diameter and another that was maybe 10 inches in diameter. There were several women in the kitchen and we were trying to organize these cookies so they would be easier to take to the reception and easier for people to select from. It seemed that I was sneaking the ones I was eating so no one would notice. We had the kitchen table covered with empty cookie sheets. Chris H was out there and helping me to arrange them so they weren't piled on top of each other and would be easier to use. However, others of us realized very quickly that we would not be needing them at all. We are standing by some kind of a counter that has open shelving beneath it. I see two containers that I pull out and put on top of the counter. BJ comes along and puts them back on the lower shelves. I ask her about it. She said they are some kind of very thin, very heavy pancake type thing and they aren't really a dessert. that when people eat one of those they typically eat nothing else. I wasn't sure why she brought them. The weather outside is very cold. There are two buildings where the reception is being held. We are setting up the food in one of the buildings. It's fairly cold in the buildings and the weather isn't that great. We're worried that people won't show up because of the weather. Someone is setting up play activities for the children around the perimeter of the property. I thought this was odd. They were going to have a young person at each activity to watch the children but I still wondered if the parents would allow that if they weren't with them. So it might keep the parents from enjoying the reception. I was looking out a window at one of the activities and concerned about it for some reason. It was something that the children would slide through. kind of like a water slide but with no water. Later I looked out and saw snow on the ground and thought about the children sliding through it and landing in the snow. They would be dressed for a wedding not for this type of activity. We were talking about the fact that not many people were showing up. The bridal party had still not arrived from the church so I knew we didn't need to be concerned yet about getting to the reception building for dinner. I sat down and was looking at a pile of shoes wondering if I could find a comfortable pair of shoes that would look okay. One was a pair of flat, ankle-high, suede, black boots with a ribbon tie. There was also pair of regular, black, flats. I said I wanted something that my new insoles would fit into. I showed one of the insoles to BJ and asked her if she knew how much they cost. She shook her head no and I said $90. I was upset about the cost because I hadn't asked the doctor about the cost when he gave them to me and then my insurance wouldn't pay for them. BJ and I were changing clothes. She took off the jewelry she had been wearing and dropped it in my jewelry box. I was trying to decide what jewelry I wanted to wear. I picked up two different necklaces and asked BJ if they were mine or hers. Both times she said they were hers. The second time I said, really? She said yes. I apologized for doubting her, but that I thought I had purchased something very similar not very long ago. I put a necklace on and had four other things in my hand, two of which were earrings. I was trying to hold all of these things while I put the earrings on. Then I picked up a brooch and held it against my label. It matched the necklace and earrings but I was trying to decide if it was too much. Someone said that a lot of people were showing up now so we decided we better hurry and get to the reception, even though they said the wedding party had not yet arrived. There were children playing at the different activities that had been set up. I was sitting with some of my siblings at a table and we were just chatting. I asked Brian F if he had his hair colored again. He said no. I knew he was lying because part of it was very dark black and one section was very blonde. It looked like a punk-rocker style. This would not surprise any of us with Brian F but I didn't know why he was denying it. I challenged him a little so he told me what he had really done. He had apparently become very intrigued with some alternative religion. The change in his hair had something to do with that. He was telling us some of the philosophies that he liked about this religious leader. I asked him if he was still Catholic and he said, yes, absolutely. I wondered what that meant if he was now so involved with this other group. It felt kind of cultish to me and I was concerned. He said something about the people in this group being the most spiritual people he knows. I got angry. I stood up and started to walk away and with what I'm sure was a glare in my eyes looked back over my shoulder at Brian F and said, I take serious offense to that. I said something else as I turned back around and continued to walk away. I felt the tension that I had created for everyone involved in the discussion and felt bad about that. I wished I could not have been offended by Brian F's comment and wished I would have known how to handle it better."
"1088"	"(2005-06-06)"	"BJ had gone to Bob W's house and picked up his telephone answering machine and some audio tapes. We were in the kitchen of my birth home listening to them. She didn't seem to think he would mind her borrowing them. I don't remember why she borrowed them. I was standing just inside the screen door. Outside seemed like someplace else. Bob W was outside. He walked by close enough to have heard part of a recorded message that BJ had played from his answering machine. I saw his head perk up. as the message got his attention. A few seconds later he walked by again. This time it was intentional as he was trying to figure out what was going on inside. He finally walked up to the screen door. As he approached I opened the door. He extended his hand and introduced himself. He didn't realize that I already knew who he was. There was something else following that about the tapes. Then I am in a very messy, cluttered, bedroom. There is stuff everywhere. There were two beds in the room. One of the beds is where BJ had been sleeping with Bob W. I was going to have to sleep in the other bed for a night. I was upset about this and didn't want to. Nonetheless, I was trying to clean it up a little bit. There was now another woman. She was somehow involved with Bob W also. I don't know that BJ even suspected it. I am now walking through the house, though I don't know which house, and I tell John Bruce, a decorator on TV, that I wanted to show him this room that I think would be really great to makeover. It is kind of a sun porch. very rustic looking. But it is full of boxes and clutter. It's very messy. As we were walking to the room he was behind me and he put his arm forward and around the front of my waist and pulled me backwards against him. I think he made some kind of flirtatious comment to me. The woman that I was with earlier was in the house also and she had been continuing to make advances toward me though I was trying to put her off and not encourage it at all as I was not interested. She is now John's partner. though I don't know if they are married. She asks me if I would enjoy being part of a threesome with her and John and I tell her no. But perhaps I wasn't emphatic enough or clear enough because she then mentions it to John and he tries to convince me as the three of us step into a room and he closes the door behind me. We are the only ones in the room."
"1089"	"(2005-06-12)"	"Matthew and I were doing something in his closet here at home and I noticed what appeared to be an opening into what might be an attic. Neither of us had noticed it before. I pushed the piece of wood that was covering the opening up a little bit and peered in. It was very dark. I decided to climb up there and see if there was anything up there. As I got further up there I realized that I had known about it. that I had forgotten that I even put a lot of stuff up there to store. It was a very large well-lit room and there was a lot of stuff up there. Lots of furniture and boxes and other stuff. I noticed several different antique pieces of furniture. There were some other people up there with me. I pointed out a couple of the antiques and said we could take those back downstairs and I could use them instead of buying the pieces I had been thinking about buying. At least two of them could be used as a dresser in the guest room though that was not their original use. I realized that I could also enter this space from ground level outside. maybe through my garage. I was going in and out this way now. "
"1090"	"(2005-06-12)"	"I was with some other people on a cruise ship that was either being refurbished or had just been refurbished. I was not a guest on the ship. I was there in some professional capacity."
"1091"	"(2005-06-18)"	"I was at home and found a round table that used to belong to Mother and Daddy. I thought to myself that I still have quite a few pieces of furniture to refinish before I purchase any more to do."
"1092"	"(2005-06-19)"	"I walked into a room and there was a group of very-large, monstrous looking men. Each were lying on a table. as if to be examined by a doctor. None of them had genitals. The men all had appearances that were unkempt, unusually large, and disfigured to different degrees. Some of them looked more like characters out of a cartoon. At first I was afraid, but one of them approached me and began to talk to me and I realized how gentle he was. He explained that society had made them outcasts out of fear and because they are different. They had been forced to live under the city. I began to spend some time with them and realized that the only time they even hinted to anyone at being violent is if they felt that someone they cared about was threatened or in danger. At times I felt like I was watching a movie in which Sandra Bullock was the female lead, playing a character named Rose. At other times it felt as though I was Rose. One of the men asked Rose to perform fellatio on him. She didn't want to but reluctantly agreed out of pity for him and recognizing the human need for love and affection. Then others asked her the same thing. One man kept trying to rest his ahead against me as she did this and I kept trying to push him off. Someone was after me and I was trying to run away before they saw me or could catch me. My feet felt like lead. I could hardly move. I wanted to lift my arms so I could use my hands to grab things and help propel me forward but I couldn't. Some of these men blocked the path of whoever was chasing me and allowed me to get away. This happened several times. Sometimes I seemed to be in a dark parking garage and I was descending wooden ladders. The wood planks began falling off and I would sometimes slide down to the next level and other times fall. There was always someone below telling me to come ahead and I would be okay. At one point there were two other women that I knew. We were all three dressed in costume. I was trying to come up with something last minute. I had nothing on from the waist up except that I had put on a belt and placed a bunch of long stemmed flowers in the belt so they would cover my breasts. There was some kind of contest going on and each of us had to walk in front of the crowd as a model would. I was still trying to get all of my flowers in place when they called me. One of the girls had on a costume that made her look like some kind of a brown animal, but I remember having a very negative feeling about it when I looked at it."

"1094"	"(2005-07-01)"	"I was living in my condo. There was a group of about six other women that I knew from the neighborhood. Susan J was one of them. The rest of them I can't identify as women I know in waking life. They had spread out a big blanket very near my front door. It almost seems as though it was directly in front of my front door. They were having a pitch-in picnic. I went out the front door and saw them all sitting there. One of them said something about not being able to get in touch with me. I think they said they sent me an email and I hadn't responded. I told them I had been on vacation for the last ten days and had not been checking my email. So I didn't know about it. But that was okay. Then we were all inside and talking about various things. It seems like my house is just it seems like they had been in my house. The living room in particular was in complete disarray. All of the cushions were off of the sofa. One of the women's daughters had a birthday I think. So there were a lot of gift bags. small, little, girly gift bags. They had things like princesses and Disney characters. female Disney characters like Belle from Beauty and the Beast. I was trying to get my house back in order. Put the cushions back on the sofa. I kept moving these bags around from one spot to another to get them out of the way. While I was doing it, I was looking at Susan J and noticing how much weight she had lost. She was really thin. maybe a size 8. I've never seen Susan J thin. I said something to her about her weight loss and how good she looked. She said something about it being mostly because she had been sick. I thought to myself that as much as I want to lose weight and be thin again I don't want to do it by being sick. I looked at her again once or twice and realized that from the waist down she was still the same size that she had been. We were talking and she gave me a hug. She said the two of us need to spend a girl's weekend together. I said that would be really great, that I would really enjoy that. We continued doing something. I thought what would be really great would be to spend a weekend at a spa and just be pampered all weekend with massages, manicures, pedicures, facials, etc. I told her that I had the perfect idea for our girls weekend. There were other people around so I didn't want to say anything else right then. Plus, I hadn't thought enough about it to be able to suggest a specific place that would be affordable. I knew there was a place in town and it could still be a weekend getaway if we stayed there. As soon as I had a chance and was getting ready to tell her and she pulled out a brochure that was about day spas. One of them was in town. She said, here's what we should do for the weekend. I was so excited that she had the same idea. I said, yeah. And we could get a hotel room so it would still feel like a weekend getaway. get away from phones and TV's and computers and everything."
"1095"	"(2005-07-01)"	"People I can't identify. Decided to ride two or three things. Someone left the group and got on a ride. Everyone else followed. I got separated from the group and was upset that I didn't get to go. Walking to another ride with the whole group. Explaining to Daddy about one of the rides. Before we finished explaining he got on this slide leading to a hard-plaster, round, children's pool not knowing that the slide would land him there and in water. He went down and completely under water. He came up right away. Of course he was completely soaked. He had on a white shirt and tie. Two of us quickly wrapped him in two blankets. We had him sit in a red wagon that we had with us. He barely fit and sat with his knees to his chest. "
"1096"	"(2005-07-04)"	"I was at SVSDC with someone that worked there. Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone walk behind me to my left to go into the sleep center. I took a couple of steps backwards and looked to my left to see who it was. As I did, the person stopped and turned around. It turned out to be Doctor C. He came back towards me. We were standing there chatting for a little bit. I raised my right hand and placed it on his right cheek and brushed it lightly with my thumb. I told him how good it was to see him, that I missed him. While I was doing this, I realized that it might seem odd to the person I was with. I wondered what they would think but quickly decided that I didn't care what they thought. As we continued to talk I noticed that he had let his hair grow very long. He had a beard and mustache. He looked kind of scraggly. As we continued to talk I realized that his facial hair was just on half of his face. I thought that was very odd and wondered why he was doing that. Was it just some kind of rebellion against the hospital? Later I see him again. Now he is clean- and has his hair cut short again. He looked very good. Again, we're standing and talking. I put my hand on his cheek again and tell him how good he looks and make a comment about how soft his skin is. I told him I liked the look so much better than the last time I saw him, that I think he looks better without facial hair. Still later he is divorced. It's just the two of us. No one else is around. He leans in to kiss me and I turn my head for him to kiss me on the cheek. He tries again to kiss me on the lips. I take a step back because it feels inappropriate to me. I find out later that he is divorced. When I see him the next time he tries again to kiss me and I let him, but still feel surprised that I'm kissing him. We go to a number of events together. We attend an event at the sleep center together. Brandy C is there and being very flirtatious with him. She really doesn't like it that he and I are engaged to be married. I get the feeling that she is trying to break up our engagement. I feel good that he is not interacting with her at all. He doesn't want anything to do with her. He's being polite, but nothing more. Then we go to a party. I think it's an engagement party. It's in an outdoor pavilion. It has numerous square cement columns about six feet apart from each other. They are connected at the top with a cement beam. They form a grid-like pattern with openings in-between. There are a lot of openings in the overhead. It's evening. I notice a man by himself over to one side. I ask Doctor C if that's his dad. He said it was. I hadn't met him yet. I go over to introduce myself and chat with him. Doctor C followed me. He was very nice, very warm and welcoming. He welcomed me to the family. There are a number of employees there from the sleep center. There was something about a patient showing up at the sleep center and someone having to go to work. The employee needed something that wasn't there. I don't know if it was equipment, information, another person, or what. Now we are at the outdoor pavilion again. Doctor C's sons seem to be in their early twenties, old enough to be on their own. They may or may not have finished college but they no longer live with him. Ben C shows up and is very angry about his parent's divorce and Doctor C's relationship with me. He pulls out a gun and shoots Doctor C and he also accidentally shoots his own brother. An ambulance arrives and puts them both on gurneys and takes them to the hospital. I see that Doctor C is in a lot of pain as they lift him onto the gurney. They both had a full recovery. Ben C was very remorseful and went to therapy. Both boys ended up being very good, well-adjusted young men. They were involved in some kind of sport. It was an oval track with mild hills. They jump on it and speed around, but I don't see them actually jump on anything to propel themselves around the track. Ben C is excellent at this sport and has won many competitions. Jeff C, his brother, is very good but not quite as good as Ben C. He was determined to beat his brother and eventually does. at least once. That's all very exciting. We enjoy watching their competitions. We are back at the pavilion. One of the times we're there the employees are there with their children. Doctor C and I are talking to the children. We're just having a really nice time and establishing some very good relationships with these people and their children. At one point it seems that I am one of the employees, an African-American woman. who has a couple of children. There is another African-American woman who is a friend a co-worker. I'm flying. One time it seems that I just decide to fly to get someplace that I'm going. I decide to fly because I don't want anyone to try to stop me. I'm dragging something behind me like a tail trailing behind me. I'm trying to make sure I'm high enough in the air that no one on the ground can grab it. There is a child running along the ground trying to grab it but he isn't successful. One time when I'm flying I'm the black woman. It seems that I've created something like a slingshot where a rubberband is attached at two points at the top of these columns. I stand inside the rubberband and put myself as close to the ground as I can. I keep my feet braced against the wall or the columns. When I release my feet I propel forward. It seems like this is some kind of competition. My rubberband either keeps coming loose or breaking. One of my coworkers is going to watch my children while I do this. "

I went out after dark and used my remote to spot and unlock my car. Then I got in car and left. I'm back at the WDF office. Told Rich P to get down on floor to hide and told him about the limo outside. He thought it was there for him and had something to do with gambling debts. He apologized for putting me in danger. I tried to go out and leave but the limo was right next to my car. There were several men standing around. One was a black man. He was leaned on the driver's side door trying to hand me a gun. I was trying to get myself and Rich in the car so we could get away. I started shooting and accidentally shot two people I shouldn't have, people that were with me. They were taken to a hospital and survived as the bullet wounds were not life-threatening. I still felt like I was threatened or in danger. "

I had saved a center and an aisle seat on the right side of the bus about 2 or 3 rows from the front. I put a yellow piece of paper with my name in large letters in the aisle seat. When I came back someone had moved the sign back two rows and sat where my sign was. Someone I was with was going to say something to him but I told him it wasn't that important. I went back and took the other seat. After we left I noticed that the entire row across from where I had originally wanted to sit was empty so I moved up there and laid down on my back across the row, with my knees up. The bus driver said something to me related to being okay with not getting my original seat. I told him this worked out much better."
"1099"	"(2005-07-11)"	"I was at some kind of a not-for-profit organization doing volunteer work. There were quite a few of us. We had to do community service because of traffic violations we had each received. The place was very dirty and messy. It seems that maybe it is a homeless shelter like it as the people there are all unkempt. Melissa J was there. She said something very brief to me and I acknowledged what she said with a look and maybe a nod of my head. We were getting ready to leave and I noticed an arc shaped tear about 2 inches long in the upper right leg of my jeans. Someone told me that I should go tell one of the supervisors about it. I guess they thought the organization would reimburse me for the ripped jeans. I dismissed it initially because it was such a small tear and I felt responsible for it anyway. We had to go see the supervisors to check out. When we reached the counter the person I was with something about my jeans. When I looked down they now had three very large, straight, vertical tears. One was right in the side seam. One was around the pocket and the other was about two inches further towards the front. Two of the tears were about 12 or more inches long and the other was a few inches shorter."
"1100"	"(2005-07-12)"	"I was in bed. It was morning. There were people in the house. I had forgotten that they were coming early this morning or I didn't think ahead about being prepared if they showed up before I had gotten up. I was sleeping in the nude and concerned that Rachel S might come up and climb in bed with me as she often does when she stays with me. I opened the drawer of my beside table. I thought I might be able to grab pajamas and put them on quickly. I couldn't find them. Normally they are on top of everything else in that drawer. Then I'm someplace else but still in bed and nude. I don't know where I am but there are a lot of other people around. Some man comes in. He is very short in stature and small framed. Some might describe him as mousy. He lies down on the bed and starts having a conversation with me. I pulled the sheet covering me tight around me and tucked it under my legs and such so there would be absolutely no way that he could look under the sheet. As we're talking he mentions a previous discussion we had. I said I normally don't wear anything to bed. He looked at me as if to say with his eyes, so I know you're naked under that sheet and I think I'll peek. I double-checked to make sure the sheet was secure around me."
"1101"	"(2005-07-16)"	"[problem with audiotape] why he is saying it. Doesn't finish the sentence and something about scores [not sure what that last word was but that's kind of what it sounded like] as we leave and walks out. I don't know if he's coming back or not so I decide to turn off the lights and leave. there's a woman that had been talking to Bryan N. I knew who she was and knew that Bill C knew her as well. I had a suspicion that Bill C was hiring her to replace me. She was wearing a very, very short skirt, a see-through blouse and very high heels. She was tall and thin with short black hair. I was very upset that Bill C would be hiring her to replace me. I am walking out to the parking lot and this girl is walking out as well with someone else she knows. They keep ____around them and I go ahead and get in my car to leave. There are big piles of dirt all over the place. I'm wondering if I can just drive over one of the smaller piles, out through the circular drive that I normally come in on. I tried once and I almost got stuck. I backed up and tried again in a different place that was much higher. and I got really scared for a second. I was leaning forward in the car and kind of bouncing forward to try to keep the car from tipping over backwards and landing on it's roof. The car did come back down and land safely on the wheels. I decided I just needed to go out the other way. I got turned around and ready to do that and saw someone else do the same thing that I did except it was back in the corner of the parking lot where I always parked. He wasn't as lucky. His car crashed down and____came off the car and slammed back down. Oddly, the man that was in it was able to get out and walk away, though he was walking. Somebody was walking behind me. It's as if he is talking to himself but he wants me to hear him. He said, okay. How much can___something that they knew they shouldn't have done to begin with and all that kind of thing. He's just going on and on and I finally turn around and ask him if he wants a ride somewhere. He said yes, so I agreed to give him a ride____ home. ____was there, Bill C and to help them get along without me. I have a lot of mixed feelings about doing this. I'm very irritated by this, thinking that if they really needed me then they shouldn't have fired me. I'm trying to be nice and helpful, remembering that part of the agreement for the severance pay was that I would be available for one month to answer questions and help with the transition____down beside me. I'm facing one direction. He's facing the other. He crouches down, kind of ____anyway. He's saying something. I'm not sure how I feel about it anyway. He's saying something to me and someone else. He's been having trouble accessing some of the files on my computer____ message and even though I___he occasionally gets a message saying that it isn't. I finally told him that I could send him a copy of the disc that I brought home with me if that would help. He said, Could you? You wouldn't mind doing that? I said, No. I'll do that. It will take me some time to find it because everything is still in boxes and I haven't done anything with it. I'll get it to you. In my head I'm thinking. I'm pretty sure I'm going to take the personal stuff off of those CD's before I make the copy to send to him. I'm not going to send him anything with files or documents related to me on it. Well, maybe I'll just go ahead and send them to him but then I thought, No. The way he just leaves CD's laying around all over the place I wouldn't want someone else to have access to them. Now he says, Really? You wouldn't mind? He's standing up and leaning forward with his hands resting on his knees_____and laundry. I'm trying to fold this laundry and trying to have room to put it in different piles based on what room it goes in. I'm wondering why no one is helping. I need to leave so I'll finish folding it for you but you have to put it away. There was another woman around____ by all means they would get it put away____ to me and somebody else____ but it was a for your head. There was a big V torn in the front. She was walking____ something to do outside our office or somehow she was trying to hold us responsible for fixing it. So I was messing around with it, seeing if I might be able to repair it. While I was, I continued to talk with a gentleman____ kept talking to her and asking her questions. We finally realized that we weren't at all responsible for this and we confronted her about that. She admitted that she had lied to us and she knew we weren't responsible. She was just looking for a way to get it repaired at no cost to her."
"1102"	"(2005-07-18)"	"Bill C had asked me to come into the office to help him with something as part of our agreement to make myself available to him through August 5th. When I arrived there seemed to be quite a few people around, a lot going on. Bill C was in his office with someone with the door closed. I noticed through the glass by his door that he seemed to be having a good time. This was upsetting to me because he would never allow himself to have a good time working with me. I had the feeling that he was interviewing someone to replace me even though he had said he was eliminating my job. Later he was in his office with the door closed again with someone else and again it seemed that he was really enjoying himself. It's odd that so often I told him I wanted to do what I could to help him enjoy the business and yet he seemed determined to make me miserable. The landlord had started a new program to spotlight one of it's tenants each month by planting a tree outside the building and putting up some type of weather proof sign, 8 _ x 11, talking about the business. CAS was being highlighted that month and, surprise, surprise, Bill C was not happy with his sign. He asked me to make some changes to it and then put the new one in its place. After I placed the new sign I was walking to my car to leave the office. Jane C came up behind and began to walk with me and talk to me. I got the impression that she shared my perspective more than Bill C's but we both knew she needed to be careful of what she actually said to me. On the property there was some kind of outdoor vendor that sold some very unusual food item that was apparently the hot item. Everyone was talking about how fabulous it was. Jane C suggested we go get one and talk further. It involved ice cream and something people would not normally put ice cream on and it was something you could carry with you to eat. It was almost like an ice cream cone with some normal food but nothing you would ever see in an ice cream cone and then a scoop of ice cream on top. As we were walking, Bill C joined us and began talking to me about something else he wanted me to do. I was very frustrated and upset with him and I didn't want to do anything else, especially just now. It seems that later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw him approaching me again. I pretended not to have seen him and tried to hurry to my car to get away before he reached me but I wasn't successful. Jane C and I went into the city together. At times we were walking but at times both of our cars were there. She saw a friend of hers and waved her down saying that we needed her help. We walked with her friend to what I thought was her home but later realized was a hotel with apartment-like rentals. She was on the second floor and there was no elevator. The flight of steps was divided into three sections, each one 90 degrees different than the one before. The first step on the first flight wasn't at floor level as steps would normally be. We had to grab on to the handrail and lift one leg very high to get on the first step. Even then the first two flights of steps were more like thin slats turned on their side. Jane C's friend said this was supposed to be safer than normal steps. The slats appeared to be a clear acrylic or heavy glass with a neon green effect to them. As you looked down through the slats you could see grey concrete with lots of litter and dirt on it. The third flight was more like normal steps and a brown covering on them. After we had gotten to the woman's apartment we decided to go out for a cocktail. A couple of times Jane C said something about Bill C not knowing where she was but she didn't seem to have any intention of letting him know. It was dark outside and the city streets were lined with cars, though there weren't many people around. We felt uncomfortable with a particular group of young men we saw headed toward us. We went in somewhere and had a drink. We are now running through establishment after establishment to get away from these men as they are chasing us. It's as though all of these businesses are connected with one long hallway but a door to pass from one to the other. Sometimes the door was a swinging door and easy for us to pass through. Other times there were people in the way and other times we tried to open the door in one direction only to find out it opened in the other direction. Now we are in a car trying to get away from them and they are following us by foot. Jane C is driving. I say to her, Let's fly. I know we aren't dreaming, but if we are it would work to get away. I thought for a moment about how we could make ourselves fly, or how we would do it in a dream. We would just decide to fly and we would. For a few seconds I thought about this wondering if these two women were actually having this same dream but realizing that in waking life Jane C is not someone I could ask such a question to and I don't even know the other woman. Jane C decided to try flying and wished the car to take off like an airplane and it did. One of the men latched on to the back of the car and was dangling from the rear of the car. I was trying to knock him off. We go back to the woman's apartment. We are upset and tired and each decide to take a shower and then all three of us sleep there. Jane C decides she is not going to let Bill C know where she is until morning. I have at times questioned the type of marriage they have and this seemed to support my questioning. I was thinking about how it felt for me to be spending this time with Jane C. I was surprised that we seemed to connect in a meaningful way. She really seemed not just to get what I was thinking and feeling about the whole work situation but that she seemed to agree with me. She came out of the shower wearing a deep yellow bathrobe and had a lighter yellow towel wrapped around her head. We were standing very near each other, face-to-face, and were talking. I decided to go home. The other woman decided to walk with me to my car. It wasn't close to the hotel. It seems as though we began to be chased again."
"1103"	"(2005-07-21)"	"I was at the CAS office. I had been in my office talking to some man and had my door closed. After he left Bill C came into my office to talk about something. He was very angry. He suddenly realized that something was bothering me and he said something about it. Then he said something to the effect that he was going to regret asking. We went to the copy machine and continued talking. We started talking about what was bothering me after returning to my office and closing the door. People kept coming in without knocking. Finally, one of us almost slammed the door shut and locked it so we could continue our conversation without further interruption. Finally we did talk through it. Part of the conversation was the acknowledgement of the warmer side of our relationship. I think this was my last day and before this conversation started I was just trying to figure out how to get through the day with no more problems with him or anybody else for that matter. When we finished the conversation, after we both acknowledged the more positive, warmer side of our relationship I asked him if I could have a hug this time rather than our traditional handshake. He immediately reached to give me a hug. He also gave me a quick friendship kind of kiss on the lips. It felt as though he was holding the hug for a long time. Since my door was closed when the other man was in there I wondered if Bill C was suspicious of why he was in there or who he was and maybe felt a bit envious. Maybe that's why he was mad. After completing my talk with Bill C I was in my office with someone else and had the door closed. A couple of IT men came in to work on my computer and they didn't knock first. They could tell that I was only partially dressed and trying to get the rest of my clothes on. They couldn't see any more than that. I was crouched down behind my desk trying to get dressed. They went around me to try to work on my computer. They were joking around and telling me my secret was safe with them and stuff like that. There was a window next to my office door that looked out into the hallway or the reception area. They had vertical blinds on them. One of them kept going over. I kept thinking that I wanted him to stop that so people wouldn't see me, see what I'm doing, see that I'm not fully clothed. One time when he walked away there were big gaps between the slats of the blinds. I finally finished dressing. My office was in terrible disarray. The computer men had moved things all over the place. I was trying to get things put back. There were two silk trees. They had placed them on top of my desk. One of them would stand by itself. I was trying to remember where I had it before where it had something to support it. First I tried it in the corner and I realized that wasn't working. Then I moved it next to my desk and tried to use the trash can to support it. That worked. It was a very strange looking silk tree. It was mostly trunk. At the top were just a few very dark, shiny, green, medium size leaves. The other one I think was a Fichus tree. I put it in the corner and continued putting other things back. A female coworker came in and was talking to me. And a black woman came in who also worked for the same company. She came in with a big smile on her face. She said to the other woman, That's my girl! She also told her that this was my last day there. She said she was sorry to hear that. to see me go. She could tell that I was sad so she started trying to cheer me up. Saying things like this was a good thing for me, I'd be going back closer to my family, and that maybe I'll even decide to get more education. I gave her a look of surprise. She asked why the look and I said because I am so close to completing my Ph.D. and I can't imagine wanting more formal education. At least not for a long time."
"1104"	"(2005-07-22)"	"I went back to the CAS office for something computer-related. Everyone was there. At first I think didn't really care if he was comfortable or not. Then he said something from the other room about all of us going to lunch together as a better way to get closure on my leaving. I thought, that's fine. Now, he wants to go to lunch. (Bryan N) As opposed to when he first came back to the company I invited him to lunch and he didn't accept my invitation. I just said no and that I didn't think it was necessary. I was doing something a newsletter almost ready to go before I left. It just needed Bill C's final approval. I wasn't happy with a couple of the pictures. I had come in and edited those pictures and was going to replace them. I was having problems with the computer. Then I realized that the replacement pictures didn't look any better than the original. It seems as though in two of the pictures I was either trying to person in each of the pictures up with another person. There is a very thin line around each person. Like the one that I put in was just a fraction smaller than the one I was covering up so you could see the edges of what I was trying to cover up on both of them. I finally gave up and decided to keep the originals in. Bill C came in and I told him why I was there. I asked him if the newsletter had gone out yet. He looked at me like he didn't want to answer. But then he said no. He had something in his hand, stapled together. He was flipping through the pages and looking down at them while he talked to me. It didn't surprise me. He asked me if I would do it before I left. I was thinking that if he thought he didn't need me anymore he should just let Jennifer C do it. Jennifer C was kind of upset because she didn't know why I was there. I agreed to do it, but then as I was, Jennifer C got mad because she didn't know why Bill C didn't just have her do it. I thought it was all just ridiculous. Then he ended up getting mad because I was there. He walked out of the office. He was going to the men's room. I followed him to the lobby. He's really angry. With his back to me in a very angry voice he asked what it was going to take to get rid of me. I was so hurt but thought he needed to be this way to make himself feel okay about letting me go. I grabbed his arm and said, you know, our relationship was so complex and intense. I just can't leave like this. I can't just part and leave things like this. By the look on his face I felt like he knew that and felt the same way but he just either couldn't allow himself to say that or to agree with me or maybe it was even something else. It seems to me that there was a legal issue involved. Jane C was there with both of us at different times or at the same time. I don't know. Now we're all leaving the office at the same time. It's dark outside. It's winter. The parking lot is very slick, though not a solid layer of ice. Jane C said something to Bill C about walking slowly so he wouldn't fall and get hurt. Just as she said that I ran a few steps and then slid. I was turned at an angle with one foot slightly in front of the other and sliding fast and a good while. As I was sliding, I said there was nothing to stop me. I decided to just change my direction and slide off into the grass. Before I could do that a man from our group came up beside me grabbed my arm and stopped me. Bill C and the others started sliding. Bill C did a front flip the way a gymnast might. He landed on the grass sitting up with his arms behind him holding himself up. It looked like he had hurt himself but he didn't want to admit it. He just sat there for a minute then shook it off. "
"1105"	"(2005-07-24)"	"Darren had taken a shower and broken either the inner shower rod or torn the inner shower curtain. He didn't say anything about it or do anything about it. He just left it that way for me to find and take care of. When I went to take a shower I found it and had to take care of it before I could take a shower. I had to take both curtains and rods down and put the inner curtain on the outer rod and just leave the outer curtain down completely. I was very aggravated with him for doing this, for not saying anything and for just leaving it for me to take care of. It was so like him. I went to bed for the night, not wearing anything as usual. It was so hot, even though I had the air conditioning on and a fan on that I didn't cover myself even with a sheet. I saw Darren at my bedroom door. He paused for a moment and then I thought he was coming in to get in bed with me. I was extremely upset but when I tried to move or speak to prevent it I couldn't. This happened two or three times."
"1106"	"(2005-07-24)"	"I went to Cleveland to interview for a job at Fifth Third Bank. I was alone and not sure of the directions. There was road construction along one of the streets or maybe an exit ramp from the highway. Where the construction was going on there was a long line of construction workers all facing the traffic, each just a few feet from each other, to make sure that all the cars went very slowly and that they did not get over to far towards the construction. I was looking down at the road in front of me and at the line of workers. I was watching very carefully. I noticed something about the pavement I was driving on and realized that this is why they were being so cautious and I wanted to make sure I complied. I went to a McDonald's to get something to drink. There was no drive through and only a few parking spaces total for customers use. Luckily one of them was open so I parked there. There were only four to six tables total in the restaurant. There was an order window inside the restaurant. I decided to order some french fries as well. While I was waiting I went to a restaurant next door to use the women room. The lobby area was very dark and the restroom doors were dark wood with dark brown signs and dark gold lettering on them. I didn't notice it at first but both the men's and the women's had two doors each. I was trying to read the signs for the men's room thinking that one said men and one said women but I couldn't make out which was which. I man came up and went in. I could see the walls inside. They were bright red. I realized then that both doors said men and then I spotted the doors for the women's room. Just as I turned to go into the women's room I saw two separate women go into the men's room. They went and ahead and stayed and used it before coming out. I had to pay my bill at the restaurant and then I went back to my car. I had decided to walk to the interview because I thought it was only three or four blocks. It was on 43rd street and I was on 39th at the time. I thought I just needed to walk down 39th street to my right for one or two blocks, turn left and walk to 43rd street and I would pretty much be there. As I walked I remembered that many of Cleveland's main streets go off at weird angles rather than all being right angles. This threw me and I wasn't sure which way to go now to get to the bank for my interview. As I kept walking I was in this narrow corridor with business buildings to either side of me. They were quite varied in appearance. Many of them had very shiny, contemporary exteriors. Several of them had very odd shaped and inset entryways to get to their doors. Some of the buildings were not typical square or rectangles but had odd angular shapes. I finally stopped two women and asked them for directions. They were locals but seemed to have difficulty giving me clear directions. I finally found the building for the bank. When I walked in it looked more like a very large round atrium in the very center of a huge department store. The atrium had displays and such in it as well but the ceiling went much higher than that of the first floor of the rest of the building. I was walking around the atrium looking for some sign of the bank. I finally saw something that looked like it might be a teller's window so I went up and asked someone. They called a woman to come and meet me. She took me into an elevator. I don't know what floor we got off on. When we got off you could see nothing but carpeted divider walls that were about six feet tall. The all seemed to be self-supporting carpet and did not have much structure or seem to have much stability to them. None were set at straight angles but rather curved and waved all around very much like a maze. I was feeling very nervous, claustrophobic, as the areas to walk between these carpet walls was very narrow. With them curving around as much as they did I had trouble keeping sight of the women I was following. She would look into an opening occasionally. I wasn't sure if she was looking for an open space for us to sit and talk or if she wasn't sure herself where she was going. I had the sense it was both. Once I lost her completely and got very panicky until I found an opening and saw some people. Then the woman I had been following showed up. She took me into an area that had two desks with three or four chairs at each desk. She sat me down at a desk where an older gentleman was sitting. He was also there applying for a job. A male employee of the bank then came in and sat down at began to interview both of us while the woman sat in the background. He asked the man about his education and experience then asked me to tell him about mine. I felt very self-conscious, as it seemed to make the other man very uncomfortable. I tried to play down both my education and my experience. Also, I didn't want them to be held against me in getting the job if they weren't going to be viewed as positive reasons for me to get the job. I began to hope that there was more than one position so we could both get a job. The woman and I then got up and walked to another area. It was much larger, more open and there were more people there. "
"1107"	"(2005-08-03)"	"I was with a group of people. Something had happened that was going to cause each of us to lose some of our teeth. We had been sitting and watching TV. As I was sitting there I was tapping on one of my teeth with something. It was shaped like a pencil but it was longer, larger around, and heavier. Suddenly the back two teeth in the upper left quadrant of my mouth began to crumble and fall out in pieces. I was catching the pieces with a napkin as they fell. They were discolored and bloody, but not messy bloody. You could just tell they had a little blood on them but the blood wasn't transferring to anything else, not dripping, not leaving a spot on the napkin. The others were watching and began to get upset knowing that this was going to be happening to them. A bit later I lost the back two in another quadrant. This happened to more times in the lower quadrants. Everyone was talking about it and upset that it was going to happen to them too and what it would be like and such. I was clicking my remaining teeth together to test how it felt. I told the others that it really wasn't that bad. We just wouldn't have those back teeth to chew with anymore. The more I paid attention to how it felt when I clicked my teeth together the less okay I was with the whole thing."
"1108"	"(2005-08-03)"	"I was with a group of people. We were working on something, it seems like papers with something on them. We kept making changes to be sure that we had each one either right or the best we could come up with."
"1109"	"(2005-08-03)"	"Garnet P called to see if I would be interested in selling Avon since she is retiring and moving to North (or South) Carolina. She was telling me all of the benefits and that they were also doing some kind of recruiting special right now. She was telling me about all of the things I would receive as a new recruit. We had a light-hearted conversation. I kept telling her I wasn't interested. I finally said I would give it some thought over the next few days and let know if I changed my mind. Mostly I was just trying to end the conversation."
"1110"	"(2005-08-04)"	"I had decided to go to the office to talk with Bill C. I went to the Norse Starbucks first to get some coffee. I was trying to remember where it was because it was fairly new and I had only driven by it. I remembered that it sat back off the street a bit and it was around NTNS. When I got there I pulled in and was trying to figure out where I was supposed to park. There was another coffee place right next to it. Their lots were connected with no divider of any kind. Before I parked several long lines of people had gathered outside of Starbucks. I was trying to back out without hitting anyone, though my car was surrounded by people. I was debating whether or not I really wanted to wait through those lines for coffee. Once I parked, the lines in front of Starbucks were gone and now there are long lines at the other coffee place. I thought the timing was very nice for me. I went in to Starbucks and ordered a mint, chocolate-chip, decaf, frappucino with skim milk and no whipped cream on top. When I got to the office Bill C was not there. I went into my old office and I was sorting out a bunch of booklets. the size of the IGTBE booklet, while I waited. Jennifer C came in and we talked briefly. It was cordial and I was warm, but not like before. A little bit later Bryan N came in to do something and acted like he didn't even see me. I said hello to him and he looked up and said hi. It felt awkward, but I was trying my best to make it feel like it was no big deal. The office layout was like the layout of my birth home. My office was where my bedroom was. We had our own bathroom where the bathroom was in the house. Bill C came into the office and went into the bathroom. I know he saw me. I was sitting at my desk. The right side of the desk was sitting against the back wall of the room. I had a full view of everyone that came and went from the bathroom, as they did me. When Bill C came out of the bathroom he headed away from my office. I called his name, twice. The second time he turned around and said something like, Oh, Anna. He came in and sat down in the chair in front of my desk like he always would. He asked me what I was doing. I said I was sorting these booklets while I was waiting for him, that I had always wanted to do it but had never gotten around to it. Then I told him why I had wanted to talk to him. I wanted us to part company on a better note, so it wouldn't be awkward in the future if we ever ran into each other. I don't remember what else either one of us said but he ended up getting aggravated and walking out of the room. I finished sorting the booklets and took them out to the reception area. They had created a circular display of workbooks. It was about three feet in diameter and about four feet tall. They had created four rows of booklets at the bottom, each coming out from the center of the circle. They had made numerous layers because there were so many of them. They alternated where the rows started on each layer so the display would be stable. I didn't think it was very stable though. I was very carefully placing the booklets on it and asking Jennifer C if I was doing it the way they wanted. She let me know that she had just done what Bill C had asked and the way he had asked. The display was right in front of her desk, which I also thought was an awkward place for it. not leaving much room to walk through from the door to the training room or other offices. The display was also on a turntable. "
"1111"	"(2005-08-04)"	"I was going to a baseball game. Ended up going in a limo with a bunch of black men that I didn't know. I got along well with one of them. Didn't know where my seat was and not sure I could find it. Wanted to sit with him. We got split up. It was an evening game and was about to end in a tie. They said if it ended in a tie they would play another nine innings. I was ready to go home and didn't want this to happen. I had brought a lot of stuff with me and was aggravated that I had. I had a briefcase, a purse, another similar kind of bag, and a jacket. It was annoying, cumbersome, and took too much space. I realized I didn't have my ticket with me and was very upset. An older gentleman walked by me and offered me a free ticket they weren't going to be using. He actually had four or five of them in his hand. They were a pinkish purple in color. I thought if I could have gotten two of these tickets and known in advance I could have brought Matthew along. He was a young boy in the dream. The ticket was for a seat in the section I was standing outside of so I didn't have trouble finding the section. I asked a few people who were seated where my seat was. They didn't seem sure either. A woman said that there were going to be lots of empty seats so I should just sit where I want. Ended up talking to people around me. Later a man sat behind and to my left and I began a conversation with him. Later a woman came and sat down next to him and then she leaned over and kissed him. I realized it must be his wife but I was surprised because she looked more like she would be his mother. I wondered how an attractive man like him would be married to someone that looked like his mother and yet I can't seem to meet anyone. A female friend of mine was now sitting there and talking primarily to me but the people around her were listening as well. She was telling me that she had gotten married. I was excited for her and said, Really? Is it the black man from the limo? She smiled sheepishly and said yes. That he had tracked her down later that evening and told her that he just knew they were meant to be together. and they've been together since. They had gotten engaged immediately and had a very short engagement. They've been very happy. I was wondering to myself why I had asked her if it was the black man. Why didn't I just say the man from the limo. I thought of Brian F and Latonya M and the fact that here is another example of a very happy interracial couple."
"1112"	"(2005-08-05)"	"I met with Bill C about my leaving. He asked me if there was anything I wanted to say. I hesitated for a few moments then said, yes there is, though I'll likely regret it. I began by talking about our working relationship for most of my first three years there. When I began to talk about the change that occurred during the last 8-10 months, he rolled his eyes, and lowered his head to rest in the palm of his hand as his elbow rested on the table. I asked him what that look was for or about. "
"1113"	"(2005-08-06)"	"I met Lilly H and Tonya H for breakfast. As they came in to the restaurant they were going to sit across the table from me. Each leaned over the table for a hug before sitting down. The table was wide so it wasn't much of a hug. As I did so with Tonya H I thought that probably wasn't very good for her and probably wasn't the best thing for my back. "
"1114"	"(2005-08-06)"	"I overheard Bill C telling the rest of the staff that he was doing away with the main web site and just going to keep the site with his name as the url. He was doing so because of his usual attitude toward the web. I had mixed feelings about this. I thought it was just as well if he wasn't going to maintain either of the sites."

"1116"	"(2005-08-09)"	"I was walking around the city of the city where I live. I went into 8 or 10 different buildings. To enter each one I had to climb a steep, high flight of stairs. Each flight of steps was very unusual. Some of the flights either seemed to be or actually were built higher than the typical twelve inches. At first glance, at the first two or three flights, I was a bit hesitant, wondering about the safety and if I would be able to climb them without falling or getting hurt. At some of the buildings there was someone at the top watching and saying something to me about the steps, in some cases telling me to be careful or saying that they really aren't that bad if you're just careful. In most cases each of the steps was partially rounded and open. The best description I can think of is the shape of the end of a medicine capsule, only partial. The rounded end was there and the bottom extended a bit further than the top part. In some cases the rounded end faced out and I had to step over the rounded end and into each step. In other cases they faced the other way and I had to step into each one. In most cases each step seemed to protrude a bit over the step below making me feel that I needed to be extra cautious. At least some of them also seemed that each step was slanted. down towards the back of the step. It's as though I had to step into each step, sometimes over and into. The steps were also very colors, some with a marble appearance in dark colors, other were white. None of them looked like typical steps in materials or colors that you would typically see. The last building I entered the steps led down into the building, though they were equally unusual. This flight had more of a feel of climbing down a rung ladder, though it seemed more sturdy than that. I would typically feel a little nervous about climbing down a tall, steep, rung ladder but I felt pretty confident about this one. The steps were white and the entryway seemed very well lit, bright and welcoming. An employee of the store was standing at the bottom cautioning me. This was a business that people bought memberships to frequent. They offered all types of audios that people could come in and listen to, but the audios could not be taken from the premises. Each room had comfortable seating for patrons to sit and listen to the audios. It was made up of numerous average-size rooms. Each room had a different topic of audios. There was something unusual about these audios, though I'm having trouble putting my finger on exactly what it is. One thing is that weren't made in any kind of format that we're used to seeing, CD, cassette, LP album. As I looked at the displays I noticed there seemed to be two or three different formats. Some did look similar to an LP album. Others were smaller, thicker square packages, but not like a CD or cassette. The topics were primarily not ones that you would find on audio. I think some of them, maybe most of them, were educational in nature. maybe audio books. When I entered some of the rooms I knew immediately I didn't want to listen to anything from that category and quickly left the room, sometimes not going further than to peer in or step into the room to see what the topic was. A woman that I know was there, though I don't know her in waking life, with her child. I thinking a daughter. We talked a bit about this business. I told her I had not known about it before now and I just happened upon it. I came into the building just to see what was here. I was very interested and happy to have found it, but disappointed that I had not found it before. I thought that there were probably few people who knew it existed. It seems that there is also a man there that I know, again I don't know him in waking life. On and off, I'm talking to each of them at separate times. One of them tells me about the membership. There is a small, rectangular, window-like opening along one wall. The opening has glass, or plexiglas part way down from the top, leaving an opening between the bottom of the glass and the lower sill of the window opening. The lower sill has a dark brown, wood shelf, about 12 inches deep and maybe 1 inch thick. There is a male employee behind the window and uses the opening to talk to members and potential members, or to pass documents back and forth. I go to talk to him, to get more information about membership. He tells me what paperwork he needs from me to be able to complete the application and I as I go through my purse I realize I don't have the information with me that he needs. He suggests a temporary membership and that I can bring the other information with me the next time. I'm still not sure what the cost of the membership is or if I should be spending my money on it right now. I'm trying to decide if this is something that I just want or if it will really be helpful to me right now. Now I'm talking to Jane C. We're talking a bit about my whole CAS experience. It seems that she sees things more from my perspective than Bill C's. I feel that she is definitely sympathetic and supportive of me. She is getting ready to leave and I ask her to wait just a second and I will walk out with her. I want to continue talking with her. At first she hesitates because she is meeting someone outside. I tell her it will really only be a second so she decides to wait. We have to climb back up to leave the building. This time the entry/exit seems darker than when I came in, though I don't think I noticed this in the dream itself. As we got outside Jane C began looking for her friend. At first she started to walk away thinking she would track her down but then she decided to stay for a bit. I'm facing many different streets, some running parallel to each other and others going off at angles in different directions. I can see down each street from where I am standing. I'm trying to remember where I parked my car, as I had been walking most of the day. I'm not sure I remember, and where I'm thinking it may be is quite far away and I'm feeling dismayed about having to walk that much further yet, to get to my car. The street running perpendicular to me is now somewhat rounded and has three or more lanes of traffic all heading in the same direction. heading to my right. The traffic becomes bumper to bumper just as the cars get in front of me. There are a couple of times that someone nearly gets rear-ended because someone is driving too fast and not paying attention. I realize that I need to cross this street to head towards my car and there is no crosswalk in sight. I'm standing there debating what to do. whether or not to try to cross this street in the midst of all this traffic. I see my brother Bob F drive up in a very funny, little, white vehicle. It's not a car really. It's something that he uses with his job at the park. At first I thought I could ask him to drive me to my car. Then I'm not sure I can get to him as he is in one of the middle lanes of traffic. I finally decide to at least get his attention. I call out to him two or three times before he hears me. He finally looks my way and I make a dash to his vehicle. As soon as I reach him I realize there isn't room for a second person, but he immediately pushes something behind him over and tells me to get on. It's a very small space. I would have to sit facing from the side of the vehicle with my legs dangling. I wasn't even sure I could fit in there. It was covered with some kind of delicate, pink fabric. There are some pearls similar lying on it or near it or under the fabric. I hesitate to sit. He needs to take off so I tell him I will just stand on the sideboard and hang on. The traffic is slow enough that I won't be in danger. So he takes off. There is now bumper-to-bumper traffic as far as I can see in every direction. There are also tons of people milling around. I realize that there is going to be a parade starting soon. I think I would enjoy watching it but contemplate trying to get to my car before it starts and watching it from there, rather than waiting until afterwards to walk all the way to my car. There are groups of young musicians standing around waiting to match in the parade. all dressed in bright, colorful uniforms. There are also a lot of buses parked everywhere. I suppose they transported the young musicians to the parade location. The buses have an almost graffiti like appearance to them. Most of them being a dark blue base paint with white graffiti. I'm trying to decide if it would be safe to walk between these parked buses, as the view from any one point would be so limited."
"1117"	"(2005-08-10)"	"I went to the CAS office. I was sitting in the building lobby talking with Jennifer C when Bill C came out of the office. He had a pencil behind his ear and was headed to the restroom. He looked at me, noticed me, but did not respond in facial expression or word as he walked past us. When he returned from the restroom he looked at me again and I told him that I had stopped by hoping to talk with him for a few minutes. I'm not fully sure how he responded but his response included a snide remark and indicated that he would talk with me, reluctantly, and that he was very busy. He may have just been saying he was very busy because he didn't want to talk with me. I was thinking that there really was no need for him to be so rude or to be so rude in what he says or how he says it. I followed him into the office. There was a lot of construction going on both in my old office and in his office. At first I thought he might be moving in to my old office but when I looked in it looked like he was having it set up for more than one person to work in there. The room was about twice the size as it is in waking life. I had no idea what they were doing in his office. I followed him into a room that was also in the midst of construction and a total mess. I'm not sure if it is one of the offices or another room. I can tell that he intends to continue doing what he was doing and listen while I talk. Another sign that he really didn't want to talk to me. I had decided to just drop in on him like this because he wouldn't answer my email request for a conversation. Just as I began to talk I noticed a hinged picture frame sitting on a piece of furniture behind Bill C and to his right. Both pictures are of multiple people, but I am in both. The back of the frame is red velvet and the front sleek, shiny gold, else nothing decorative. I went and picked up the frame and began to remove the pictures. As I did so I looked at Bill C and said, I'm guessing you no longer want pictures of me sitting around here. I wasn't sure how to interpret his response. that he did or did not want me to take them. At that time Bryan N came into the room to get something. He didn't say anything to either of us in an effort not to interrupt us. I noticed some other things sitting where the picture frame was and realized that they belonged to Bryan N. I have a visual from the dream that I have no idea what it is or where it belongs in the scene. The visual has three large brown things about the size and shape of elevator cars. They are stacked on top of each other. I'm standing at a distance and it seems that they may be sitting in the building lobby. Bill C is walking past them toward me."
"1118"	"(2005-08-12)"	"I'm painting my bedroom, using three shades of peach. A light shade on the ceiling, a medium shade on the walls and a darker shade on the trim. Someone is helping me. I'm very excited about how it turned out. Aunt H and Aunt P comes and looks at the room. Aunt H just smiles and doesn't say anything. I can tell Aunt P is not happy. As they walk away I realize that this is not my house and that I've painted a room in their house without asking them. I go to find them and am apologizing profusely. Aunt P doesn't seem to respond at all. Aunt H just smiles, as always. I tell them that I will repaint it right away. back to what it was. I tell Aunt H that I don't know what happened. what's wrong with me. I can't understand why I thought I was in my own house. I'm very upset by this. "
"1119"	"(2005-08-13)"	"I moved back into my condo, but it looked different than in waking life. The front of the building looked more like a city apartment building, with red brick facade and many small windows. The section of wall around my entrance was almost all windows, but they were small square windows, side-by-side, rather than larger ones that you would typically see. I was standing inside peering out through a window and I could see this wall full of windows. It was several stories high and I noticed how the window panes glistened. There were people I know helping me to move. We were talking about the condo and having lived there before, about some of the old neighbors, and about the differences in the condos or building facades. I remembered that there was an attic. There was a flight of steps. At the top of the steps was a closed door that led into the attic. I remember that Tom G and Shirley J used to live hear and wondered if all there was stuff was still up there. Darren was there. He and I had gotten into a disagreement about something and he decided to go up with me and see what was up there. I wondered if they were ever going to move back in here. Darren said they weren't and since it was his relative he owned it now. I told him I would call Tom G and talk to him. He didn't think I would but I did. Tom G told me he had already signed the deed over to me and Darren. He didn't know that we were divorced. I told him that I hadn't seen the paperwork so he said he would take care of it and make sure I got the paperwork. Darren was going to have to buy me out or turn his ownership over to me. I knew he couldn't afford to buy me out so he just turned ownership over to me. As I was going through the stuff in the attic I realized that Tom G had removed all of his stuff. Everything that was left either belonged to Shirley J or her parents. Darren was still up there going through things with me. I started organizing things up there. There were quite a few rooms to the attic and each one had things in it. I was gathering things from the various rooms and moving them all to one place. I intended to talk to Shirley J about it. A member of my family was up there with me and we were talking about the various things that were up there. particularly the old pieces of furniture. There were quite a few pieces up there that I really liked and would love to have. They belonged to Darren's parents. I wasn't sure that I wanted to offer to buy them or not. One room had some old sports memorabilia. There were two miniature bats laying on an open beam. the kind they used to give out at the ball games on Bat Day. I thought that Matthew would love to see those. or to have them. I pulled them down to take and show him. Tom G and Shirley J used to have a bedroom and bathroom on this floor. Their bathroom had a wonderful shower in it. I wondered about having it moved down one floor to my bathroom. I thought it would be worth it. Darren starts hassling me about it. I reached to turn on some of the knobs to see if it was working and kept getting sprayed. There were massaging water jets in several different places on the shower wall. The water sprayed out of one at a time randomly. I turned my head at one point and Shirley J was standing there with a smile on her face. At this point I was very wet. We talked a bit about the shower. It seemed that I would be able to have it moved downstairs and have it repaired. Tom G is there now and he is going through some small items that are collected together in one spot. There are quite a few small kitchen appliances such as coffeemakers. Actually, quite a few of them are various types of coffeemakers, espresso machines, and such. He is going through them because there are just a couple that he decides he still wants. They are sitting on something that resembles a stage platform. I've climbed up on it to try to reach the various things to let him know what is there and to hand him the things that he still wants. I am downstairs with some of the people who have helped me move. Someone suggested that moving back here could be very good for me socially. I remembered that there was a community pool just a block or two away from me. I decided to walk to the pool just to see it again. I had to walk down a steep hill to get to it. I didn't have to walk far before I could see lots of people there. It looked more like a beach than a swimming pool. There were people at the beach. There was a strip of grass or pavement, or both, and then a strip of water that looked like a little gully that had been created by water overflow or a heavy rain. There were no children around. Most of the people there had dark grey air mattresses. A lot of them were lying on their stomachs on their air mattresses, head-first toward the water. A wave of water would come in and they would be washed backwards into the gully of water, or out of the gully of water onto the grass. I thought it curious that everyone had exactly the same kind and color of air mattress. I wondered if they all got them there, if you received one for being a member of the community or if they all just happened to buy exactly the same. There was a small building where someone was working. a pool attendant or some such. She was a young woman, with thick, wavy, black hair that came just above her shoulders. I went to talk to her about using the pool. She needed some paperwork from me that I didn't have with me. She apologized that she couldn't help me without it. I said it wasn't a problem. I would just bring it with me the next time. I walked back up to the condo. Now they look closer to what they actually looked like in waking life. I realized that Fern and Fred still lived next door. I remembered them from when Tom G and Shirley J lived there. I spoke briefly with Fern. She said something to me about having new neighbors on the other side of her also. I found out it was Darren and Angie Ho. I was a little irritated but decided I was not going to let it be a big deal. I listen as she tells Fern that the condo belongs to a friend of theirs that is letting them live there temporarily. She said they may try to buy it at some point but they aren't really worrying about that right now."
"1120"	"(2005-08-15)"	"I was giving a dream workshop at, well actually it was going to be a class. a series of classes at a local high school. It was one of their adult ed programs so they had a whole host of different classes going on in the evenings. When I arrived there were a row of tables with people working behind them to get people registered for their classes. It seems as though I was lying down and covered with a blanket because I didn't have any clothes on except my underwear. I was covered with the throw that I have on my chair at home. I wanted to get up so I did it very carefully and wrapped myself in the throw while I walked over to find my robe. I found it but then I was trying to figure out how to get my robe on without dropping the throw or seeing me while I was switching from the throw to the robe. I was searching for a bathroom but didn't find one. This was all happening because I had forgotten to bring a change of clothes. I don't know what that means. I don't know where I was coming from and why I didn't change before I came here. I'm ready to go to my class and I can't find my room. I keep asking different people for directions. The first person I asked didn't know. The next person I asked told me but then I got lost. I ask again. This woman takes me part of the way. I find it. We get started but there are only about six or seven people there. We're waiting for someone. I decide to have them introduce themselves and say where they are from and why they are there or what they want to learn or why they are interested in dreams. While we were waiting I told them I was going up front. I had some dream magazines that I wanted to give them. I had four different issues and enough of each issue to give to each of them. When I headed back to the lobby to get them I got lost again. I asked a man and he said that even though he works there during the day he gets lost. He's wearing a costume that reminds me of a circus performer. I'm walking through the hallways. They are covered with fabric. Even the ceilings are covered with fabric. It's a very circus-like atmosphere. Some of the walls seem to be quilted. The fabric is different from section to section. I meet someone else in the hallway and ask him. He couldn't tell me either but he did take me to someone that could. There was a man and a young boy. The man said will walk you over there because he's going over there anyway. It was one of the high school students. He had shoulder-length dark hair, was wearing a white T-shirt and carrying a backpack. We walked what seemed to be just a few feet. He sat down. I asked him if he was just going to tell how to get to the lobby. He said, no. We're here. He pointed to the front right of him and I saw the lobby. I thanked him and I went over there. When I headed back to my classroom I got lost yet again. When I finally found it there was a very large crowd of people in the room. It was a big room. There was an area kind of like a stage, two steps up from the rest of the floor. The stage area was a semi-circle. The people were all sitting on the floor but they were in groups. My class was in the middle. I asked them what was going on. They said that it was now so late that the other events have started. I apologized. They said it wasn't my fault. I told them we could go ahead and have the class but we would just finish later than we had planned. They said they were fine with that. The high school had a rule that they had to have at least eight people in the class to go ahead with it and I didn't have eight. Oh. That's what it was. One of the students went to try to recruit more people in the class so we could go ahead with it. So while they were doing that I had gone to get the magazines. When I got back they had just gotten back a few minutes earlier. They found two other people to join the class. I asked the two new people to introduce themselves, tell me where they were from and why they were there."
"1121"	"(2005-08-17)"	"This organization is responsible for having specially trained pilots use unique airplanes to complete a task. The pilots are specially trained for this unique task. The planes look like small, very streamlined jets but they fly more like a helicopter in terms of speed and being able to hover. They are doing testing to see if they can improve the way they do it and the time it takes to complete it each time. The planes have a mechanical device that lowers from the bottom of the plane. At the bottom of the device is a claw of sorts. The pilot lowers the claw, opens it, and picks up two items at once. He then moves them to a different location and places them, not dropping them, in this new location. I was in some kind of relationship with one of the pilots, a man. We had an idea on how to significantly improve the process and the time but the other pilots nor the people in charge would listen to us. We decided that he would try it anyway one time, without telling anyone, when he was practicing with another pilot in another plane at the same time. One of the goals was to reduce the time it took to complete the task. The other goal was to reduce the amount of landing strip needed. The two planes took off at the same time and the man I was with returned in about one tenth the time it took the other pilot. He also landed nearly like a helicopter, needing very little landing strip at all. The other pilot and the people who were observing couldn't believe it. They wanted to know how he did it and he explained that he had done what we had suggested earlier. It is now dark outside. He and I are standing near the plane and we become the cosmic spirits we once were. We look like wisps of white smoke. teardrops with tails turned on their sides. As we begin to float into the night air we embrace and kiss. We have always been a couple as spirits. We have the most complete, full, deep love for each other that I have ever experienced. Now there is some kind of discord between us. I see other spirits. I think I feel threatened that another spirit will get into a relationship with my partner and I will be left alone. Then I realize that we both recognize that we will always be together, always be a spiritual couple. However now it feels more like he sees it as something he must simply tolerate and make the best of."
"1122"	"(2005-08-16)"	"I am at a wedding. All of the girls in the bridal are hairdressers and work at the same salon with the bride. I am with them as a guest at the wedding. After the wedding the bridesmaids go to the salon to change clothes and I go with them. The salon is very unique inside and out. There is a lawn surrounding the salon. In the lawn there are large letters laying in the grass spelling various words. Some were single words and others were placed together to form sentences. They were each very positive, affirming, or inspiring in nature. One of the bridesmaids was the actress Sandra Bullock. A man had come into the salon for a haircut and became interested in Sandra. She was polite and kind but did not give him any romantic encouragement at all, perhaps even gently discouraged such a notion. The rest of us thought it would be good for her so we were trying to convince her to give him a chance. He left. Sandra was sitting at a table making something. She has a shiny white substance that she is shaping into small white ovals with a concave in the top of them. They are a little smaller than an egg and about an inch high. She had finished one and was working on a second. They are sitting side-by-side. They are sitting in something that is sky blue in color. I believe others are doing something similar. Someone begins to move all of them, as if they are on a conveyor belt. Sandra objects immediately. The man who was interested in her returned. He had made something that he thought would persuade her to give him a chance, something that would allow her to see something about the person he is. He had created a remote control toy train of sorts. Each car of the train was a word standing vertical. As the train moved you read the phrase that the various train cars made up. It was something similar to or related to the large flat words in the lawn. We all thought this was a very sweet, touching thing that he did, especially given what the phrase was and we knew it also had some special meaning to her. Sandra was trying not to be touched by it but I had the feeling that she might give him a chance."

"1125"	"(2005-08-29)"	"Bill C asked me to come to the office to help with a special project. When I went in I was trying to find a place to work around Jennifer C. It was a very large room and it was a complete mess. There were papers and boxes sitting all over and file drawers partially open. There were two tables, or desks, sitting together forming a right angle. Jennifer C was working at the one on the right. I was trying to get computer equipment together to work on the left. I was moving things around, as I couldn't even get to the computer. I was getting very frustrated. I could hardly believe they let the office get this bad since I left. Did none of them really care about this kind of thing? The impression it makes on people who come to the office or the lack of efficiency it causes? Jane C had been in there working. There were brown envelopes stuffed full of papers so you couldn't close them and some were sticking out the ends. There were probably 30 or more sitting on the floor. There were also cardboard boxes full of paperwork. She had left a number of filing cabinet drawers standing part way open. She had piles of papers sitting on top of the open drawers as well. My frustration was mounting. Bill C was now in the room sitting at a table behind Jennifer C. I sat down in a chair and turned around to face him. As we were talking Bryan N came in and walked behind me to get something. I immediately turned around as I had something on a piece of paper that I didn't want him to see. I saw him place his hand on it while looking away and turn it over. I was glad he didn't see what was on it. I think he may have come in to get something off of the printer. Bill C and I had been talking about Bryan N. Bill C wasn't happy having Bryan N back. He told me he didn't know how much longer he was going to allow him to stay. He implied that he would like to have me come back after Bryan N is gone and that he realized his mistake(s) with me. After they were both gone I asked Jennifer C what she was working on. She seemed a bit irritated. She was typing Bill C's name on hundreds of checks because whoever had the checks printed neglected to do that. Bill C was making her type the name in on all of them. She had several boxes of them to do. I had a sense that this was not the only thing that she was not happy about lately. She got up and walked to the back to get something. "
"1126"	"(2005-08-31)"	"A man about my age walked up to me. He was a bit taller than me and a medium build, with dark, neatly combed hair. As he came in front of me he slipped his left hand behind me and placed it gently on the small of my back and took my right hand in his. We began to dance. We were meeting for the first time yet it was as though we knew each other. It was totally comfortable. I was thinking that I knew this is how it would feel when I met the right person. We are now on a trip with three other people that are his family. Two are his teenage children, and boy and a girl, and one is his wife. He and his family are so messy. leaving things strewn all over the room. The girl comes out of the bathroom and tells us she had just gotten sick. I was waiting for her to get out of the bathroom so I could use it. I hesitated, wondering if I really wanted to go in right now. just after she had gotten sick. I decided to go ahead. I got in there and she had made such a mess. I was thinking about how bad it was that someone her age would make such a mess and not pick up after herself. that her parents should have taught her better. There was toilet paper all over the floor on the seat of the toilet and some in the toilet that she had not flushed. I debated what to do because I really didn't want to clean up after her but I couldn't use it the way it was. Then I noticed that there was a second toilet on the connecting wall. I walked over to it and it was just as bad. I finally decided that I was going to have to clean up the first one and use it. I walked over to it and, using just my thumb and forefinger, gingerly pulled a bath towel out of the toilet bowl. I was trying to remain as germ free as possible. Then I pulled out another and another. I don't know how many there were but when I finally got them all out there was a big pile on the floor. There must have been six or more. Someone else came in before I actually got to use the toilet. We are in a big room with lots of huge machinery like you might see in a factory. Each machine was expelling something that looked like bubbles from bubble gum. Each machine was expelling different colors and shapes. They were huge, unlike the size of a bubble gum bubble. Some were probably three feet or larger in diameter. Some were oblong and probably six feet or longer. There was no one around operating the machines. We didn't know what the bubbles were for. We were playing around with some of them. poking at them, pushing them through the air, and such. The machines were not expelling anymore so I walked up to one of them. The opening where they had been coming out was about one foot in diameter. It looked like one bubble had just started, not yet breaking through the opening, and stopped. I started poking around to see if I could pry it out. I think some of the people I was with were doing the same thing. Later, the man who operated the machines scolded us for messing with them. He said they had some scientific purpose and we were creating some kind of problem. All the machines are operating again now. I think there are three total. I gather up three or four of the bubbles and realize they act as helium-filled balloons, lifting me off the floor and allowing me to float anywhere I wanted rather than walking. There is a glass door that leads to an indoor swimming pool. All of us have gone out there at various times. We have to go that way to get somewhere else that we want to be. Our room is along the long side of the pool. To get where we want to be we have to walk to the right, across the end of the pool and then out another door. There isn't much space to walk at the end of the pool. It is wet and there are often swimmers sitting or standing there. I walk and back and forth through there twice. I walk very gingerly and watchfully so as not to fall. I especially don't want to fall into the pool. The first time I walk through there are a lot of swimmers there. They seem a bit perturbed to have to move so I can walk by. It seems that someone has been looking for this family that I am with. They are suspected of being aliens. from another country or another planet. I'm not sure what to make of that or how I feel about that. "
"1127"	"(2005-09-01)"	"A man approached me from my parish. I recognized him but didn't know his name. He wasn't much taller than I with a smaller frame, though not really small. He had neatly combed blonde-grey hair. We had never met at church, but I had seen him there. I knew he had children. He was walking along side me and asked me to go out with him. I felt the usual reluctance that I feel when someone asks me for a date, but also noticed that this one somehow felt different. like I should give it a chance. I accepted. He picked me up and took me back to his house. I didn't know what his plans were. His daughter was there. She seems to be about 11 or 12 years old. I quickly realize they are planning to serve lunch. I am looking up at some plates and various things on the kitchen counter and trying to figure out what they have sitting there. I finally realize they have created a very elegant, unusual lunch. We are chatting as they finish preparing lunch. As we are having lunch we are interrupted. He and I have somewhere to go. I take the rest of my lunch with me. It looks somewhat like a half of a pineapple, hewn out and filled with pieces of various fruits and vegetables. We go to his backyard. He has a sunroom. All four walls are practically all windows and screens, allowing an almost completely unobstructed view of every angle. I thought it was odd that it was not connected to the house. Yet, I thought it was very nice, comfortable, cozy. He had written a song for me and was singing it to me. Once again we are interrupted and need to go somewhere else with a group of people. I think it's my family. or at least some of them are family. We walk up to BJ and she is saying something about this man that I am with. I am hesitating and stalling because I don't want him to know that his name has completely slipped my mind. I don't understand why this is and I'm very frustrated and embarrassed by it. I think if I wait long enough she will introduce herself. Finally, she holds out her hand to him and introduces herself. As he shakes her hand he says hello and that his name is Sam. As we continue with whatever it is we're doing we're being very discreet about the fact that we are actually on a date. At some point however, he slowly and gently reaches for my hand and takes it in his. I'm surprised that this is fine with me, it feels more than okay. It feels good. We are having a good time together. I'm still eating my lunch and wondering why it is taking me so long. He comments that it makes him happy that I appreciate his efforts on lunch. He likes that I am enjoying it. There is something that looks like pickle slices. I notice how very good they are. They aren't sour but they aren't really sweet either. We talk and laugh as we continue what we're doing. He is sitting next to me, at my right, but we are sitting perpendicular to each other. He leans over to whisper something to me. As he finishes I gently kiss his forehead. I'm quickly embarrassed that I did that, but it seemed to happen without any thought. I tried to act as though nothing had happened, trying not to make a big deal of it. Maybe wishing he hadn't noticed? I don't think that was going to happen. He sat back and then he leaned forward again and kissed me on the cheek. That was nice. I now felt better about kissing his forehead. A little later we hold a glance at each other for a few seconds. I think he wants to kiss me on the lips. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I have the desire to, but I don't want to kiss on the first date. I want to take this relationship slowly in hopes of not messing it up. I'm thinking that this might actually have a chance, but not totally sure yet. "

But after you've updated it you can update us. He was referring to my asking his permission to re-export my contacts information from the company database."

"1130"	"(2005-09-16)"	"We had hardly any vendors show for the conference. I knew it was because the mailing went out so late. There was a man named James [unknown in waking life] who was responsible for everything once we actually arrived for the conference. He was responsible for everything: the vendors, making sure they were all there, that they all had what they needed, etc. I was standing there talking to him. I noticed the vendor packets laying there. They had never been mailed. Obviously, I was very upset about this and the subsequent poor showing. We were in a small room and I had tables lined up around the walls and maybe one in the center. All of the tables were covered and skirted and the vendors that were there were setting up. The hallway outside the room was very wide and open. The facility had told them they were going to hang white draperies or something like that on the back wall. The facility said they had to take down all of the mini-blinds before they could hang the draperies. There were a lot of them. Two entire walls across from each other were windows."
"1131"	"(2005-09-17)"	"I was out with some of my family. Matthew was with us. He was three years old and someone else's child. He said he had to go to I the bathroom so I agreed to take him. But then I decided he could go by himself, even though he had to go upstairs. The second floor is an open area with a railing where you could see down to the first floor. The bathroom was right on the other side of that railing so I could watch him go up the steps and into the bathroom. I was sitting there waiting for him to come back when I hear these cries and screams for help. I couldn't tell if it was from Matt Or not. I started up stairs when I saw the door open and I thought, oh good. Here he comes. But when the door opened a little girl came out. Then I knew that the screams were from Matthew. Well, they weren't really screams but more really loud crying for help. But I didn't go help. About two seconds later the door opened and I could see inside. There were five or six men. Three of them were standing straight watching. Two of them were bent over close to the floor. Another was partially bent over. I don't know if he was participating or just watching. It was at that point that I realized they were molesting him. I was horrified and frozen. I couldn't move and didn't know what to do. What could I do against six men? Luckily about two seconds later they stopped and left the bathroom. One of them was holding Matthew's hand and they dropped him over the balcony. I caught him. He was just softly sobbing. I was crying. I held him in my lap and just kept saying over and over and over I'm so sorry. Then I finally asked him what they did. I told him that he had to tell me what they did. He sat up a little bit and leaned back and started to pull the front of his pants down. I asked him if they touched his penis and he shook his head yes and started crying again. I just hugged him tighter and tried to console him. I just kept saying over and over, It's okay. I'm so sorry. I was so very angry with myself for letting this happen."

"1133"	"(2005-09-20)"	"I went to the CAS office to retrieve something I had left there. Bill C needed to leave so I told him I would let myself out. He didn't seem to be okay with that. I became very angry and lashed out at him about not trusting me and how I don't deserve that mistrust and never have. He didn't say much, though I could tell he wasn't totally convinced. He did, however, finally decide to leave and allow me to let myself out when I was finished. It looks like I'm someplace other than the CAS office and there are quite a few people around. They seem to be getting ready for a costume party. Brian F is there and I see him walk into the men's room wearing nothing but a Tarzan type g-string. I told him if he was going to wear that I would not have anything to do with him. He assured me he wasn't going to. Later it seems that it was someone else wearing that costume. I'm now standing by a soft drink vending machine. For some reason I decide the money needs to be emptied out and deposited. I take it out and put it in a bank bag. I was going to put a note on it and put it in Jennifer C's desk drawer. Then I realized that she and Bill C both might get upset with me for doing her job. I didn't know what to do then. I realized how long I had been there and that I better leave. If Bill C finds out how long I was there he will distrust me more and be angry with me."
"1134"	"(2005-09-26)"	"I was in a restaurant. I saw Bill C, Bryan N and Jennifer C sitting at a table across the room. I decided it was time to offer the olive branch, bridge the gap and make things more comfortable when I run into any of them in the future. I walked over and said hello. They all smiled and said hello. I asked if I could join them and they said sure. Shortly after I sat down Bill C said something that pushed one of my buttons. I started to respond when Bryan N interrupted. I put my hand up in front of Bryan N's face and said, Bryan N. Wait. Stop. I appreciate your wanting to help but this really doesn't concern you. And I would appreciate it if this stayed between Bill C and I. I knew as soon as I said it that I shouldn't have. My doing that played into Bill C's accusation of my not being able to get along with others. I just stayed for a little bit longer and then went back to my own table. I ordered something to go. But it was something very unusual. something that you wouldn't normally get at a restaurant. But I can't remember what it was. I was standing outside. There was something like a farmer's market just outside the restaurant. That's where I was getting this thing that I had ordered. Bill C came up to me. I said I was surprised to see him, that I thought the three of them had left. He said no and that he wanted to talk. I went back inside with him and we sat down and talked for awhile. He asked me to take a walk with him and I agreed. We went someplace where no one could see us. He began to kiss me and things progressed from there. Then he suggested we go somewhere so we went to his car. He took me to his house. I don't think his family was there but I was afraid they might show up. He had installed a shower stall in his garage for him to use after working in the yard or after sports activities, etc. He got undressed and started to take a shower and then pulled me in with him. We heard Jane C. He grabbed his clothes and headed out the door. I crouched down near the floor in a dark corner. There was a workbench and a pile of towels or blankets or tarps. I was pulling at them trying to get enough to cover myself completely but couldn't. Kara C came in. She was only about three years old. She was holding Jane C's hand and saw me, but Jane C didn't. Kara C kept saying something to Jane C about my eyes. With Kara C being the age that she was Jane C likely didn't pay attention to what she was saying because it didn't make any sense to her. I kept my eyes closed hoping that. I don't know what I was hoping. She touched my eyelids a couple of times. They finally left. Bill C and I went to a little shed. It wasn't much bigger than five by five. I was especially nervous and uncomfortable at this point, yet I didn't really want to stop either."

"1136"	"(2005-09-27)"	"I had gone to the CAS office to help with the transition. When I got ready to leave I gave everyone a hug except Bill C. He followed me out, wanting to give me a hug before I left so I agreed. When he hugged me it felt like a very meaningful hug, tight and almost as though he didn't want to let go. He said something to me. The office building and parking lot were different than in waking life. They were both much, much bigger. There was a drive across the front of the building and then a median with grass and trees and then the parking lot. As I reached the median a woman walked up beside me. We started talking. I don't remember if I knew her or not. We only talked for a few moments because we were parked in opposite sections of the parking lot. I got in my car and drove to CI to the Kinko's on R1 Rd. As I approached the shopping center and wanted to turn in there was a lot of road construction going on. It seems like I did this twice. The workers were directing traffic. One time I couldn't turn in. The next time I turned in I drove over a big pile of dirt or sand. Someone told me not to because I would get stuck. I didn't listen to them and I didn't get stuck."
"1137"	"(2005-09-27)"	"I had gone to the CAS office to help with something. I didn't want to see that Bryan N had moved into what used to be my office. So I tried to walk by the door very deliberately and not letting myself turn my head or even see in from the corner of my eye."
"1138"	"(2005-09-27)"	"I'm having a conversation with someone who is familiar with the CAS company. They were somewhat aware of what had transpired with me there. This person was telling me that Bill C and Bryan N were now having problems getting along. They said it didn't look like Bryan N was going to last long. I don't think I actually responded. I was thinking that I was somewhat surprised because it was Bryan N, but then it didn't surprise me either because of the history of employees with Bill C."

"1140"	"(2005-10-27)"	"Macy F and I had gone to a hotel and were sharing a room. I was going to be seeing a gentleman friend by the name of Scott. Scott had made arrangements with the hotel to have the room right next to ours. We went to our room and it was a very large room with three beds. The headboards of all three beds were along the same wall. There were two double beds and a king-size. Macy F was lying in the middle bed and we were talking about why we had a room like this. We found out that Scott had asked the hotel to remove the wall dividing his room and ours. Macy F and I were talking about how we felt about this. I had a lot of misgivings about it but I don't know how much I verbalized. She didn't seem to have any strong feelings one way or the other. As soon as I saw Scott I asked him why he did it. He made some comment about why but I wasn't sure he was serious and didn't know how I felt about it. Later I find out that Scott had given a copy of our room key to two of his friends who turn out to not be very nice men. They each bring in a ton of stuff. suitcases, clothing on hangers, boxes of all sizes and shapes. Some looked like moving boxes and others were more the size and shape of a long-stemmed rose box. It took over the room, even our bathroom. One of them took over our room and the other moved all of his stuff into Scott's room. They even put stuff in the shower. I'm told they had videotaped me with Scott. I was so upset about this on so many levels and for so many reasons. I was able to get the original and destroy it, but not until after they had already shown it to some people. Scott wasn't happy about it but he wasn't really upset about it either. Now, more than before, Macy F and I decided we wanted these scoundrels out of our room and immediately. We begin grabbing their stuff and just throwing it out into the hallway. In the meantime, Scott has gone to get hotel security to help us. They defended us and kept the two men out while we removed the rest of their things from the room. [I'm too uncomfortable with the details to record them all.]"
"1141"	"(2005-10-28)"	"I lived in the same community as Julie Cr. It's a fairly new community with fairly updated looking buildings. I was walking outside when I saw her. I was quite surprised. We stopped and chatted a little. That's when she told me she was living there also. She gave me her address. It was a third or fourth floor apartment. She told me to come by for a visit. I went to see her one day. There is an upstairs outdoor hallway that is U-shaped. It has steel railings around both the inner and outer parts of the U. There are a lot of home accessories leaning against the railings. artwork, lamps, etc. It seems that it might have been stuff that Julie Cr was getting rid of or she was redecorating and had moved the stuff out there temporarily until she decided what would go back in and what she would get rid of. We were also talking about what she would do with the stuff she was going to get rid of."
"1142"	"(2005-11-01)"	"I was a bridesmaid in a wedding. It was a large wedding. There was a man responsible for doing something at the wedding and he was at the wrong place. He was supposed to be where the bride and bridesmaids were getting dressed. He finally got there. We were pointing and trying to tell him where he needed to be. He didn't seem to understand at all. We were getting very frustrated but finally got through to him. All of the bridesmaids had white dresses, not like a bride though. They were cut straight across the bodice with empire waist line and spaghetti straps. An A-line. They were very soft and flowy. Things were very hectic. The bride had wanted the bridesmaids to wait until the last minute to put their dresses on. When it was time for me to put mine on it wasn't there. I panicked but ran home and got the dress. By the time I got back I only had five minutes before the wedding would start. I realized I had not brought the shoes or any hose. I decided it wasn't a big deal not to have the hose. It was unlikely that anyone would notice. But my mind was going in circles trying to come up with a solution for the shoes. I certainly didn't have time to go back home and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone. All of the others were ready. One of them came and was helping me to get ready. There were a lot of people around so I was trying to do it discreetly and without anyone seeing me in my undergarments. The dress was too small so I really had to suck it in for her to be able to zip it for me, though it looked really nice once it was on. I finally told her about the shoes and asked her if she could go into the church and look around and see if anyone was wearing white shoes that she thought might be close to a size 8. She thought that was a good idea. She came back after just a few minutes with a pair of pale pink shoes. I decided it would just have to do. The dress was likely long enough that it wouldn't even be noticed. When I put them on they had to have been at least a size 9.5 or 10. I thought the dress would cover it up. they would just have to do even though I was concerned about keeping them on my feet and them making a lot of noise as I tried to walk in them. I seemed to be running in to problem after problem. The wedding was late starting. They didn't want to start without me but yet they were very frustrated that they were waiting on me. One thing after another kept happening. After we were fifteen minutes late starting I finally gave up and just told them to go ahead without me. I was very upset with myself. I was frustrated."
"1143"	"(2005-11-01)"	"I was in another wedding. This time all of the bridesmaids were wearing royal blue. We were having a discussion about our shoes being royal blue satin. It wasn't a bad thing. We were just discussing the fact. "

"1145"	"(2005-11-03)"	"Bill C told me he had enough of his bad marriage. He was taking steps to end the marriage so he could be with me. He was already taking steps to do things specifically for me. He talked about where we might live. I was wondering if we might find some happy medium between his current lifestyle and my current lifestyle. I thought that was probably one of the reasons he was unhappy in his marriage, the financial pressures he lives with trying to keep Jane C happy. He told me he was going to buy me a new car, one that had no previous owner. He was talking about a BMW, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to own a foreign car. I was thinking about the mental debate I have had in the past about such a purchase. Buying a foreign car supports people who may not make much or may not have a job at all if not for those car factories. On the other hand, some believe it takes jobs and money from the American economy. More importantly, I wasn't sure about having that kind of a relationship with him. He seemed to want to get married right away and I certainly didn't want to do that. At the most I would be willing to live together for a while until we figure out if marriage is really a good idea. I also wasn't sure how I felt about marrying someone who had been married twice before. "
"1146"	"(2005-11-04)"	"I was out in public, maybe in a restaurant, and saw Jane C somewhere. She sat down on what might be something like a barstool to my left. She asked how I was doing. She seemed genuine in her concern about me, rather than to ease any guilt or second thoughts Bill C may be having. She wanted to know if I was doing okay. She said that every now and then Bill C thinks about calling me, or emailing me, and inviting me to have coffee with him. He always decides against it. She asked me if I ever intend to call him for the same reason, or if I have thought about it. I hesitate. I'm not sure how I want to answer her question because I'm not sure that I want either of them to know that I have thought about it. She asks me again if I will be calling him. I still don't want to answer. There is a part of me that wants to call him, but a bigger part of me that wants to resist that temptation. "
"1147"	"(2005-11-04)"	"I was talking to someone about finding something in my right breast, that it might be a lump but I wasn't sure. They thought I should go see my doctor and have it checked. I wondered what Doctor Pf would say if I went to see him and told him that I had a dream that told me I had a lump in my right breast. As open-minded as he is, I think even he would find that a bit odd. I think he would honor my concern and check it anyway, but I think he would be doing it more to appease me than anything."
"1148"	"(2005-11-05)"	"I was with three acquaintances. At least, I wouldn't exactly describe them as friends. One was a woman and the other two were men. We were at a house but I don't which one of us owned it. Someone suggested we go across the street to see what was behind the neighbor's house. He would never tell anyone or let anyone see. We knew we had to run and hope that he wouldn't see us through any of the windows. There were full-length windows on each side of the house, though some of them were very narrow. maybe 12 inches or less. As we approached the side of his house we had to cross over an area that had 3 or 4 steps, a few feet flat across and then 3 or 4 steps back down the other side. It seemed to be marble. At least it looked like marble, and very ornate. I was afraid I might slip and fall. When we got to the back of the house there was a glass wall. Some of the panes had a frosted design on them. In the middle of the wall two of the panes served as swinging doors, though it was barely noticeable that they were doors. We had to go through those doors to get to the backyard. I was afraid we had been seen as I went through the doors but we hoped we were clear once we did. As soon as we got through the doors we stopped running but kept walking. We were amazed at what we saw. It looked like giant pool and spa area of a five-star hotel. It had all been created with beautiful materials. The level we were on was quite expansive. We didn't have to walk far to see what was on the level below. On the lower level there were several pools of different sizes and shapes. Each had crystal clear blue sparkling water. In some places there were waterfalls into the pools. The way down to the pool was not easily identified. As I surveyed the area I noticed a space that seemed as though it might be a staircase. As I approached it I realized that it was more like a foot holds built down the side of a wall. But this whole section of the wall was nothing but this, column after column of these foot holds all in perfect alignment both vertically and horizontally. It was mostly black but the inner edge of each foothold was painted a bright color. They were various colors with no specific pattern to the use of the color. There was water flowing down the wall so you couldn't go below without getting at least your hands and feet wet. I have a sense that the people who used this space belonged to some kind of club or association. Now I felt even more like I was trespassing because none of us were members. I wondered why it was such a secret though if it was such a club. Why hadn't the neighbor just told us about it. and let us know the requirements of membership? I and at least one of the men climbed down the side of the wall to the lower level and began to explore. We spoke little, except as to whether or not we were going to get in one of the pools. "
"1149"	"(2005-11-05)"	"Someone was driving me to PTEMS to go to school. It was as combination elementary and middle school. As we approached we could look down and see the school buses, heading in our direction, filing in at the back of the school. It seems to be a circular drive with about 3 steps around the outer rim leading up to a walkway, and into the school. The school seemed to be L-shaped and the arced drive framed the inner and back of the building. We saw students along the walkway, on their way to school. They had not ridden the buses. We wondered where people dropping off students were supposed to go. We were now driving between the buses and the steps, but in the opposite direction. There wasn't much room, if enough at all. I was concerned about the students on the walkway. Outside there were two groups of teachers or staff of the school. One group in front of me and one to my right. The group in front of me was 9 or 12 people, standing in rows of three, one behind the other. The group to my right seemed to be a single row of maybe 3 people. Maybe they were greeting all who were coming there that day. As I approached the last person, a man, to my right a woman from the front row and far end of the front group called to me and waved. That group of people seemed to be wearing something like commencement robes. She saw me and recognized me as a new student. She seemed particularly interested in greeting me because of who I was, not because I was just a new student. She was a little older than me, maybe ten years. She had short, brown, wavy hair. It was styled similarly to what I see on my elderly aunts. She approached me and began to speak to me. She asked why I was coming to school there and was particularly interested because of my age. I stammered for a moment, trying to come up with an answer. At first I thought I would say that I wanted to retake some classes that I had taken as a child so I could get much more from them this time. But then I said it was a project. I wanted to get a true sense of what the experience is like in schools of this level in today's society. Other people in these two groups were looking at us and listening as we talked. As I was speaking I decided that I shouldn't have made this up. I finally, told her that I was just months away from completing my PhD and had hoped they might have a job for me. even if only as a teaching assistant as I really needed that type of experience."

When I saw Deven D I told him I was really glad to see him, that I really needed to talk to him. I started babbling about my dissertation and being stuck. He agreed to sit and talk with me. I took his hand and walked a few steps in front of him to wherever we were going to sit. I continued to talk as we walked."

"1152"	"(2005-11-10)"	"At the last minute I decided to attend the class reunion. It almost seems as though we are having it at the school. I think I was already at the school and that's why I decided to go ahead and attend the reunion. I had a male friend with me who was going to pretend to be my boyfriend. He had already signed up to go. It was Randy M. We went to the registration tables. It was really crowded. There were three tables and three women working at each one. There was something else going on in the hallway right across from them. I think it was related to the reunion. I asked them if I could still attend even though I didn't preregister. I didn't actually get registered or get a name tag. We were sitting in a room that looked like a very large meeting room. The chairs were all lined up in rows. Randy M and I were sitting together and talking to someone sitting by us. I knew who it was but it wasn't someone I knew well or had conversations with during high school. Something they said prompted me to look at Randy M. I took his chin in my hand and turned his face towards me and kissed him. I said, that's why I love you. Later, Randy M is now Matthew. I had taken him along because no one knows him and he could pretend to be my boyfriend and no one would ever know. Of course, I wasn't thinking about Darren. I was getting so upset with Matthew. He was slouching in his chair. He wasn't talking to anyone. He would walk away without a word and be gone for long periods of time. I was getting more and more upset. I finally told him to just go to the car and sleep or listen to music or whatever. I was just so frustrated and embarrassed by his behavior. The next activity at the reunion they were talking about the additions and major changes they were making to the school. Albert S was doing most of the talking. Now we were in an area that had two levels. The upper level was an L shape. more like a hallway than a room with walls on all sides. The lower level was a fairly small square room. The upper level had very large cutouts in the wall looking down into the room of the lower level. The lower level had several rows of chairs set up facing a side wall and then several rows of chairs facing the front wall. Albert S was standing on the upper level looking through this cutout and talking to the people who were sitting below. There were also people sitting in chairs on the upper level. I was sitting on the end of a row next to two other women. I knew who they were but never had a conversation with either of them. We were making wisecracks to each other as Albert S spoke. They had their name tags on so that helped me to know who they were. I was noticing how many people I didn't know because of how much they had changed. A lot of these people may not know who I am. Of course, even if I had my name tag on they may not know who I am since I go by Anna now. I suppose if they had given me a name tag it would be better for me to have them put the name Elizabeth on it. The two women I was sitting with said something about not knowing who I was or not having a name tag. I said, my first name is Anna. Even if I had my name tag on I doubt you would know who I am because I've changed both my first and last name since the last reunion. They gave me a funny look, as most people do when I say that. We got ready to go on the tour. I was going to be very careful not to get separated from the other two women so I wouldn't get lost and not be able to find my way back. When I went to school there it was next to impossible to get lost because there were just four hallways and they formed a square. They've made so many changes even before the recent remodel. As we started the tour it felt very confusing to me and that it would be very easy for me to get lost. As they started the tour they were talking about a couple of teachers they were trying to hire. One of the things that they were using to try to lure them there was that they had built teacher residences into the building. Kind of like apartments but when you went inside they looked like any home. I think there were three of them. They were taking us on a tour of each of them. We went through a doorway that led us into a common entrance area for the three apartments. It wasn't square or rectangular, but instead had several odd angles. It looked very nice, very modern. It was nicely decorated. Some of the rooms in the apartments were kind of small, especially the bathrooms. When we returned to the main area for the reunion activities, I think it was the cafeteria because everyone was sitting at rectangular tables. I saw the six women that was my close group of friends in high school. They were sitting together at a table. I went over and said hello and began to talk with them. I told them I was surprised to see them there since they had not been at the previous reunions I attended. I said, I don't think I've seen you since and at the same time I finished the sentence they all said the same thing, the reunion at the American Legion. I think they went to the first two and then none since. Marlene F and I continued to go until the last two. I didn't go to the last two. As I was standing there talking I realized I shouldn't have been concerned about going alone because there were plenty of people there who were single or divorced. And it shouldn't be a big deal for me to say I'm in the midst of a professional transition. I don't have to say I was fired and can't find a job and try to explain why I haven't found a job yet. I noticed various people had brought one of their adult children along as a guest. I was thinking that I didn't need to have Matthew pretend to be someone else. There wasn't an extra chair for me to sit down. Angie Hz was talking to someone else so I couldn't say hello to her. Brenda E was sitting further down at the table. I didn't interrupt whoever was talking so I just waved to her and mouthed the word hello. I felt awkward about being there with them. I'm not sure if I felt out of place or unwelcome. I remember how often I felt that way with the group when we were in high school."
"1153"	"(2005-12-06)"	"I was in my office at CAS. It was set up differently than it was in waking life. The desk was facing the right wall, up against the wall. There was no computer credenza. I was sitting there working at my laptop. Bill C came up and stood in the doorway. He didn't say anything right away, like he was deciding what to say or if he should say anything, wondering if I was still mad at him. He was wearing black denim pants and a lime green shirt. It had ruffles, almost like a tuxedo shirt. His socks were also lime green. He finally said something. I answered in a testy or unpleasant tone of voice. He came in to the office and sat down in a chair to the right of my desk. We talked for a little bit. I closed my laptop. I opened the middle left desk drawer. There was a black shoulder strap, like for a computer case, in there. I picked it up partially and then could tell it wasn't mine. I closed the drawer and left. As I approached the front doors of the office suite I noticed that both Karen E and Jennifer C were standing there talking. I didn't want to face them but couldn't avoid them. So I just kept walking and didn't make eye contact. "
"1154"	"(2005-12-09)"	"Bill C had requested that I come into the office to take some team photographs. They needed some to represent who the team was when I was still there. It was important to him that I be in it. I was very uncomfortable with the request but I agreed to go anyway. I arrived at the office. I didn't see Bryan N. Bill C said just a few words to me. Jennifer C didn't say anything. I went into my old office. I had brought some things to read and work on in case I had to wait, which I did. Bill C came in and talked a little bit more. He said they had some art supplies they were going to get rid of and if I wanted any of them I could take them with me. Jennifer C came in. She didn't say much at all but took me to the back to show me what they were getting rid of. She pulled out something that looked like regular pens to me. I told her I wasn't interested in them. Then she pulled out something that looked like regular highlighters. Again, I said I wasn't interested. At this point, I'm wondering why Bill C called these art supplies and why they were getting rid of them. They could at least use the regular pens. Then she pulled out something that looked like a special kind of pen and one that I really liked and knew I would use. Just as I finished saying I would take those, Bryan N walked up and asks what was going on. Jennifer C told him. He said he liked those. I just said, Fine. Let him have them. I turned and walked away."
"1155"	"(2005-12-10)"	"It seems like I was at home with Mother, yet I was in BR. I had some clothing racks that I needed to return to NTNS. I was trying to figure out how to return them because they wouldn't fit in the car, etc. Then I remembered that I had taken them apart so they would fit in the car. The store is so close I don't need to drive them down there. So I decided to take them by foot. It started raining pretty hard. When I was on my way home my mind was wandering and I wasn't paying attention to where I was going. When I snapped out of this trance-like mode I was in I realized that I had gotten lost. I didn't know where I was or how to get home. I knew I was pretty far from home though. I was laying on the ground. Mark M was laying to my right. I was laying on my right side as we talked. I saw an older, bedraggled man walk up behind me. I saw he was getting ready to sit down. But he actually laid down right next to me with his back to mine. I was frozen from fright. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. I was trying to mouth the words help me to Mark. I was afraid. I didn't know who this man was, why he was doing this, what he was going to do next. When Mark finally did see me mouth the words he stood up and very nonchalantly said, I don't think so. It was in response to my requesting help from him. It wasn't in a mean tone of voice or anything like that. He just said it and then walked away. I'm laying there terrified now because I'm alone with this man. This man starts talking to men and I realize that I know him. He is someone that I had gone out with in the past. He was hoping that I would go out with him again. He wanted a second chance at a relationship with me. He had changed and he thought it could be good this time. A friend of his walks up and says, There you are. His friend's name is David West [unknown in waking life] . They started talking about a new office building they just finished constructing. The name of the building was Smore Sjore. They asked me to recommend a hotel for them. I invited them to spend the night at my house. David was a bit hesitant but his friend was all for it. They finally decided to spend the night at my house. They started walking to their car and I ran after them. I suggested that I could ride with them since they were going to my house. That way they would find the way back and I wouldn't have to walk all the way. I had wandered so far from home. Now I'm walking in the BR area. I walked past BCHS. I think I was walking to church. But when I got there I decided not to go in and I just kept walking and again ended up much farther from home than I had intended. It seems like I got lost again. But then I am walking down the main street of BR and I see a huge new office building on that street. It's blue and grey, steel and glass. It's maybe 5 or 6 stories but takes up most of the length of the block. In the middle front of the building was a set of glass double doors. There was a large sign over the door that said Smore Sjore. I thought, Ahhh. That's their new building. I went inside and there was a small lobby area and another set of glass doors that led into a larger lobby. The larger lobby was packed with people. I don't know that another person could have gotten in there if they tried. I stood in the smaller lobby. A woman came up to me, I think she was with a media source, and began talking with me. I think they were having some kind of grand opening event. There was another woman standing there who worked for the company or was somehow associated with David. I asked her if she knew the names of the two men who built this building, wanting to discreetly verify that it was David and his friend. She said, Oh no. I don't think anybody does. I said, No. I'm acting as though I'm trying to remember their names and kept prodding her. The other woman with us said, She knows. She didn't know that for a fact. It was more the kind of statement that she believed the other woman knew the names. I finally said, One of them is David. Isn't it David I think West, isn't it? We were standing at a corner. There was a hallway to my left. Just as I said his name, I noticed David in that hallway and had just reached the corner where I was standing as I said his name. He heard me. I saw the look on his face. I excused myself from these two women and stepped over to speak with him. He was clearly uncomfortable with me mentioning his name but he was so nice about it. He didn't want anyone to know that I knew him. I don't think he wanted anyone to know who he was at all. He was also concerned that if someone told his wife that they saw him talking to me or heard me mention his name that she would jump to the wrong conclusions and get upset. But at the same time he was trying to be very discreet about his identity and with our conversation, he was also trying to be very kind to me. I thought it was very sweet the way he was handling the whole thing. I said something to him about his friend and he said something like I'm afraid that boat has sailed. I'm not sure but whatever he said gave me the impression that he thought he and his friend had both missed out by being married and not being available to be in relationship with me."
"1156"	"(2005-12-12)"	"We were having trouble finding enough dresses in the colors that she wanted for the bridesmaids. We couldn't find enough fabric either. We finally decided that we would have them made anyway but use two different colors in each dress. The front and back panels would be one color and then we would insert a panel on each side of a different color. I was trying to figure out the best way to do it. When I told BJ about it she had already made one of the dresses. She had decided to go with all one color. Oh, maybe we were going to take the dresses that we found in the store and we were going to put insets in to adjust for the sizes we needed. But she decided to make them and keep them all one color. They were all white and very simple. Short sleeve, A-line dress. Very plain. On the day of the wedding we realized we were short one dress so one of the women was not going to be able to be in the wedding party after all. There were two black women in the wedding party and one of them was not going to be able to be in it now. Things were very hectic that day. Those same two women had ordered wigs with long, red hair. BJ didn't want them to wear the wigs. We were on a farm or the property where we were had chickens. There was a large wooden storage bin in front of the fence where the chickens were. Myself and someone else were leaning on the bin and talking when the wigs were delivered, although they only delivered one. We took and threw it behind the fence and storage bin. The chickens quickly destroyed it, though you couldn't really see it anyway. We pretended that we didn't know they had even been delivered. A little later something else arrived that someone besides BJ had ordered. I knew she didn't want it in the wedding either so I did the same thing with it. threw it behind the fence to the chickens. There was something hanging on or attached to the wire fence. It was almost like a piece of white fabric. I pushed this thing further under that fabric so I could be sure it wouldn't be seen. Someone did find it later but it had been all chewed up. I said I didn't know anything about it. BJ was not dressed yet. The bridesmaids were all dressed but we were finishing our hair and makeup. I hadn't even started my makeup because I had been so busy helping her with things that she needed. Finally it was almost time to leave to go to the church. I knew there wouldn't be any spare time once we got there so I had to hurry and get my makeup done. BJ and I were both in the bathroom washing our faces. I commented on the terrible condition of my complexion. My face was very broken out on my forehead. I was embarrassed by it and not sure I would be able to hide it for the wedding. I used an acne treatment. I couldn't find my makeup. I finally decided I would use her makeup. I found a shade of eyeshadow that I thought was close to my own but when I put it on it looked awful. KIM came up and asked how she could help. She asked me what colors my own eyeshadows were and I said I didn't know. I finally realized that my dressing table was sitting across the room and all of my makeup was in there. So I sat down and put on my makeup. Someone had made these things that I would best describe as looking like the guard shelter you would see behind a London guard. It had three walls and a pointed roof on top. The inside back were painted blue. Someone had taken white paint and did a decorative thing on the blue. There was one for each bridesmaid, as though we were going to be behind us as we walked. I'm not sure and don't know how that could possibly work. Someone had taken one of them and had painted various colors of balloons in it. They had written words on it intended to be words of encouragement for children. Words like courage and patience. I went and told BJ and she said it was fine. She said we should do them all that way. I didn't think that would look good at all but that's what she wanted. There was a young man there who was going to be driving her to the church. He was helping with whatever we needed. He was trying to keep us on schedule and reminding us what we needed to be doing, etc.  "

We decided we would not let anything else keep us apart again. He was attentive, gentle, kind, loving, caring, interested in what was going on with me. in my life and in my head and my emotions.

"1159"	"(2005-12-20)"	"Danny [unknown] needed information about sleep disorders and didn't have much time to prepare for whatever it was he was preparing for. I told him I had a small manual from the last sleep conference I attended that might be useful to him. It would be a fairly quick read. He was happy to have me lend it to him. Shortly after I lent him the manual he did something that aggravated me, but more in a prankster kind of way. Someone told me he was taking shower and reading the manual as he showered. I went to the shower and quickly pulled back the shower curtain, taking him quite by surprise. He stood there silent and stunned. I grinned, grabbed the manual, and left. A few minutes later he was out of the shower and standing in front of me, still unclothed. We were only about a foot apart. There was a counter or table behind him. I started talking to him and as he did he leaned backwards until his back was almost resting on the table. My face was still only inches from his. I'm grinning the entire time I'm talking to him. I finally walk away. "
"1160"	"(2005-12-20)"	"I was attending a daytime event at my high school. School was in session. I decided to go early so I would have time to walk around and see the school and talk with anyone I might know. When I arrived I was given a schedule for the day. It looked like a layout of the building, with text in little boxes representing classrooms. The first place I was to be was in Ms Thompsons' English class. I was amazed that she was still there more than 30 years later. When I got to her room I realized her class was already in session and I was hesitant to Interrupt. I opened the door very slowly and quietly. I didn't see any empty seats so I closed the door again. There was a small alcove right inside the door, about four feet by four feet. I decided I would go in and just stand in the back corner and observe. As I did so Ms Thompson got up out of one of the student's desk and invited me over to sit there. I excused myself as I walked carefully across the front of the row of desks, being careful not to step on anyone's toes. When I got to the desk and prepared to sit down I hesitated because I didn't want to appear clumsy or fall as I went to sit down. The chair itself was a color that blended in to the wall and floor. I could easily see the desktop but that was all. After I sat down I realized there was at least one other empty desk as well. The desks weren't set up in neat rows as you would expect. There was a nearly full row of desk along the back wall and closest to the door. There was a big gap at the end of that row nearest the window and then my desk. Then another gap. There were a few other desks sitting randomly in front of that row. As I sat there I noticed my brother Bill F outside the window. I was surprised to see him. He was outside playing with some small children. He stopped and came into the classroom through a door in the outer wall. He didn't seem to even notice that he was interrupting a class. He looked at me, waved, and asked me if I wanted lunch. I said no, not sure what to make of all of this or even why he was asking me about lunch. After the class ended I went into the hallway. It was crowded with students. I was trying to figure out where to go next. I was talking to someone. They suggested I go where Bill F is. He was there trying out some new equipment at the school. fitness equipment I think. I didn't know if I really wanted to do that or not. I then found out that many of my familiar members were meeting there today and having lunch together. I went into the cafeteria. There were a lot of elementary school children there. They were working on projects at the tables. Bill F was in there helping some of them, then he left. I went up behind two little girls and talked with them briefly. I think my sister BJ was in the cafeteria as well. I went back out into the hallway. It was still crowded with students. My niece, Jody S, walked up. I don't seem all that surprised to see her there, even though that is not where she went to high school and she didn't even leave near there. BJ and Bob F didn't go to school there either, but the other four siblings did."
"1161"	"(2005-12-22)"	"Dorothy S, her husband, and I buy a house together. We're beginning to move things. I was going through my kitchen things trying to determine what to keep and move with me and what to get rid of. I suggested to Dorothy S that since she cooks so, so much more than I do that I thought it would be best if she took care of moving things into the new kitchen. I wanted it to be comfortable for her since I do little in the kitchen. She agreed with that. I was going to get some linens and make the beds but then I realized that we had only moved one bed in, in a guest room, because we all still had at least one more night sleeping in ours at our old homes. My older and middle brother were both there helping, along with some other people. Bill F and I are someplace that looks kind of like a storage facility, but it is part of where I've been living. In one part of this building there are inside walls that do not go all the way to the ceiling but are connected with a horizontal surface. I had stored some of my things up there. Most of the things up there were filthy, dirty. Bill F was sitting on this surface at the corner where the two inner walls join. I was standing on a high rung of a wall ladder that went up the side of the shorter of the two inner walls. I was standing so my waist cleared the top of the ladder. A third person, I think it was Matthew, was walking around up there, bringing the things over to Bill F and I. I would decide whether to keep it or save it and then Bill F would act accordingly. Matthew brought me something that looked like a painting or a similar type of wall-hanging. The back was covered with a think layer of grey dust. Then he brought me another and this one was even worse. It was covered with not only the thick layer of grey dust but also large dust balls. Bill F knocked a couple of the dust balls off. Matthew and Bill F thought I would tell them to throw them both away because they were both so dirty. I told them I definitely wanted to save them as I really liked them and they had a lot of value to me."
"1162"	"(2005-12-22)"	"I was in my home and I saw a man pass by my front window. I immediately thought he looked very much like Vince P. I ran to my front door and opened it to get a better look. It was Vince P. There was a place to park just to the left front of my home. That's where he was parked. As he was preparing to get into this car I called out to him two or three times, using his last name to be sure I got his attention. There were a few large shrubs at the front of my house so the view was largely blocked. The third time I said his name he finally turned in my direction. Because of the shrubs he didn't see me right away. I was peering at him mostly between the shrubs as his head was just barely above them. He finally noticed me. He was with Joanne N. They locked the car again and walked over to me. I invited them in. I did not receive the warm reception I expected from them and was quite saddened by this. I didn't have much furniture in my living room as the carpets were wet, and soaking wet around where the coffee table normally sits. We talked a little about what happened to my carpets. I am somewhere else with another woman. We are talking to a third woman, Lisa S. As we talk I realize that she doesn't recognize me. I'm wearing a name tag, but because of my name change she still has no idea who I am. I finally say something about her not knowing who I am. She smiles and seems a bit embarrassed that she now realizes she should know me. Myself and the other woman start giving her hints, worked for her in the city where I live, etc. I finally say, The store manager who brought this very store from a ranking of 128 to the top 25. Before I said the last few words she realized who I was. She seemed very happy to see me. We hugged and chatted a bit. I was telling someone else now about how I've been running into all of these people from my past recently and how much I've enjoyed it. I suddenly became very concerned that this was happening because I was going to die soon. "

"1164"	"(2005-12-23)"	"I was running a cafe along with a group of peer students. I knew all of them, though the only two I can identify right now is Karyn L and Mary Kay C. All of us rotated in covering the various responsibilities rather than each person having one assigned job. The cafe had three individual glass doors at the front. Each one locked separately. We had decided as a group that whoever was closing at night, usually a single person, would lock all three doors, after the last patron had left, while they completed the closing tasks. One person would come back late to leave with whoever was closing. That person would use their key to enter the cafe through one of the glass doors. One night I was going to be closing. When the person who was coming back left for the night she left all three doors unlocked, even though all the patrons were gone. I was in the back so I didn't realize this until later when she came back. I was very upset to know that I had been in their that late at night, alone, with the doors unlocked. She said she didn't lock them because she didn't think it was necessary and she didn't want to bother with her key when she came back. A group of us had a somewhat heat discussion about this. Everyone but this one person agreed that we should stick to our original agreement to lock all three doors and use our keys when we come back. We felt it was in the best interest of whoever was closing each night. When some people had certain jobs they seemed to be much less productive. This was either because they were uncomfortable with the job because they didn't feel they knew enough to do it well or simply because they felt they weren't good at it. Sometimes it was that they simply didn't like that job and didn't want to do it. On one wall of the cafe there was a very large wooden box on the wall. It was square, dark wood, and about six or more inches deep. It had wood slats that divided the whole box into equally sized small square storage spaces. Each of those squares was about three by three inches. We used this to store things that we wanted readily accessible for our patrons. that we could either grab things quickly or they could grab them. Each space had an assigned purpose. Some of the student staff had not been doing a good job of putting things back where they belong. I found this very irritating. A group of us were discussing this, though I was likely the one most irritated with it. Some of the spaces had what I can best describe as piles of dirt or sand in them. something with a similar make-up and look. Some people had been taking the items and just laying them in the appropriate space but in this dirt or whatever inappropriate substance it was in those spaces. Where items had been placed in an inappropriate space I was removing them and putting them in the space they belonged in. I was doing this while talking with the others about use of this box. I was having an individual discussion with Karyn L, though I think Mary Kay C was within hearing distance. It didn't really get heated but we both had strong convictions about our point of view. I finally decided not to continue because Karyn L is much more strong-willed than I am and I just didn't feel like continuing the debate. I especially didn't feel that I had the energy to win. "
"1165"	"(2005-12-25)"	"I was two other people, searching for something. We were in a seemingly empty room. The way I can think to describe the inside size and appearance of this room is an empty airplane hanger. Even the ceilings were enormously high. It was well lit. We noticed something near the ceiling in the far, left corner of the room. The main part of the object was circular, kind of like a large horizontal ring around the outer rim, a horizontal circle that was suspended inside and a little bit higher than the ring. It had a special light in or shining on it, which is how we spotted it. We seemed pretty sure that if we positioned ourselves right under it we could easily propel ourselves from the floor up into the object under our own power. We had barely stepped underneath the object when we began to propel upwards, almost like slow-moving rockets. When we got beyond the first ring we saw the other ring. This one was vertical and maybe 12 or so inches deep. Both rings were easily 6 or more feet in diameter. We landed and stood on the vertical ring, looking down at both the circle and the outer ring. The difference between the lighting around this object and the lighting in the rest of the room was still clearly noticeable. I don't know where we were or why we were there.   "
"1166"	"(2005-12-25)"	"I was working at my computer. The screen I was viewing was an odd combination of MSWord, Explorer, and the screen to view the files in the search screen. I wasn't able to read the entire file locations. I noticed that the toolbars at the top of the screen were misaligned in a way that I hadn't seen before. Some of them started at the far right of the screen and then continued below. There were large gaps between the end of one and the beginning of another on one row. I thought if I fixed that it would resolve the other problem. I kept clicking on the bar at the beginning of the toolbars and trying to move them into place the way you normally would to change their placement but for some reason it wasn't working. And at least one or more of the toolbars had icons on them that you wouldn't really find on a toolbar. "
"1167"	"(2005-12-26)"	"When my employment with Bill C ended he invited me to spend Thanksgiving with the rest of the CAS staff and their families. On Thanksgiving morning Jennifer C came to my home to pick me up. I don't why I didn't drive myself. She was having the dinner at her house and members of her family would be attending as well, parents, in-laws, and her sister Karen E. She took me to her house. Initially I wasn't thinking about who would be there. When we arrived at her house she pulled her car into the yard near the back. It was raining. As soon as she parked here I realized that there would be quite a few people there. I began to feel uncomfortable. As we were walking towards the house I asked her if it was uncomfortable for her. She said that it was. I told her I wasn't sure about it either. The CAS staff and families had never spent Thanksgiving, or any holiday, together before. I didn't understand him wanting that this time and especially inviting me when I am no longer employed there. I thought it might be that he did it to make himself feel better about letting me go. She said that she didn't know why he did it. She did say that they had discussed it the last day they worked before Thanksgiving and Bill C was regretting having invited me because he was now feeling very uncomfortable about it also. We entered the house and Karen E was standing there. I hugged her as Jennifer C and I finished talking. Karen E was wearing a dress with a pale or white background and small flowers. It looked like a dress that would more often be worn in the spring. Karen E had heard the end of my conversation with Jennifer C and said something about it. I agreed that Jennifer C and I both thought it was uncomfortable. Karen E was sitting on a sofa between two of Jennifer C 's other family members. I walked up to her and crouched down in front of her and put my hand on her knee. I asked her if she would mind taking me home. Then everyone got into a discussion about the whole situation. I finally said that I thought I would be uncomfortable for everyone if I were to stay, that it would be much nicer for all of us if I went home now. I thought this was especially true now that I knew that Bill C was regretting having invited me and was also feeling uncomfortable about it. The discussion continued. I was becoming anxious because I wanted to leave before anyone else arrived. Jennifer C finally took me home. As we went back to get into the car, there was a little shelter. It reminds me of a glass-walled entryway to a parking garage. The ceiling was drop tiles. They were water stained and a hole in one of them. Jennifer C didn't realize there was a leak until she saw me touch the top of my head because I had felt water drip on me. We both looked up at the ceiling. We had to walk through this little enclosure to get into the car. As she was driving me home we were talking about Christmas decorations. She said she hadn't put many of hers up this year. I told her I hadn't either, both because of the how cold the weather had been but also because I just didn't seem to have the energy for it this year."
"1168"	"(2005-12-27)"	"Bill C had called and asked me to come to the office to help Jennifer C with some boxes she was preparing for shipment. I was quite irritated by this, yet I went anyway. When I arrived they had a dozen or so rectangular medium-size boxes sitting in the lobby. They were all full but just needed to be sealed, labeled, and delivered somewhere for shipping. This is why Bill C had called me. I was even more irritated now, not knowing why he asked me to come and do this. Jennifer C brought me one of the labels. She was making the labels, one at a time. She didn't bring me the shipping tape or anything else. They had another woman working in the office helping Jennifer C. I just kept getting more and more irritated by the whole situation. I have no idea why I agreed to do this or why I stayed. Bill C asked me to go into his office to talk with him. It looked different than in waking life as it was larger and had room for people to sit across the desk from him and at one end of the desk. I sat down in the chair at the end of the desk, knowing the psychology of having the desk between us. Our conversation was casual, and a bit awkward. I got the distinct impression that things were not going well for Bill C and that he regretted letting me go. It was as if he realized bringing Bryan N back and letting me go just made things worse instead of better. He seemed to be leading up to asking me about some type of part-time work arrangement. I got the impression that he was thinking about project based and possibly me working from home. I wasn't sure how I felt about this or if I would agree to such a thing. I thought to myself that I would just have to tell him no, that it would not be a good idea. There was more to this out in the lobby, with other people, and with the boxes, but I'm having trouble sorting it out. I was wondering how I would get all of these boxes out to my car, and in to a shipping facility. There was something about moving the boxes around in the lobby. I think I just decided not to help and I was just going to leave but Bill C convinced me otherwise."
"1169"	"(2005-12-27)"	"It seems like there was some kind of event going on. I am sitting bareback on a horse, standing in what might serve as an aisle. On either side of me there are a lot of people, I think sitting in chairs. I was trying to leave but couldn't get my horse to go. I looked down and saw that the horse was standing in several inches of water and was drinking the water. I pulled the reins to get his head up but he just jerked away and went back to drinking. I wondered if the horse was ill because he was drinking so much water. I finally got the horse to move and go a few feet and then Bill C came up and stopped us. He wanted me to take him where he was going. I moved forward a bit so he could get on behind me. I noticed how it felt to have him sitting there, against me. It felt comfortable and safe. We only went a few feet and stopped because Bill C didn't feel that it was working. He got off and told me to move up a little further. He got back on and we tried again. That still didn't work so this time he got off and then got on in front of me, telling me to lean in against him and wrap my arms around him to hold on. "
"1170"	"(2005-12-27)"	"I was out on my patio by the gate. It was partially open. I looked up and saw a black woman standing there. She was dressed in what I can best describe as a brown, hooded, full-length cape. She looked daunting and scary. I slammed the gate shut, latched it, and told her to leave. She said she was Nicki T from the SF store. I told her I didn't believe her and turned and went inside. I knelt down on the floor and crawled to the staircase to go upstairs. I didn't want her to see me in there or where I went. I came back downstairs a few minutes later but stopped halfway down. I leaned over the banister and looked out the kitchen window to see if she had left. She hadn't. She had reached over and unlatched the gate and entered the patio. She was standing right by the kitchen window looking in. I jerked back hoping she didn't see me. I wondered if I had locked the patio door when I came in. I worried that I hadn't. What if she tried to come in? I was trying to figure out a way that I could get to the patio door without being seen and make sure it was locked. As I tried to do this she came in. She removed her cape. I could now see that it really was Nicki T. She had an adolescent girl with her and a baby. I invited her in to sit. Her and the girl sat down on the sofa. I apologized for my behavior. She wanted me to see her baby. She handed the baby to me. I took it in my arms and told her how beautiful it was. Matthew was there. I made the comment that I love other people's babies. I meant that I did not like what went along with motherhood during the first two years of a baby's life and I don't have to do all of that with other people's babies. I can just enjoy them. We chatted for a little while. She told me she was going to be getting married. I asked her where she was working now and she said she wasn't, that she was collecting unemployment. She seemed to be embarrassed by that. I told her that I, too, was currently unemployed and collecting unemployment. Something she said made me think there might be a chance that I can get my unemployment benefits extended beyond 26 weeks. The young girl wasn't her daughter but a female relative. When she got ready to leave I was glad that she had been persistent and that I did get to see her and her baby and talk with her. "
"1171"	"(2005-12-31)"	"I was living on Lakeland with Darren. I had gone into the garage for something and I saw what appeared to be a dead animal. As I got closer I realized that it was a huge, black rat. It was the size of an adult cat. Close by it I saw a very tiny mouse sitting in place and quickly realized that it was dead. I thought it was very odd that it died sitting upright and it's body stayed in that position. Moments later I hurried back into the house and didn't want to go back to the garage until someone got rid of them. I went out to the front porch through the front door and saw more of the huge, black, dead rats. They were hanging from the house, lying in the flower bed and other places. I think I saw more mice as well. I hurried back into the house and went into the kitchen where I saw more. They seemed to be everywhere. There are few things that bother me as much as rodents. I was feeling extremely anxious and panicked and not even wanting to put my feet on the floor for fear of stepping on one. Yet, no place in the house felt safe. Someone came to get rid of them, either instead of Darren or to help Darren. "
"1172"	"(2005-12-31)"	"Knowledge Created Out of Need. I was with two other people that I knew, a man and a woman. The woman was demonstrating something about her trousers to the man and with her left hand she was pulling at the left pocket of her trousers, pulling it away from her body. At the same time she was moving her right hand in and out of her right pocket and wanted us to notice how the fabric of the trousers didn't seem to move at all, even though she was doing it simultaneously with pulling at the left pocket. One seemed to have no effect on the other. I turned to the man and said, you know what they say, knowledge is created out of need. "
"1173"	"(2006-01-01)"	"Bev was in the third grade. I was at my birth home with other members of the family. Bev was asking for permission to date. I asked Mother if I could try to help. I started talking to Bev about why she wanted to date and about her age. I told her that I was 18 before I had my first date. As soon as I said it I realized that was wrong, that I was actually 17. I didn't correct myself, though. I was talking to her as though I understood her wanting to date already. However, I really didn't. She was only ten years old."
"1174"	"(2006-01-02)"	"I was talking to someone and working with the various versions of my resume trying to figure out which one was the right one for whatever purpose we had been discussing."
"1175"	"(2006-01-02)"	"I opened the door to the downstairs bathroom intending to go in and get something. Without turning the light on I started to place one foot in the room and realized that it was flooded. There was about 3 inches or so of standing water. Apparently the toilet had overflowed. The rugs were under water, not lying flat or topside up and out of place. The wastebasket had fallen over and was out of place. There seemed to be other things on the floor that were simply out of place. The standing water would not be possible in waking life as the water would have simply flowed out of the opening under the door. I had found a small puddle of water outside the bathroom door a few days ago. I wiped up that water, thinking that I would check in the bathroom later because I was in the middle of something else at the time."
"1176"	"(2006-01-04)"	"I was wearing a floor-length, gold-colored, gown covered in sequins. I was sitting on a ledge outside the third or fourth floor of a building. I was sitting there to watch all of the celebrities arrive. I seemed to be way out of proportion to the building and other people, etc. It's like I was a giant in the land of regular people. The celebrities weren't arriving the same way you would normally see them arrive, a long row of limos and them entering the building via a red carpet. Rather, the street looked like normal and there were not huge numbers of people. The celebrities just stood around outside a mingled a bit with each other before going in. I was watching for one of my favorite male actors in particular. He was a younger man, maybe in his thirties, with naturally curly, blondish-brown hair. When I saw him arrive I was going to go down so I could go in and take my seat when he did, hoping to sit next to him. He was outside mingling and I got distracted by another favorite male actor. He was near my age or older. Dark hair and very distinguished looking. I started looking around again for the first man. I was looking everywhere, when I realized he wasn't out there any longer. I asked someone where he went and they said he had gone inside. I was upset that I had gotten distracted and missed him going in so I hurried inside. The seating looked more like what you see at a sports stadium. As I walked to find a seat I kept looking home to spot him. Just as I got ready to sit I spotted him so I walked past some people, excusing myself as they seemed a bit irritated with me. I hoped to find a seat at least nearby him. As luck would have it, there was an empty seat to his left. I sat down and we exchanged a courteous hello. There was another woman sitting to his right. They had come in together. He had been in relationship with the other woman, but they had an unpleasant ending to that relationship. I could tell the energy between them wasn't good. As the program started I began whispering little comments to him to establish rapport. He would smile and nod but not say much in response. My comments turned into flirtations. There was a time or two when he put his hand on my leg or patted my hand. Suddenly, he turned to me, picked me up and sat me on his lap. I asked him what he was doing. He took off his tie and jacket and something else. And he implied that he was going to make out with me. I told him he needed to stop, saying that we never know when the cameras might be on us. He made some very explicit sexual move and just as he did there was a spotlight on us. I was very embarrassed. Later we decided that we were not an appropriate match. He agreed to give me up if the other actor I had been watching would commit to being with me. I felt this was a little odd, yet oddly did not object. He gave me something like a piece of paper and something else and told me to go ask him. If he agreed then we would proceed accordingly. I took the things over and showed them to him as I spoke with him. I was a bit surprised when he agreed, though it didn't seem that unusual. As the evening ended we were mingling with others in attendance, often having our arms around each other's back. We were walking around and seem to be doing various things, laughing and having a good time. I asked him if he needed to go to any of the after parties. He said he was invited to all of them, and that actually a few of them very specifically requested that he show up for a last a few minutes. He wanted to take me along and just visit each one for a little while. I knew we would be up all night doing this. He went and changed out of his tux into a suit, to be a little more relaxed and comfortable. I thought how nice he looked but also realized that I didn't have anything else to change in to. He seemed to be fine with this. There was something about when we went out to get into the limo. Some kind of confusion and conversations related to it with several other people. I was watching where I was stepping. maybe because of the weather - snow, mud, or such. He and I are walking somewhere with our arms behind each other's back. I turned to him and said I hated to admit it but I might be falling in love with him. He smiled and nodded in agreement, saying that he thought this might just work out long term."
"1177"	"(2006-01-05)"	"Bev was a young child, maybe four or five years old. We took her to the hospital because she had been ill. We learned that she needed to have surgery. I think I was more concerned and frightened by the prospects than she was. The doctor had made an incision on her right cheek close to her nose. He then inserted a tube that was attached to a machine. Something bad was happening in the hospital. Two men dressed in regular attire decided to chase the culprit. I realized that they were super heroes, like Batman and Robin, that weren't in costume at that time. I had some investment in what was happening so I wanted to follow and help. I ignored them telling me not to. The culprit entered a square hole in the wall that was attached to a wide, curvy, and very long slide. maybe more than one story long. At the entrance to the hole there was a bright, orange, beam of light that was about six inches in diameter with an ell pointing downward on each end where it met the wall. It was a security beam. The culprit managed to slide under it without setting off the alarm. The younger super hero headed off in another direction to try to cut him off. The other one slid under the beam and followed the culprit down the slide. I followed him, worried that I might not clear the beam but I did. As I was the man was telling me not to follow but I just ignored him. I wondered when he would change into his costume. Wherever we landed was filled with people. There was a long hallway running to my left and right. Down quite a way to my left I saw Bill C. He looked a little different than normal, more tousled or frazzled. I had not seen him since we parted company and that had been causing me some anxiety. I decided the time had come to get it over with and behind me so I walked down to him to say hello. There was clearly something going on with him that had him a bit distraught. He seemed happy to see me and said hello. He wanted to talk with me but asked if I could wait a few minutes. I see Brian F and Latonya M headed back to Bev. I knew my way around the hospital since I used to work there. They had chosen the worst possible route. I suggested they follow me. They seemed to have something with them, like luggage on wheels or maybe two-wheeled luggage carriers with things on them. I didn't know why they had them or needed them. I intended to take them through some employee-only areas. There wouldn't be these crowds of people, it would be more direct, and shorter. One area that we went through was either an ICU or an emergency care area but it was a long, rectangular room with beds lined along each long wall, like you would see in an army barrack. I took them on an employee-only elevator, going up to a higher floor. When we got back Bev was still where we left her. She was in a very large open, brightly-lit room. She appears smaller or younger than before."
"1178"	"(2006-01-06)"	"We were moving. There were a bunch of things that we had to figure out what to do with temporarily, about dividing it up. It seems like it was food from the freezer or refrigerator. A number of people came up with suggestions that kept getting voted down. I finally made a suggestion that the man keep all of the non-flowering houseplants and I would keep all of the flowering ones, since they were my favorites, and then we could just keep them permanently. He liked this idea and agreed to proceed accordingly."
"1179"	"(2006-01-11)"	"I went for my informational interview with Jeff S. After we finished talking he said he was going out for a cup of coffee and asked if I would like to join him. Because I felt this could be an important future business contact I agreed. As we walked down the street, he said he had this special little place that he likes to go. By the looks of the outside of this place I had not even realized it when we arrived there. The entry was dark but there were three white steps leading up to the door. To the left the wall jutted out as far as the bottom step as did the overhead. Now we are in a mini-van type vehicle. Jeff S is driving and I'm sitting in the front passenger sit. There are two people in the back seat. In the seat directly behind me is Jennifer K. I don't know now who the other is. I am turned sideways in my seat, with my legs and feet resting between my seat and Jeff S's. I am talking to the two people in back, but primarily to Jennifer K. Somebody says something that unnerves me. Without thinking I lifted my right hand as if to grab something for support or stability. Jeff S takes my hand. He does so just partially, and cautiously. But I had the sense that this concerned me more than him. I didn't want to give him the wrong impression or do anything inappropriate. It was at this point that I realized he was a single dad. Sometime during all of this we talked about his children, who seemed to be all boys. Something caused me to let go of his hand. I reached to take it again but this time he was holding his hand sideways with his fingers spread apart and my fingers seemed to just naturally go between his. It wasn't until after I did it that I realized what I had done and again felt a bit concerned about impression or inappropriate action. But he just tightened his fingers around mine, just a little, confirming that this was okay. During all of this he never took his eyes off the road, but I don't think I ever looked directly at his face either. I had now let go of his hand as we continued to wherever we were going. I was wearing a skirt that came just above my knees when I sat. As I was talking to the people in back I felt Jeff S's hand slide gently between my knees and lightly caress the inner part of my right knee and just slightly above. Of course I noticed immediately and wasn't sure what to think. He did two or three other similar things, always very subtle, yet noticeable. I reminded myself that he is single and thought that perhaps there was some romantic interest. I thought how nice it would be to be in a relationship with a man like Jeff S. Now Jeff S and I are in this place having coffee and Jennifer K is with us. I don't know what happened to the other person. The weather outside was such that we had coats on, but not necessarily winter coats. It was raining and beginning to get dark. I got the impression that because Jennifer K was with us Jeff S didn't feel he could leave when he wanted. I didn't know if I should say anything to him, to let him know it was fine for him to leave. I had a tote bag with me, with my handbag, portfolio, etc in it. I was looking around for their restrooms. I got the attention of a woman who worked there and she said take me there. She had very pretty, black, shoulder-length hair with lots of volume and wavy curls. I am outside the restroom with Jennifer K. I went in cautiously because there wasn't a full door. The door was more like a stall door in a public restroom, except that it didn't go nearly as high. So passersby could see who was in there. Jennifer K knew I was very uncomfortable with this but had decided I just couldn't wait any longer so she stood in front of the door, facing me, and talking. I noticed a man standing behind her waiting for me to finish. I became concerned, wondering if I was using the men's room or if it was a coed restroom. I did notice a urinal on the wall. As I left I heard a family talking at a nearby table. They were talking about a tote bag that the little boy found and that it was so comfortable. I realized that he had picked mine up and taken it to his table. He had set a stuffed animal on top of it. I just casually went over and picked up my tote and walked away without saying anything. I heard someone at their table tell him that he didn't get to keep it and I somehow knew that the little boy was disappointed. As I returned to the table it occurred to me that possibly Jeff S was hoping Jennifer K would leave so he could talk with me alone again. I suppose he finally gave up and said he needed to get home to his children. He got up from the table and hesitated for a moment then left. A little while later he returned. I don't know if he said told me this or I implied it, but that his children were all tucked in bed for the night so he could leave again. Now I'm in the van with just Jeff S. As we are driving he is expressing his romantic interest in me. He said he wanted very much to kiss me. I was flattered, intrigued, yet wasn't sure how to respond so I simply smiled and said nothing. Later he says the same thing again. Now we are back at the place we were and Jennifer K is there, again or still. There are a bunch of things that we need to load in the back of the van. The van is now Jennifer K 's and it is pretty full of her family's things but we find room for what we need to put in there. The back of the van, from the outside, looks more like an SUV. But from the side it looks like a van. There are several food-serving dishes sitting in the back, with no lids yet partially consumed food in them. I found this curious but said nothing. Jennifer K and Jeff S are both leaving now but Jennifer K is leaving the van for me to drive home. She gave me the keys and said something about the van - like it being temperamental or some such. I tossed the keys in my tote and went back inside alone. I thought I had misplaced the keys once or twice. The place was getting ready to close for the night. I was standing near a back corner that was not well lit. There was a man standing 20 feet or so behind me. Jeff S walks back in and comes straight towards me. He stops just a few feet in front of me. He doesn't say anything, but suddenly leans forward and kisses me. After I got past the surprise of him showing up, and then doing this, I was thinking that he was a really bad kisser. He kept his lips tight together and pursed like a pucker. This was very disappointing. I was trying to make it better but not being successful. He stopped for a moment, said something, and then kissed me again. This time with open mouth. It was a little better, but still not great. He turns and leaves. I am now with him again, and I think there are other people around. We're having a good time, talking and laughing. I notice that his voice is different than I recall. It's not the deep and strong voice I was used to hearing from him. I thought maybe he had a cold. Then I noticed that his teeth, particularly the upper ones, were in very bad condition. The ones that were still there were very irregular, and some very dark. Really bad teeth are always a real turn-off to me. I felt guilty about this because I know it is very superficial. Yet, I have trouble wanting to kiss someone with really bad teeth. I either guessed or he told me that he is the midst of having some significant dental work done and his teeth look like they do because they are in the middle of the process. This made me feel better about thinking about being in a romantic relationship with him, yet I still felt bad because of my attitude towards this. Now I am alone again in the restaurant. All of the other patrons have left and there are two employees still there, closing up. Apparently there had been some kind of spill when Jeff S was there earlier and we had used a towel he had with him to clean it up. Jeff S called my cell phone to tell me it had been left at the restaurant, but it was very important that he get it back. He was guessing that it had been thrown in the trash. He said it had some important information on it. When I got off the phone I asked one of the employees about it. She took me to the back to where the trashcan was. It was a small office-sized wastebasket. Right on top there was a white towel that appeared to have spaghetti sauce all over it, or something like it. I gingerly picked it up so as not to get anything on me. Moving it around with my hand I looked at it to see if it was the right one. I told the employee that it wasn't. Then I noticed another one in the wastebasket. Again, a white towel with something that looked like spaghetti sauce all over it. As I bent down to pick it up I noticed the row after row of typed information on it. I said that this is the one. I picked it up and turned to leave. I went outside to the van. I seemed to behind the building, with the back of another building across the parking lot. There were only one or two other cars in the parking lot, and the van was parked furthest away. I was a bit nervous about walking alone to the van at this time of night. When I got to the van I realized that it had been broken into and someone had stolen some of the things that we had put in it earlier. That bothered me of course, but I was most bothered because Jennifer K had lent me her van and now some of her family things had been taken as well. I thought it was odd that they had taken some of the food-serving dishes. The two employees came out of the door Jeff S and I had entered originally. One came down the steps while the other locked the door. Then she same down the steps. She saw me by the van and said something to me. I told her about the things being stolen. As we talked another woman walked up. She was a maintenance worker of some kind. She said she threw the things away because she thought they were supposed to be. I was very upset yet trying not to show it, as I didn't want to hurt or upset her if it was an honest mistake. I quickly started looking around, thinking I could just retrieve the things from the trash. I asked where she had disposed of them. She pointed towards the building and said she had thrown them over there, in the river. Now I was simply flabbergasted. I was thinking, what? Why would she do that? Why would she dispose of things she thought was trash in a river? However, while I was thinking this I was looking towards where she was pointing and not seeing a river by any means. I thought that was crazy. There wouldn't be a river running alongside a building, and there wasn't enough room between these two buildings for there to be a river anyway. As I squinted and tried to focus my eyes to see better in the darkness, I noticed a small gully cut into the cement along the building. Water was flowing out of an opening through this gully. The gully went 20 - 30 feet or so and then there was a sharp right angle and it continued. I think a little further down there was a sharp left angle where it continued. As soon as I noticed it I ran over there hoping that I might be able to retrieve the things. I saw nothing and realized it had been too long since she disposed of it and it had all been washed away.

"1180"	"(2006-01-12)"	"I was working with someone. We were facing a wall that had a storage unit divided by partitions creating about 1-foot squares. In each square was a cylindrical shaped object, but not smooth cylinder, just that general shape. I think they were green, or shades of green and yellow. I have no idea what they were or how better to describe them. We were trying to put them in the right order based on their condition. Those in the best condition would go first, etc. We're now working in my flowerbeds preparing to transplant quite a few of my perennials. We were trying to figure out the new placement of each one based on how tall they get when in full bloom."

When one of the couples names were announced as either being the winner or staying in the contest for another week, the man leaned over and gave his partner a long, serious kiss on the lips. This really surprised me because I thought he was a married man and I knew his partner was not his wife. Maybe others were surprised by this also, because somehow I learned that he was, in fact, single and this kiss represented feelings that had been growing for him towards her."
"1182"	"(2006-01-14)"	"Tom Cu and Mary Cu were moving to the city where I live. They asked me to go along with them to look at condos. They went to North Point Bay. I was telling them that I wished I still had my condo there, that I miss it. We actually looked at two different ones there. One of them I was lagging behind them when they left. I walked out just as the woman who owned it pulled into her driveway in a sports car. Some of her female friends were meeting her there. She gave me a look as if to say who are you and why did you just come out of my house. I got nervous for a moment because I didn't even see Tom Cu and Mary Cu anywhere around. But her friends just got in her car and they left. This one was extremely modern and either two or three floors. It was a very open floor plan with lots of red and chrome. I can't recall if the floors or the walls were red. The staircases were open with chrome banisters. It didn't seem to have much at all inside in terms of furnishings. We went to look at another one. It was very different. This one seemed to be more traditional looking on the inside and more of a first floor than second. It seemed almost cluttered with furnishings. The outside front yard of this one was great. They had built an arbor. It was beautifully landscaped. There were grassy areas and other things that I can't recall now that really attracted me to this one. We stayed inside this one for quite some time. We walked back and forth. While we were walking around we were talking about how excited I was that they were going to be living here and they were saying how excited they were that they would be able to see me so much more. I don't if we actually talked about this or if I just got this impression but it seems that I was going to be with them at least once a week, but likely more. We'd either be visiting each other or doing things together or I would just hang out at their condo. At separate times they had each given me a hug. It seems that another member of my family is there too but I can't recall for sure, or who it was. We went back outside and were just strolling around the front yard. They asked me which one I thought they should buy. I told them that of course I couldn't make that decision for them, but if it were me it would be no contest. They looked at me as though they didn't know which one I would select. So I said, something like, are you kidding? With this great front yard I would definitely pick this one. While pointing I mentioned a few of the specific features that I liked so well. One of them was the arbor over the entrance. Then I said, but then that's just me and my taste. "
"1183"	"(2006-01-14)"	"My whole family is together. We decide to go to Kentucky. We all seem to be rushing around getting ready to go. We're turning out the lights and such. I go to get one of the children and by the time I return realized that everyone else has left. They went without us. The child was a toddler but I don't know whose she was. It's storming and raining outside. I'm hurrying around the house trying to make sure all of the windows are closed and locked and that the back door is locked. I see Mike A outside. His face seems to have cuts or scratches on it - uncovered. He knows I am in here. I'm very concerned about this. I'm concerned that he is going to try to get in and come after me. I see him walking around the outside of the house and looking in the windows. I know he can see me in here. We make eye contact more than once, though I try to act like I don't know he's out there."
"1184"	"(2006-01-14)"	"I went downstairs in the morning and saw that UPS had put two separate notes on the high windows of my front door, notifying me that they had packages for me. I wished they wouldn't so often put them up there because I rarely notice them up there. I wondered how long they had been there."
"1185"	"(2006-01-15)"	"I was at an office and saw that all of the old SXDS district managers were there. I was noticing how much some of them had aged. Of course, I was looking desperately for Gary S , though unsure that I wanted to see him. Some of the others saw me and came up, smiled, and said hello. They seemed very pleased to see me and I certainly enjoyed seeing them again. I saw a young woman there and realized that it was Kelly S, Gary S's daughter. I was somewhat hoping he had gained weight. That way I could talk to him without feeling self-conscious about the weight I've gained. I caught a glimpse of him and immediately thought that he hadn't changed at all. He didn't seem to have aged much. I mean, he really had. I suppose it was what some people would call aging well."
"1186"	"(2006-01-17)"	"I was at my birth home with many members of my family. My dad was in the house doing something. My mom and the rest of us were outside. She wanted to clean out the garage and complete the job before my dad came out to interfere. The first thing we were doing was moving everything outside and doing some sorting as we did so. We sorted for trash, for things to be sold - at a yard sale or such, things that needed to be stored in a different place or a different way, things that would be given away. Unlike in waking life, the garage had somewhat of a loft storage area. Bob F was up there handing things down to someone below. There were six or so artificial Christmas trees that were assembled and sitting up there. Mother was standing down below watching as he handed them down to someone else. As he did so they discussed what they might do with these. They were trees that they've used sometime in the past, but don't use anymore. One or two other family members said they would like to have one of them. They each seemed to look a bit different so they were saying something about those differences. The garage was covered wall-to-call and all over the ceiling with stuff, just as my dad's garage is in waking life. In quite a few places there were individual tools and such hanging on the walls and even on some of the support posts. He had attached wood strips to the support posts so he could use them for storage. Everything looked so dirty. There were some things that we were happy to find, that we had forgotten were out there. I didn't want to see them leave. I wanted someone in the family to keep them. It seems that one thing was a box of dolls that belonged to one of us girls growing up. I think I wanted someone to keep them because I still regretting having sold mine some years ago when I was unemployed and needed the money. I was looking at some of the tools and such hanging on the walls. They were so dirty. Covered with dust and cobwebs. Because they were hanging on walls I wondered if we really needed to take all of that stuff out of there. That seemed like a nightmarish task to me and I intended to avoid it if possible. Someone was sitting by one of the support posts and I asked them what they thought. They just shrugged their shoulders and said they didn't know. "
"1187"	"(2006-01-18)"	"I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001. Only where the alcoves were in that dream were doors to the various rooms in this dream. It was almost like a large open lobby, with the doors of the rooms on three walls and the opening from the staircase on the other. I told Jo V I had dreamed about this space before and now here it is. I'm loving that. We walk around and look at the various rooms. The first room we look at only has a curtain for the door. It is the smallest and the most modestly decorated. I thought Jo V would probably take this one and let the students have the other rooms. The other rooms had doors. I was thinking about the small storage crawl space in Grandma's house that we used to hide in as children. I wondered if they had left that and was trying to remember what room it was in. I also remember that a number of the rooms had one or more smaller rooms, or storage areas, inside the individual room. I was trying to remember which room, or rooms, that was. I realized that I had designated that for my own room. It seems to change, sometimes in the dream it seems to be upstairs and at other times downstairs. When they refurbished the house they made the staircase much wider and made all of the steps from a beautiful knotty pine. Towards the bottom of the staircase it made a sharp left-angle turn for the final few steps. Those steps were each longer than the one before it, creating a kind of fan shape. We're talking about needing to finish up the painting. I called an expert and asked their opinion and they told me I should paint the baseboards and crown molding to match the wall colors but leave the door and window trims white. I had gotten a very small thing of paint, about the size of a matchbox except a tad longer. It was the pinkish-red color that was in one room. I had a small artists brush and I began painting one of the baseboards, toward the top so I could immediately see how well it was going to match the wall color. A little later someone came and asked me about it. I said I had put a little on there to see if when it dried it would be close enough to the wall color. I told them what the expert had said. They didn't seem to think that I was going to work, or not going to look good. I'm not sure which. The area now seems to be one long, very narrow hallway with all of the room doorways to my right. I see that the students have gone ahead and chosen their rooms rather than waiting for me. I see one girl lift a curtain and come out of her room. I look toward the ceiling at the curtain and realize that there is just one long curtain hung across the entire wall to act as a door for every room. That meant they had to lift the curtain from the bottom when going in or out of their rooms and risk disturbing those in the other rooms. I didn't think this was at all satisfactory. The house is attached to the children's museum. The alcoves in the October 01 dream were in the back section of a theater, behind the last row of seats. I see a wall with a somewhat hidden entrance. I decide to take Jo V and show her what is back there, acting like I know what it is when I actually don't. There is a woman in there practicing some type of event or performance with a combination of adults and children. I don't know who they are. The woman turns and looks at me and says, sshhh. I realize who she is, who they are, and what they are doing. [Don't know any of them in waking life.] There is another doorway, leading to yet another area behind this one. Again, I pretend to Jo V that I know what it is and take her back there. I realize this is the back stage area for the children's museum. We shared use of this backstage area. I was unclear as to whether I owned the entire building or just the house portion of it. But this means the scene has changed from being a country home in St. Joe to a city home in the city where I live. I lead Jo V back, quietly walking through the area where the group is practicing. I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there. The left and front walls are lined from floor to ceiling with various fabrics. The right one or two shelving units are full of decorative trims. Along the right wall something else is displayed, related to crafts or sewing. In the center of the room is a large workstation. There is a woman there. She introduces herself as the staff seamstress. I immediately thought to myself that I cannot afford to have a full-time seamstress and wondered then if I had other full-time staff. She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night. I decide we need to have an initial house meeting to discuss rules and such, and then we need to have them on a regular basis. I tell them all we are going to have a house meeting in the morning right after breakfast. Some of them moan and roll their eyes. Others look at me like they don't know what I'm talking about and don't understand why we would need this. I tell them it's to let them know the house rules but also to discuss anything they want to discuss. For example, if one of them have allergies to fragrances we should all know that and try to respect it by refraining from using any kinds of fragrances around them. Or if anyone has something that is a real hot-button for them, we should know about it. We just want to get to know each other and try as best we can to respect each other and each other's preferences. It will help us to live together much more harmoniously. I decide that I'll also talk about signing up for tasks during the house meeting. The next morning I go down expecting to see the kitchen staff fixing breakfast. Instead, I see all of the students fixing their own breakfast. One is fixing peanut butter on toast. She has a special name for it, but I can't recall now what it was. I felt bad that they were having to fix their own breakfast, yet certainly didn't want to do it myself. There was very little room to move between the counters and stove and it was not well lit. There were probably fifty students there. I call attention for the house meeting. I realize that I need to get everyone closer together so I can see everyone and so that everyone can hear. I decide we'll go somewhere else in the house and wave my hand asking them to all follow me. The walls are now very curvy. When I get to where I want to have the meeting there is just a large carpeted area. I think it should be fine to ask them to sit on the floor. There is one obese girl there. I see a friend trying to help her sit on the floor. Before I can change my mind she is sitting so I decide to let it go. Many of the students have stopped further down the hall, around one of the curves and I can't see them. I start and decide I need them all closer together so I call those students to come to where we are. I realize there isn't room for everyone there so I walk further and instruct them to continue following me. We reach an area that looks somewhat like the lobby of a nice hotel or a very nice waiting room in a hospital. There are partial-walls every now and then, all curved. Some have sofas and chairs toward the middle of the room, semi-hidden on both sides by these partial-walls. Some have sofas and chairs along the outside of the walls. There are plants and it is very nicely decorated. I stop there and ask the students to find seats. Some will have to sit on the floor but I'm not concerned about that. I think some of them are still too far away but decide to just make the best of it. I had gone to ask the woman in charge of the children's museum if we could just use the auditorium for our meeting. Even though there was nothing going on she didn't want to allow it. I wondered again if I owned the entire building or just the house part of it. I begin talking. I have to talk loudly so they can all hear me. There is a floor to ceiling sheer-fabric curtain hanging along the wall I'm facing. I realize that the backstage area of the children's museum auditorium is on the other side. At first I don't think much of it because there is nothing going on there. As I talk I walk around the area. I look behind the sheers and see there is some kind of meeting or performance going on in the backstage area. I then tell the students they are going to need to move in closer together so I don't have to talk so loud and bother the people on the other side of the curtain. As I am talking I am also standing on some of the tables so the students have a better chance of seeing and hearing me. I occasionally step from one table to another, without stepping on the floor. The wall behind is made of glass panes and the train track is on the other side. I see a train pulling up. I jump off of the table and begin running along the wall with the train and looking through the glass to see who is in the train. I am hoping John is on it. I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in. I don't know if she realized what I was doing. I leaned a bit to my left so I could see her and I told her that this is my private living quarters. She said something about the house map not being very clear about that. This happens one or two more times with 2-3 people coming in together. Now a girl comes in wanting to talk to me. I tell her that is fine. We'll just sit at my desk there to talk. After I've finished with her I went to find the seamstress again to talk to her about the door to my private living quarters. At first the door was a full wood door with a bubbled glass pane in most of the top half of it. On the outside of the door we had something printed on it to designate that it was private quarters. I realized that whatever was on it was not clear enough. Now it seems that the door is just a partial one, more like what you would see on a public bathroom stall with another alongside it. One leads to my private quarters and the other leads to the sewing area. We decide that students are getting confused and coming in the wrong door. But then it seems that there is just one door and the confusion happens when they come through the door and face two hallways. They choose the one to the left that leads to my private quarters instead of the one to the right that leads to the sewing area. Then I suggest that maybe we just need two separate doors. The seamstress is going to once again contact maintenance and have them take care of it. She will also have them change the wording on the door to make sure it is very clear that it is private quarters and they are not to enter. I suppose if I keep it locked at all times it would solve the problem. I'm not sure why this doesn't occur to me then, or why I don't want to do that. My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives. [unknown in waking life.] I run out to the living room and see that the front door is standing open. I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me. Most of the time I would have to stop what I was doing, turn my head, and ask him to repeat himself because I either didn't hear or didn't understand what he was saying. He said something to me about his room. I was surprised that he had chosen a room upstairs with all of the college students rather than having the room designated for him downstairs. I'm trying to put my makeup on. I put my mascara on and realize how long it has made my lashes. I look at the tube and see that it is one that I've not used before. I'm very excited that it is working so well. Then I realize they have gotten very clumpy. As I try to fix it I smear it on my cheek. I reapply it and then use my eyelash comb to separate the lashes. After I'm done I decide they look ridiculously long so I decide to try to remove and fix it. As I do the lashes on one eye ends up looking like a sparkling blue and the lashes of the other eye are a sparkling pink. I wonder if I can just go like this - if it's very noticeable. Matthew tries to tell me it's not but I can tell he's lying so I redo it completely. As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me. He says something, indicating that he doesn't want to and I say, please, in a begging tone. I know it's not going to be easy to describe to him where it is because it is a drawer in one of the small rooms inside my room and I haven't fully settled in at our new home yet. I do my best. The attic has been refurbished to house the student's rooms and that is where my private living quarters are also. He comes back and hasn't found it. Then I realize it is in the safe and tell him where the safe is. I realize I'm going to be an hour late for work. I decide that I'll call Bill C on the way and tell him that I'm running late because of the birth. I'm concerned that my car is blocked in and I'm not going to be able to get out. I found out that Bev was leaving at the same time and that was going to be enough for me to be able to get out. Daddy and someone were emptying things out of the back of my SUV. There were looking at it and talking about it being my new SUV. At that time it looked like a truck, but when I got in to leave it looked like an SUV again. As I got ready to pull out of the driveway I noticed there were cars parked to my left, all along the right side of the road, bumper-to-bumper. It was still just dusk, mostly dark. A car seemed to pull out of our yard from the left side of the road and heading towards me. I noticed it was an older couple. The man was driving and a woman was sitting in the passenger seat drinking a cup of coffee. I looked around to see why all these cars were around. At first I thought maybe one of the neighbors was having a yard sale but decided it was too dark outside, or too early in the morning for that. I went ahead and pulled out of the driveway headed to my left. Just after I did I realized that I had forgotten something and needed to go back to the house. I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on. Earlier I had been talking with one of my brothers and mentioned a local bar and deli that had closed. They asked me which one. I told them it was a small one on of the corners. It was a little mom and pop business. As I was walking to my SUV, I remembered this conversation and was trying to remember on which of these corners the business used to be. If I could remember then I could tell my brother more precisely where the business had been. As I walked I wasn't even sure I would know my SUV when I saw it, because I hadn't had it very long, it looked so much like so many others, and it was dark outside and little hard to see. As I walk I see about one hundred feet in front me is a large vehicle completely blocking the road. I immediately get upset thinking that this will be yet another delay in my getting to work because I'm not going to be able to get around him at all. I realize that he is moving out of the way. I walk back and forth two or three blocks trying to find my SUV. I see a man with a boat pulled perpendicular to all of the cars parked along the road. It looks like it is against an SUV. At first I think it's mine and I get upset and start looking at the SUV to see if there is any damage. There isn't but then I realize that isn't mine anyway."
"1188"	"(2006-01-19)"	"Someone had asked me to babysit their child for a little while. He was a toddler so I decided I would probably be okay with that. It was Matthew as a child. After the parents left I went upstairs to his room. He was standing in his crib, though later he looked to be five or six years old, certainly too old to be in a crib. Now we're in my home. I ask him if he wants to help me move some things. I want to move a bunch of dumbbells from the top closet shelf in one room to another. I start with the small ones that I think he will be able to carry with no problem."
"1189"	"(2006-01-19)"	"I and someone else are working with some EMT's, but not as EMT's. We are on some kind of covert mission. They have me lie on my left side in the back of an ambulance between the side of the ambulance and the gurney, with my feet toward the front of the ambulance and my head at the back doors. The ambulance is parked inside a dark garage. I hear someone coming. I try to hide but there isn't enough room for me to fit all the way down between the wall and gurney. I'm sure if this man looks back there he'll see me and then I'll have to come up with some explanation. He opens the door and immediately sees me. Then he nods and has this look on his face like he knows who I am and why I am there. He gets in and we leave."
"1190"	"(2006-01-19)"	"There was an ice cream truck that every now and then would drive around the city offering free ice cream bars. He would open the double doors on the back of his truck and there was a tower of white plastic drawers. In each drawer was a different kind of ice cream bar. They weren't individually wrapped. Just lying side-by-side in these drawers. One of them was what we used to call Drumsticks. One drawer had Toffee Bars. One had something that had a red coating with white speckles and another just like it in blue. The driver would let you take your pick. Or if you wanted to try more than one you could. I and the person I was with took three or four. As we began to eat one of them we stuck the others in our pockets."
"1191"	"(2006-01-20)"	"I had to go to the office building where CAS is located, but for a reason unrelated to CAS. As I entered I tried not to look in the direction of their office. I didn't want to see anybody and I didn't want to see any changes they may have made. Bill C saw me and asked me to come in and talk with him. I tried to say no but he persisted. As we entered the office suite I couldn't help but notice the major changes they had made in the floor plan. Bill C had walls moved to completely reconfigure the space. There was now a straight hallway with offices on either side. I don't know where the training room was and the reception area seemed to be just another office. Jennifer C had gotten her hair cut, very short and in a radical style that would be so unlike her in waking life. She was talking on a headset and got up from her desk and walked away. She looked at me but didn't smile or anything. Bill C took me into his office. He said something about Mary. I didn't know who Mary [unknown in waking life also] was but quickly realized it was a new employee and that it was someone Bill C knew before he eliminated my position. I suspected that I also found out that he didn't wait very long after I left before bringing her in. Bryan N had talked Bill C into all of these changes. This didn't surprise me. If anything, it just confirmed some of my beliefs about him. Bill C had something of mine that I wanted to get back. He said it was at his house and told me I should ride along with him as he went to retrieve it. I was very reluctant but it seemed that it was going to be the only way I was going to get it back. We got to his house and I waited in a chair outside. This particular area seemed to have an overhead that connected two buildings - maybe house and garage? I'm not sure. It was somewhat dark though, the way such an area would be when protected from the sun. Jane C came home and saw me there. She immediately came towards me to say hello and ask how I was doing. I said fine. I didn't want to say much, not knowing what was safe to say and afraid I would say something I shouldn't about the whole situation, or about Bill C. She said some things in a low voice. I got the impression that she was trying to let me know that she understood about Bill C, and that she agreed with me about what he did to me. He came back out and I really just wanted to leave and go home. Kara C and some of her friends were there and wanted to go swimming. He needed to do something for them with the pool and wanted to do it before we left. The pool was very elaborate. It was both inside and out, with an outer wall of the house in the midst of it, yet allowing the water to flow between both. The outside part still had an overhead shelter, just no walls except the one connecting it to the indoors. It was an odd shape and had some elaborate features like a waterfall. I was trying to wait patiently. I was in the house. Jane C was doing laundry. There were other people visiting them as well. I was standing in a room where Jane C had piled all of the clean laundry she had folded. She had piled it so high it was very unstable. A couple of times it started to fall and I caught it. One time I picked up some of the smaller items on top and divided them into two stacks on top rather than just one, hoping it would at least be a little more stable. Bryan N shows up. Now I'm very upset and uncomfortable because I really don't want to see him. I don't want to have anything at all to do with him. He's carrying his usual superior attitude, talking and laughing. I went to find Bill C to get him to take me back. We argue about it so I decide I'll just walk. I tried numerous ways to get out of the house but for one reason or another each one failed. I tried doors and windows. Bill C and I were both at a window once. I thought I could just climb out the window and then walk away. But right outside the window looked like a black hole. I would have to stretch my legs across it to put my feet on the ground. I'm not sure my legs were long enough to do this. I knew Bill C wouldn't have any trouble with his height of 6 ft 4 in. Once I was at a window, hurrying to get the window up and the screen out so I could leave before anyone saw me but someone did. More than once I started to walk but Bill C stopped me. He started making advances toward me and trying to figure out a way that we could be alone. They had a dog that kept following us when we tried to leave. Once when we did get outside a neighbor's dog came running up to us and for some reason he knew he couldn't leave with me because of that. After several failed attempts he reluctantly gave up. Bryan N said or did something he didn't like. I don't know if I said something to Bill C or if I just thought to myself, now you're seeing the true Bryan N. I was talking to Jane C again, telling her that I really wanted to go and that I was ready to walk back if he would let me. She told me how close their house is to the office where my car was parked. She pointed out the window and told me I just needed to walk up to the top of that hill and I would see the office and parking lot. On my way to the car I walked through some new homes that weren't finished being built yet. In one room, I think in more than one of the homes, there was a large odd-shaped counter. I thought it was part of the kitchen. There were large rolls of fabrics nearby. Jane C had suggested I use one of these counters with a material that I already had, I don't know that it was fabric, to make something I needed or wanted to help me get home. When I got to the top of the hill I could see at the bottom of the other side was the office and parking lot. The night lights were all on in the parking lot it was well-lit, which is why I saw it right away. It wasn't too far away, but still a little bit of a walk. I was just glad to finally be going home."
"1192"	"(2006-01-21)"	"It was early on Sunday morning. I went to Kroger to pick up three things, tangerines, a head of lettuce and a box of thank you notes. As I walked in the door I couldn't believe how packed the store was for that early on a Sunday morning. I couldn't figure out why. You could barely get in the door for all of the shopping carts sitting ready for use. Beyond that the store was as crowded as you would see on Christmas Eve. I took a cart and proceeded. As I got inside the door I debated what my quickest strategy would be. Should I go for the cards first and then produce or the other way around? I was standing right by the lettuce so I got the head lettuce and then decided to get the thank you cards. It was hard to maneuver because there were so many people, and with shopping carts too it just felt like madness to me. I laid my white handbag in the child seat of the cart. It didn't have shoulder straps on it. I had something brown, like a brown folded bag, lying on top of it, though I don't know why. It was still easy to see the handbag. I walked away from my cart to get the thank you notes. They were on the top shelf. I had to step on something and really reach to get them. There were people everywhere and I was afraid I might bump into someone as I reached or hit someone with my arm or elbow as I came back to the floor. I kept looking both ways as I lowered myself back to the floor. I had the head of lettuce in my hands also. I just wanted to get out of there so I quickly turned and headed back to the produce section to get the tangerines. Just as I got over there I realized I had left my shopping cart sit in the other aisle, and my handbag was still in it. I panicked and practically ran back to that aisle hoping it would still be there. When I first got there I got very upset because I didn't see it. I looked in some other aisles and found it. I was very relieved and realized that I had just looked in the wrong aisle initially. "
"1193"	"(2006-01-22)"	"I went to my birth home to retrieve something I had left in my bedroom. The door was unlocked so I went into the house. The door to the attic staircase was standing open and I noticed a light on. I stood in the kitchen for a few minutes listening and wondering what to do. I finally walked over to the open door and looked up the staircase. Mother was standing on a step about halfway up. She had the upper attic door pulled open and the light in the attic was on. She was probably looking for something. The staircase looked the same as always. It was dark and cluttered. There were so many things hanging on the walls on both sides and sitting to both sides of every step that there was barely room to walk up the steps. I said hello and she turned to look at me, somewhat surprised to see me. She came down into the kitchen. I told her I had come by to get something from my room. She gave me a quizzical look. In waking life it's an hour and a half drive so I would never ""just come by."" I went into the bedroom and started looking through things trying to find whatever it was I was looking for. I was surprised by how many things I still had here. I was even more surprised that Mother had kept everything just as it was for 26 years, especially since we weren't at all close. I decided that I was going to clear everything out and take it with me. Mother came in. She didn't say anything. I'm not sure if she wanted to or if she just wanted to see what I was doing or what. It didn't really strike me as odd though as it's pretty typical behavior for her. I finally spoke, telling her that I decided I'm going to get everything out of there for her, that I'm going to take everything with me. Then she can use the room however she would like. She gave me this look that she does when she's thinking something sarcastic. She rarely says what she's thinking, and she didn't this time either. She just turned and walked out of the room. I started going through storage containers in the closet, again surprised that all of this stuff was there. In the corner by the dressing table I saw something somewhat hidden in the corner. It was pink and white and frilly. It didn't look like something I would own at all. I pulled it out. I was folded up something like today's popular camping chairs are. I pulled it open enough to realize that it was the dressing table that had been there before the one I used. I pushed it back together and placed it back in the corner. I looked at the floral bedspread and curtains. I still remember when I redecorated that room, shortly after graduating from high school. The bedspread and curtains were a large floral print with shades of yellow, green and brown. I had painted the walls a bright green. I started thinking about the bedspread and curtains. I knew that I had purchased them but I was debating whether or not she would expect me to leave them. I think the angry teenager came out a bit. I thought, heck. She made me buy my own facial tissue when I still lived at home. Why would I leave these bed linens and curtains for her when I paid for them? They certainly cost a lot more than facial tissue."
"1194"	"(2006-01-22)"	"The whole Harris family was together for Christmas at Aunt P and Aunt H's house just like we used to do years ago. I noticed Bruce W. He looked like he did as a young man, with a full head of blonde hair, trim build, and a youthful mischievous look in his eyes. Playing an old card game - ""I Hate You."" I was so distracted that I didn't hear the directions and I wasn't sure I remembered how to play. My distraction continued and I never knew when it was my turn. We were all trying to sit in one large circle but there wasn't room for all of us so some were sitting a little bit behind others. Matthew is walking around the room on crutches. He had his right leg amputated. Different people ask him if he needs help. They clearly feel very badly that this has happened to him. But Matthew has a great attitude about it, as he most often does in life. Bruce W and I were talking. I asked him if he realized or remembered how much he used to tease me or how mean he was to me at times. He seemed not to, but I can't help but wonder if he just won't admit that he does. It seems through all of the events of this dream Bruce W and I are together. There seems to be some chemistry between us. Surely not romantic as we are cousins. I remember as a little girl I thought he was cute, but that's not so unusual. His daughter Lisa W and one of his sons are there. We went to Lowe's in his van. Other members of the family went also, but in their own vehicles. His two children were in the back seat and I was in the front passenger seat. We had purchased some lumber and things. On the way back he had made arrangements for Lisa W to ride with Aunt J and for his son to ride with someone else, telling them it was because the things we bought took up to much room in the van. It was really because he wanted to have a private conversation with me, or private time. We were chatting casually and exchanging occasional glances. For lack of a better word I would say the glances were mischievous. Whatever we were talking about had nothing to do with the glances. He reached over with his right hand and lightly patted and rubbed my left knee and rested it there for just a matter of seconds before withdrawing. This had nothing to do with our conversation either. Both it and the glances seemed instead to be communicating unspoken thoughts or feelings. Maybe the connection was just a personal one, of enjoying each other's company and understanding each other. Everyone at the house was talking about doing something. We were all looking at a computer screen. It was displaying a grid of squares and in each square was a graphic depicting some type of event or place we could go. Someone said something about the winery and the majority seemed to think that was a good idea. There were three printers connected to this one computer. Someone would click on one of the squares and then print something out. This happened more than once. Bruce W and I are riding alone together going to the winery. We are talking about his parents, Aunt J and Uncle A and how sad it is that they are both now deceased. Though earlier in the dream Aunt J was still alive. I know it must be very hard for him. It's very sad for me because they were my Godparents and very special to me. Even though Uncle A died 17 years ago, I still miss him and think of him often. I think we are all still grieving Aunt J's death as it has been less than a year. We start talking about my dreamwork. I must have said something about how few people understand it or are supportive of it. He immediately jumps to my defense and tells me that I shouldn't let what others think decide what I do. He also says something that makes me think he has been paying attention to his dreams and recognizes their value."
"1195"	"(2006-01-23)"	"Intimacy with Ben D. Very erotic and sexually detailed."
"1196"	"(2006-01-25)"	"I was at home, though it didn't look like my waking life home. Some of my family was there, though Todd A is the only one I can remember. I found a VHS video and was looking at it the way you would look at negatives for photographs. I was holding the tape up to a light and moving it through my hands as I looked at it. On the tape it looked like a series of photographs. In one clip I thought I saw Nic R. I kept going and saw him again and was sure it was him. Now I'm watching the video but not on a TV or screen as you normally would, though I can't explain how I was viewing it. It was though I was just looking in the air. As I watched it, I saw Nick R at one of our family gatherings. At first we were getting ready to have a meal and he was moving around helping get everything ready and he seemed to be getting along fine with everyone. Later we are all visiting and the video is focused on Nick R. He appears to have had too much to drink. There is a sofa table sitting behind the sofa and he is lining up various types and sizes of empty bottles. Then he is taking a bottle of liquor and pouring it into each of these odd and smaller bottles. No one will ever know there is liquor in them. I realize that John S took this video without anyone knowing about it, including Nick R. He wanted me to see what Nick R was really like when I wasn't around or even when I wasn't paying attention. There's a knock at the door and I go to answer. It's Nick R. I opened the door just a little and talked to him. He wanted me to let him in and I didn't want to. He said he knew that I had a video of him but he didn't know what I was going to do with it. He wanted me to give it to him. At first I argued with him about it then I finally let him in. Todd A took the video into another room for a few minutes. When he came back he was holding the VHS cassette in one hand and a length of video tape in the other. He had torn out the section that Nick R was in and was going to give him just that much. Nick R was okay with that and left. Just a couple of minutes later there is a knock at the door and it is Nick R again. I ask him what he wants now. He said he wants to talk to me. He wants me to give him another chance. He's telling me that he has changed and if I give him another chance things will be very different than the last time. I don't believe him because he has said similar things so many times before. I'm thinking, that the video tape gives me plenty of reason not to give him another chance. But I'm also thinking that the attraction always seems to be there no matter what he does. I'm afraid the temptation to give him another chance will also always be there and I just hope I'm strong enough to stay away. I also know we argue a bit and he finally gives up and heads toward his car. Just as he reaches for the handle of the car door he stops, pauses, then turns to his left, facing me, and opens his mouth like he is about to say something. He raises his hands palms up and might have taken a step or two towards me. I raise my eyebrows as if to say, What now? He just closes his mouth and lowers his hands and gets in the car. I watch him leave. He is with family or friends. There are five other adults in the car. He gets in the passenger side of the front seat. I'm back in the other room looking at the video again, by running the tape through my hands held up to a light. I realize that Nick R is in the video at other places too but just interacting with the rest of us. There was also a section of the tape that appeared to be blank."
"1197"	"(2006-01-25)"	"I had a job interview at 96th and College. I was thinking about which streets I could take to get there that I would have the least chance of running into Bill C even though his office was either in the same building or the building next to it. I chose what I thought was the best option but still ran into him."
"1198"	"(2006-01-26)"	"I had driven my car somewhere and ran into some kind of problem and had to walk home. I think I may have walked home to get my car key. I wasn't sure I knew the way back so I just trusted my intuition. I entered a door on a building that seemed to be in a bit of disrepair. It led me through a long somewhat dark hallway. At the other end was another door. When I exited that door I realized that I had just walked through one of the front buildings of my apartment complex and was now in the very front of the complex. I turned to my left, walked to the corner, and then turned to my left again, onto the sidewalk along the main entrance. Shortly after I turned the corner I realized I didn't have my house key. I kept walking as I tried to figure out what to do. It was a time of day when the office wasn't open and maintenance wasn't around so I couldn't go ask them to let me in. I needed a phone and didn't have my cell phone with me and I really needed to use the bathroom. I thought about walking to a public place like a store or gas station but didn't want to walk that far because I really had to go to the bathroom and I was barefoot. I had left my gym shoes in the car. I finally decided to just knock on someone's door and see if they would let me use their phone. I could call the maintenance emergency number and they could come and let me in. A woman answered the door. A very pleasant, white woman. She invited me and began chatting. She seemed to welcome an opportunity to make a new friend, especially in the neighborhood. She said she would just take me to my car. At that point that seemed to be what I needed so I was very grateful. I interrupted her, apologized for doing so, and then told her I needed very badly to use the bathroom and would she mind if I used hers. She said of course not and pointed me toward it. When I finished I flushed it and watched the water rise to the very edge of the top. I wasn't sure whether I should take the tank lid off to stop it and prevent it from possibly overflowing, since I know how to do that, or if I should just do nothing. I decided to do nothing as it seemed to stop rising. I am now asleep in what I think is my own bed. I've been sleeping for some time and wake up very groggy. I stumble to the bathroom attached to the bedroom. After using the toilet, I wake up a bit more and wonder why the d_cor of the room seems so different. The walls and shower curtain have a white, blue, and brown pattern of vertical stripes with flowers randomly throughout. I walk back into the bedroom. I was completely undressed and wanted to put something on so I reach for a t-shirt that is lying on the bed. I suddenly realize I am in someone else's house and I don't even know who it is. As I am quickly trying to pull the t-shirt on I see the blankets move and realize that there is even someone else in the bed. I crouch down to the floor to try to hide but still be able to see who is in the bed. It turns out to be a teenage girl. She notices me and sits upright in bed and looks like she is about to scream. I quickly put my finger to my mouth and whisper, shhh. Please don't say anything. I said something else but I don't know what so she didn't make a sound. Then I told her that I didn't know how I got there or why. I told her I needed help with my car. She quickly got up and pushed her bedroom door closed but not all the way. She said her parents would be very upset if they knew I was there. I don't know if she meant angry or frightened. I told her I would try to leave without them seeing me. Her parents call her so she leaves the room. I'm afraid of who might come in so I try to get into a very small closet. It's hardly deep enough for me to stand with my back to the wall and close the door. When I first open the closet door it is packed with clothes and I'm afraid I won't be able to get in. It's not much wider than I am shoulder-to-shoulder. Once I got in there were only a few clothes on hangers and one very large thing that reminds me of a cushion for an outdoor chaise lounge and the closet door is only partially on its hinges. When I try to close it I can still see into the bedroom in several places. There are now quite a few people out there. It looks like a sitting room, with sofa and chairs. There is a young boy sitting on the sofa facing the closet. I can tell that he sees me and is getting ready to say something to the others. The girl comes back in and starts to tell them about me. I come out of the closet. They don't seem afraid, just surprised and/or curious. I explain as best I can what happened and that I just need a ride to my car. The girl has a teenage brother who is there and one of his friends is there. They say they will be glad to take me to my car. You can see the mischievous look in their eyes, as I am standing there with a t-shirt on and nothing else. The dad and the grandpa say they will go also, in case I need help with the car. I wish I had some more clothes to put on but there is almost nothing in the girl's closet. I ask her brother if I can borrow a pair of his pajama paints and a shirt. He and his friend kind of look around and mumble something as if they're trying to decide if they have anything that I can wear. As the dad and grandpa are ready to leave the friend decides he can't go because he has somewhere else he needs to be and then the brother decides he has homework to do so he isn't going either. The dad and grandpa try to change the brother's mind but are not successful. As we're leaving I tell them that I'm not exactly sure where the car is but I know it's somewhere within a few block radius. I didn't know the name of the street that I left it on, then or now, and told them I wasn't sure how to get back home from there when I started walking. As we're walking to get to my car there is a lot of roadwork or some such going on. We have to walk across some wood plank bridges and things similar to that. When we're crossing one of them I realize that I knew that stream was there in our neighborhood. They were a couple of times when we had to stretch our legs to get from the bridge back onto the grass. I learn that these men work in the fishing industry. We walk by a place where a lot of their coworkers are working. They are told that they are really needed right now. They tell me it won't take long and I can't wait for them. There are maybe 20 men standing in this container that looks like an orange commercial dumpster. The top edge of the dumpster is just a bit taller than the tallest men in it. A bunch of seals are about to be released into this container and all of these men need to be standing in there when they do it for the safety of the seals, though it's not to catch them or help them in. They all stand with their backs to the side where the seals are to be released into the container. This is a very dangerous part of their job. Some men have lost their lives doing this. They all realize it is a risk of their job. I am very concerned for all of them. I hate to see people having to do things that they know could cost them their life. I'm especially concerned here, though, because this dad and grandpa are going in. I wonder if their family knows about this or should be told that they are getting ready to help with this. Now the container is almost twice as deep as it was. The dad seems to be near the surface and the grandpa near the bottom. The dad asks him to change places with him because, apparently, the bottom is much more dangerous. Grandpa is standing next to some kind of mechanism that needs to be operated as the seals are released. He tells the dad no, that he needs to operate this mechanism and implies that he has lived his life and would rather he be the one to die if anyone is going to. The seals are released and are falling into the container from what looks like a waterfall stream of water coming from the transport vehicle. I head back to their house to tell the woman what is going on. I'm not sure why, but now I know that her name is Connie B. Another woman is there talking with her. The three of us are talking. This other woman says a couple of things that I don't understand, using terms or phrases that I'm not familiar with, yet it still sounds very crude, or crass, and ill-mannered. After she leaves Connie B begins talking about her and how she talks. She repeats one thing that she says and looks at me in disbelief as she asks me if I can believe she even said that. I'm just sitting there silent because I don't know what it meant. Connie B asks me if I know what it is and I shake my head no. I'm thinking that I'm not sure I even want to know, but she tells me anyway. It has something to do with bowel movements. I agree that it was very crass and unpleasant talk. I want to get my own clothes on and go home. Dad and grandpa are back and tell me that Connie B had put my clothes in the bathroom. I went in and closed the door. I wanted to use the toilet before I got dressed but saw out of the corner of my eye that there was something in it. I reached to flush it. Just as I did I realized they had put my clothes somewhere so that they had been partially hanging in the toilet. That's what I had seen out of the corner of my eye. I quickly grabbed them so the toilet wouldn't have a chance of trying to suck them down and getting clogged up or creating a problem or anything. Now I'm frustrated because I wanted to get dressed but my clothes are wet. I decide that they aren't that wet and I really want to go home so I'm just going to put them on anyway, the way they are."
"1199"	"(2006-01-27)"	"I was going to be put to death in the electric chair. There were two people in the room, I don't know if I knew them or not. They were both women. One was standing slightly in front of me and to my left, facing the wall to the right of me. She is the one that was going to pull the switch. The other one was standing just to my right by my hand, facing me. They did not seem to be okay with what was about to happen. The first time they pulled the switch it took a few seconds. My body tensed up, my head fell back and I went unconscious. They thought they had successfully killed me. Less than a minute later I began to move a little, my arms and hands, and then slowly raised my head. They couldn't believe I was still alive. They or I or both thought this was a sign that I should not be put to death. Then I was going to be put to death in an electric chair again. I don't remember the outcome that time. There was a third time. This time there seem to be a lot of people around, some of them I knew. There was a row of people standing along my right side, facing me. There were two women nearest my right hand. They were women I knew well, perhaps friends. I asked one if she would hold my hand while they did this. She couldn't. I don't know if it's because she just didn't want to or if it was painful for her to watch or to know what was about to happen or what. She just turned to her left and walked away. Then I looked at the other woman as if to say, How about you? She took my hand in hers in an effort to offer courage and comfort. Something happened and she had to leave. Now I was more upset than ever because there was no one I knew there. A man and his wife moved into the places where my two friends had been standing. They knew I wanted someone to hold my hand. They both reached out and as I tried to take one of their hands they seemed to be fighting over who should hold my hand. I was able to get a hold of two of the man's fingers and I just didn't let go."
"1200"	"(2006-01-29)"	"I had twin boys. Darren and I decide to separate. It turns out that he already had three other women in mind to replace me. He had been discussing them with his parents and his sisters to get their opinions on which one to choose. I found this out when Ray and Kay H came to see us. They weren't being very nice to me. I asked Kay H why she has never liked me. If she answered me I didn't hear it. They had brought a bunch of food with them. It was in several different containers. I thought it was odd what they had put together in some of the containers. One of the containers had something like chocolate brownies and deviled eggs. I like both so I ate one of the eggs so I could get to the brownies. I was very surprised, and yet not, when they told me which of the other women they had decided on. I was just so glad to be done with him."
"1201"	"(2006-01-31)"	"It seems more as though I knew this was going on as opposed to being involved in it or observing it. No one told me about it. Bill C had promoted Jennifer C and given her my old office. He hired another part-time person named Heather. One of the primary things they wanted Jennifer C to do was to make calls to suspects and prospects and either try to sell programs or products over the phone or setting appointments for the men. She was not successful doing this and they actually seemed surprised by this. Bill C said something about her not being able to be successful because she is timid and soft-spoken, as though they had not noticed this before, which I can't see how they couldn't have, or they wanted to change it."
"1202"	"(2006-02-01)"	"I was working with a bunch of bibliographies that were in Excel spreadsheets. I copied and pasted them all into one worksheet. I then put them in alphabetical order and went through and removed all of the duplicates. I was working with someone else on this but I don't know if it was by phone or email or if they were actually there with me. We were determining which ones were needed for DTM."
"1203"	"(2006-02-02)"	"I was working for WDF and had gone to the cafeteria. Someone I knew was at one of the tables so I went over and sat down to talk with her. She seemed to be folding laundry, though that isn't exactly accurate. She needed to go take care of something so I told her I would finish what she was doing. So she brought a huge pile of socks with no matches and dumped them on the floor by and under the table. They wouldn't have fit on the table. The socks just needed to be each folded in half and stacked in neat piles. But there were also a couple of either blankets or sheets or tablecloths. I'm not sure which. It could have been all three. As I was working on folding these things a group of employees came in with their manager. They were going to have a meeting or class in the cafeteria. The manager looked at me but didn't say anything. I decided that I would just finish as quickly as I could and then leave. Now there are some of my personal laundry items in the pile, such as a slip, bra, and panties. I tried to quickly gather them up and fold them in a way that no one would notice what they were. I wasn't concerned about the fact that I had personal items there. I just didn't want anyone to see these personal items just as I wouldn't want someone in my home to see them. As I finished folding everything, the meeting was over and two of the women there came over to talk with me. We chatted for a bit. One of them was from my department. I asked her if she was going back up to the department. She said she wasn't but wanted to know why I had asked. I told her I had hoped she could help me carry these things up because I knew I couldn't carry it all myself in one trip. She seemed to not want to be bothered but said she would. There were four piles sitting on the table. She picked up one small of the smallest and headed out the cafeteria doors and up the steps. The hallway and steps reminds me of a high school. I took the other three piles and combined them, hoping I could get the rest myself. As I tried to pick them up I realized that I couldn't reach to the bottom of the pile so I would just have to make a second trip. When I got up to the department, I was talking with some of the other employees but I don't know about what. I feel out of place, as if I don't know where I belong or what I'm supposed to be doing. Frank, from the TV show Trading Spaces came in. He is the one that had needed all of those things folded. I told him they were done and I guess I was waiting for him to tell me what to do next. He suggested I go ask Edward, from the TV show, if he had something for me to do. They were both rushing around as though they were in a big hurry, though I knew this was just the way they usually were. I spoke with Edward for a bit."
"1204"	"(2006-02-02)"	"It was the start of the last week that I would be receiving unemployment compensation, so it was the last week that I had to be available to help Bill C when he wanted. He had asked me to prepare a financial report/proposal on an idea he had. I had done the type of preparation that was typical for me, research, running numbers, etc. However, I didn't put together a full report. I went to the office to meet with him. We met in the CAS office building, but not in their office suite. Though I'm not sure where in the building we were. It was a large room with very high ceiling, well-lit, set up something like a training room. It might have been the training room that they let tenants use, except that it was located diagonally from the CAS office. The door was standing open and I could see the CAS suite from where I was sitting. Bill C came in and sat down next to me, to my right and asked me to show and tell him what I came up with. I pulled out my hand-written notes and pointed to various numbers as I told him what I found and what my recommendation was. Basically, I told him that I thought it was a good idea if implemented correctly and gave him a general explanation of what I meant by implemented correctly. As I talked he had the typical look of doubt and distrust on his face that I had become accustomed to. After I finished he stood up and began pacing a bit. Then he said he was really disappointed. I asked him to say more. He said something about the fact that it didn't seem as though I had put much time into this. I hadn't given him a typed, detailed report of what would need to be done, how, etc. I asked him why I would do that when in the past when I had done that he had just gotten angry with me for spending the time to be so thorough with a request such as this. And, that he always ended up just marking through it, as I said this I drew a large X across the entire page I had been discussing with him, and telling me that it wasn't what he wanted, or wasn't right, or wasn't good else negative. Like always, he was angry that I would say something like that and thought I was just making excuses for myself and not taking responsibility for not having done a good job. I'm sitting there thinking that he really must not see what he does otherwise he surely would see it as not taking responsibility for his own words and actions. I reminded him that this was the last week that I would be available to him and asked him if he anticipated needing anything else from me. He made some sarcastic comment related to what he believe to be the quality of what I had just brought him, implying that he would not want to ask me for anything else or that it wouldn't do him again. As he was talking I was putting my things back into my briefcase and walking towards the door. Sometime during this Bryan N had come into the room. As I pushed one of the double glass doors open I said under my breath, Yes. And you're a jerk! He heard that I said something but didn't know what I said so he said in a loud voice, What? What did you just say? I just shook my head no and kept walking. I was walking fast. I just wanted to leave and not ever go back. I heard his footsteps behind me. He didn't catch up with me, which is odd because as tall as he is and as short as I am it would have been very easy for him to catch up to me. Maybe he just stopped and decided not to pursue me. I felt I was probably leaving for the last time. I hated, as much as ever, to be parting company with him with these kinds of feelings between us, when there had been plenty of times of good, warm, caring, respectful feelings between us over the last 3.5 years."
"1205"	"(2006-02-05)"	"Went for a weekend retreat with Macy F at the BE Retreat Center. Lisa from the TV program dance with the stars was there as was her husband. It must have been a family retreat as there were quite a few children there. Macy F and I each had our own room. She asked me about going to dinner and I told her, if she didn't mind I would like to stay in my room this evening and spend some quiet time alone. She was fine with that. There were a lot of people there. Sister Betty was there. I had met with her briefly. They were hosting some type of social. Many people were drinking champagne. I had picked up several bottles, looking for one that was open. As I was doing this someone walked up and very easily removed the top from one of them - not the way you would normally open a bottle of champagne. I thought that if I had known that I could have done it myself. Someone had taken a champagne bottle that was only partially full and added something to it. It looked like a root beer float might look except that it was shades of red, white, and pink. It did have ice cream in it. I took one of these and poured some into a smaller bottle to take up to my room with me."
"1206"	"(2006-02-05)"	"I was talking to Reid W. He mentioned his wife. A little while later he said he needed to leave - I think to pick up his daughter."
"1207"	"(2006-02-06)"	"Social at St. Monica's. I was with a lot of my family at St. Monica's at some type of social events were inside a building or house. There were people from various races there. There was a little girl, African-American, about two or three years old. She was standing next to a mud puddle. In the center of this big mud puddle was a little toddler's chair. Her mother kept telling her to stay away, afraid that she was going to fall into the puddle and get covered with mud, but she wanted that chair. She kept trying to reach over the mud puddle to get it. The chair was covered in mud, halfway up. I finally spoke up and said that I had a garden hose in my trunk, and I would go get it. We could wash the chair off so that the little girl could have it. They all thought this was very kind of me to do this, making it sound like it was a lot of trouble but it wasn't. Or at least I didn't want them to know that it was any trouble. I went out to my car and opened my trunk. It was full of garden stuff. There were several different hoses, and I don't know what all was in there. It wasn't a trunk like you would see in waking life. It was as if it had three different levels. Kind of shelving, if you will, and it also had places on the side where you could hang things. I had one garden hose lying in the bottom of the trunk. I picked that one up. Someone was with me. I said that was not the one to use because I thought it had a leak in it. I thought for a minute about using it anyway but then I saw another one hanging to the side. I decided I would try to get to it so we could use it instead. I was having trouble reaching it. I had to climb partially into the trunk to get it out. As I was pulling it out, I realized that it didn't have a nozzle on either end of it. I decided I could just hold my figure partially across the end of it to get the force that I was looking for to clean the chair. We went back to the building and went inside. We were going to hook up the hose and clean the chair. I suggested that it would be better if we took the chair outside but we could keep the hose hooked up inside. We started dragging it outside. At this point the hose doesn't look like a typical garden hose. It's probably closer to two to 3 inches in diameter, and it looks more like a dryer hose. It has that kind of expandable feature to it. Someone had drug if through the mud puddle and so there were spots of it that had mud all over it. I told the others to be careful because I didn't want to get mud all over the floor. I was now back at my trunk looking for something else, but I don't know what. I climbed into the trunk and am lying on my back. I'm trying to reach something from the back that is on the third level or this third shelf or whatever it is. There isn't much space between itself and the top of the trunk, and there's only room for me to barely see on that shelf and reach my arm up and around to get whatever's on it. It seems like I'm trying to get yet another hose. Now there are quite a few of us who are helping with some kind of project that seems to be outside. We are talking about the parish and someone questions why I'm not a member of this parish. I think I give them a very vague answer because I don't want to tell them the truth. I just want to be nice. I didn't want to tell them that I was offended by my new member registration meeting there. There were a bunch of flowers in pots that they wanted people to take home with them. Someone suggested I take one of them home with me. I'm not sure why but I hesitated to do so, but I finally and reluctantly agreed."
"1208"	"(2006-02-06)"	"I received a call from Freda L asking me if I wanted to go to Florida and join her and Susan J and Dorothea D there. She said something about Thursday, I asked which Thursday. She said, this Thursday. I said, Thursday of this week? Because it was already Monday or Tuesday, and I couldn't believe she would be asking me to do this with such short notice. She confirmed that she meant this Thursday. She went on to explain that the three of them were on a train on their way to Florida, and they thought it might be fun if I could join them for a long weekend - Thursday through Sunday. I hesitated, debating in my mind whether I wanted to do this for several reasons. The first reason was that I wondered why they hadn't invited me to wherever they were coming from on the train. The second reason was that it was such short notice. The third reason was finances. I didn't know that I really wanted to tell them that I wasn't working right now or that I was having financial problems. After all, if I had been successful these past years finances shouldn't be a problem, right? I could tell she was a bit put off by my hesitancy. I'm on the train with them, Uncle J and Aunt A are there as well, which I found very odd. It seems that wherever they had been they had all been there together. They were all sharing a suite on this train. I was surprised by how spacious this area was. In one part of the suite there was a table with bench seating kind of like a booth you would see in a restaurant. Uncle J and Aunt A came in and sat down at that table. There were also a lot of small children running around. I don't know if they were Susan J and Dorothea D's children or grandchildren. I think they were grandchildren. As we were talking they told me that they were only paying nine dollars a night for this train suite. I thought that would've been affordable for me. As we continue to talk, they told me about a conference they had attended, and that this is where they were returning from. It still doesn't make sense to me that this particular group of people had attended a conference together. So my feelings are still hurt about this."
"1209"	"(2006-02-07)"	"I was working for a company that published some type of periodical, like a monthly magazine. I was looking for some article or information and I had to go back and look through each issue individually, one at a time. They have some software set up for this, but still it only searched one month at a time. Other than that it was a typical kind of search engine. When you went in to do your search, it would pull up a list of blue hyperlinks with one or two sentences after each. I had to try to figure out which one was the right category to look in for what I was looking for. There were one or more other people there, and we were having a conversation about whatever I was looking for and whether or not there was a way to find it and then discussing this search capability, and how it was working."
"1210"	"(2006-02-09)"	"I don't know who the people were, but someone was trying to break into the apartment. In the dream I was thinking to myself, OK, please God, help me get out of this bed and to the door in time to get to the bedroom door on time so I can lock it. If they could break in through the front door, I don't know why I thought they couldn't break in through my bedroom door. I was in one of those states where I couldn't move, and then I woke up. Then I went back to sleep. This time it was a group of maintenance people from the apartment community. I even had the front door chained. First they came up to the neighbor's front door and mine. They were banging on them with their fists. That alone scared me because it was during the night. I couldn't imagine why anyone would be banging on my door like that in the middle of the night. I was worried that something was very wrong but I still didn't want to go down and answer it because I didn't know who it was or what they wanted. I later found out it was the maintenance guys. They managed to get in. I don't know if they managed to break the chain or if they got it off or what they did with it. I was lying on my right side so I couldn't see if someone came in my bedroom without moving, but I was sure they had come in. I felt them standing by my bed behind me. I didn't move, hoping they would think I was asleep and leave me alone. I woke up again. When I went back to sleep this time I knew someone was breaking into the apartment, but I didn't know who it was. They didn't make a lot of noise I just knew that someone had gotten in and was on their way upstairs. I was lying on my right side again, so again, I couldn't see if someone entered the room or not. This time I wasn't sure but I was too afraid to turn to see."
"1211"	"(2006-02-09)"	"I was lying in bed with Darren. I was lying on my left side, his right arm under my head and my right hand resting on his chest. We were just lying there awake. I don't know if we were actually having a conversation or if we were both just lying there awake thinking about things. He suddenly got out of bed and started getting dressed. He said he was going to meet someone that he was going to propose to. I wasn't surprised by this at all, and I don't know that it really bothered me. I suppose we had already agreed to get a divorce, and he just wasn't going to wait until it was final before getting engaged again. He came back a little later with his parents. Kay H had brought containers of food with her. They were rectangular, clear, plastic storage containers with snap on lids. We're helping to carry them into the house. As we were doing so, we were talking about Darren being interested in three different women and trying to decide which of the three he should propose to. As is typical for Kay H, she was being very vocal in her opinion, and thought she knew exactly which one was the best choice. She was going on and on about this and other things, but I don't remember what she actually said. Something she said prompted me to say something to her. I looked at her and said, Kay H, why have you never liked me? Why have you always had such a problem with me? I was looking in some of the containers that we were carrying in to see what kind of food as in them. Mostly it was hors d'oeuvres and snack type items, but I was surprised at the things that she had combined into one container. For example, one container had something chocolate, maybe brownies. But then she also had deviled eggs sitting on top of them. I really wanted a brownie and since I like deviled eggs anyway, I went ahead and ate an egg first so I could get to one of the brownies. I bought a condo and was packing and getting ready to move. I opened a piece of furniture that was something like an armoire, but it only had one door on the front. Inside there were three shelves and they were spaced about 12 to 18 inches apart. I was taking out all of Darren's clothes. In the back, on one of the shelves, there was a styrofoam bust that had a button front dress shirt and necktie on it. The shirt was buttoned up, and the necktie was tied as if someone were wearing it. After I pulled it out, I noticed that there were several more. Darren was there now and he said if I didn't mind he would really like to keep those. I told him that was fine. I really didn't have any need for them. There were also a lot of straight pins in them, but I don't know why. The maintenance staff was preparing to host some type of Hawaiian theme party. One of the men had a truck, and he had a lot of party supplies and decorations in the truck. Of course, fitting the Hawaiian theme. I had the impression that he had found a number of these things in dumpsters. The truck started rolling down a hill and ran into something. It was rolling into what looks like a huge rubber tire. Maybe it was the rubber tire on a semi truck. Each time it rolled forward it would hit this tire. It would bounce back, and then roll forward again and bounce back. This just kept repeating. I told Bob F to run after it. He didn't really run. It was not even really a slow jog. I thought if he could get to the truck he could get in as it was hitting the tire. Then he could shut it off. But he didn't get over there and he didn't shut it off. A lot of my family members were at the condo helping me unpack. There was some kind of problem with the window treatments. I know Daddy, Bev, and Bob F were there. There were others there, but those three are the only ones that I can actually picture or remember specifically. There are also several tall stacks of clear plastic storage containers, and they have different things in them. I'm talking to someone about what is in them and what to do with them."
"1212"	"(2006-02-10)"	"Matthew was about six or seven years old. He was wearing a pair of shorts and a white T-shirt. I was sitting in my favorite chair in the living room, and he came running in and jumped up in my lap. He was sitting with the back of his head resting on my left arm, and I slid my right arm under his knees and kind of pulled him closer to me, and in a semi fetal position. I said something to him either about how much I loved him or how important he was or both. He just gave me a sweet smile. Then later, he comes downstairs and he is holding something in his right hand that is about the size of a posterboard and he has something in his left hand as well. I ask him what he's doing and he says he is going to color except that's not the word he used. I don't remember the word that he used. It wasn't a normal word. Nothing I'd heard before, but in the dream I knew what he meant. He was sitting at the coffee-table coloring like he always used to do. I was sitting in my favorite chair. He asked me if I wanted to color with him, and I said I didn't know. I was really in a funk. The best way I can describe it is to say that sometimes I just get this feeling. It's a feeling of uneasiness or unrest, or as if something bad is about to happen. It's a very odd feeling and I can never identify what's causing it."
"1213"	"(2006-02-10)"	"I was working at the computer with a bunch of different files for the doctors. I was moving them around getting all the files in the right places. It was taking me a while and I was concerned that I wasn't going to get it done in time for them. One of them said that I just needed to finish it by the end of business on Friday, then they would have the weekend and Monday to review it before they needed it on Tuesday."
"1214"	"(2006-02-10)"	"I started a new job for a relatively small company. They had maybe 12 employees. On the first day they were having a staff meeting in a room that looks kind of like a very small cafeteria or dining room. It had the typical six-foot long tables and folding chairs. The tables were displaced randomly in the room and very close together. They weren't in rows or anything like that. When people were sitting at the tables, some of them were sitting back to back. There was very little room to move between them. I noticed how dirty the tables and the floor were. It looked like people had been having meals there and never cleaning up. The owner came in and started the meeting. He had a number of handouts. I was feeling surprised by how unorganized they were. Each of the handouts had multiple pages, but some of them had not been stapled together yet. Nobody seemed to know what anybody else was doing. They were trying to pass around the handouts, but not in one direction around the table as you might expect. They were handing them off in all different directions, causing some people to not get them. I realized at one point that I was holding a stack of identical copies when I thought I just had one copy of each handout. I realized that there was another stack there that needed to be passed around, that no one had mentioned. There are a number of things that the owner said that started getting me very concerned about being there. I started to feel like I had made a bad decision to come to work here. He was talking about the company web site. I don't know if I had seen it or if I just made this judgment based on what he was saying, but it was a very simple and what I considered ineffective web site. I didn't believe it was going to be worth the money they put into it because they didn't put enough into it. I thought I might talk to him about using Jeff K, but then realized immediately that he was not going to have the money to invest in Jeff K's fees. I had a feeling he would be much like Bill C when it came to websites. I began to think it would be best for everyone if I just resigned right away."
"1215"	"(2006-02-11)"	"I was with Ben D but I don't know where we were. He was telling me that he had gotten an attractive job offer in the city where I live and was planning to move here. Actually, he didn't say planning to; he said he was going to move here. My immediate reaction was just that I didn't know how I felt about that. There was part of me that was excited that I would have the opportunity to see him more. Because he implied that one of the reasons he was accepting the offer was the opportunity to spend more time with me. There was part of me that wasn't excited at all actually more fearful let's say, because of my own feelings about relationships of this type. I was concerned that he may want more from me in terms of my time, or even commitment that I feel prepared to give."
"1216"	"(2006-02-11)"	"There were two men who had been sharing an office. I don't know if they were business partners or if they were coworkers or if they were two professors who shared an office. At times, it felt like I was an officer of her what was going on at other times it felt like I was hoping with the move as a friend or acquaintance, and at other times it felt like I was the wife or partner of one of these two men. This must've been part of previous dream. During most of the dream, I don't remember any specific record mission of who these men were but towards the end of the dream. I realize that the one that I was helping was Barry C and I was very disappointed by and actually somewhat upset by this. As bad as it may sound, I didn't want to be helping him. And I certainly didn't want him to be in a position to be bothering me more. Towards the end of the dream it was two women, instead of two men, and there were no families involved. When it was two men, there was a wife involved of the man who was moving out, and there was at least one son of that same man who was involved. It wasn't an amicable separation between the two men. The man who is staying was not at all happy about this. I don't remember anything about his marital status or about whether he had a family are not. Because it wasn't an amicable separation there was a lot of disagreement and hard feelings about separating the material things. There was argument about which furniture belonged to whom or which furnishings belong to know. There were a lot of pictures and paper mementos and those types of things hanging on the walls. There was a lot of disagreement about who would get which of those items. The man who was moving out had an adult son who came to help him move. He was only moving to another part of the same building. Actually just one floor up. At times, this felt like a hospital and at other times it felt like a university. This next part is a little hard to describe because it's like I was observing it but I wasn't in the same room. Or that I knew the conversation was going on or overheard the conversation yet visibly was not in the position where I could see or over hear it. But there was a young couple married couple, I believe, who were being romantic, though not necessarily intimate. And they were discussing making love in a room in this facility that no one would dare to do such a thing and that it would be very disrespectful to do that in that room. But the very nature of it being forbidden is what made it more enticing to them. It almost feels like it was a chapel. It was located on the same floor as this one man's new office, maybe even next-door to it. When they heard that this man was moving into this new office, they were joking around about him going into the chapel to make love to someone. The wife of the man who was moving was there helping him to move. At this point I am also actually helping with the move. The pictures and paper mementos and articles and things hanging on the wall. There was a bunch of them. On two of the walls, they seemed to nearly cover the walls. They were all hung up with thumb tacks. I was just going along the wall pulling out tacks and taking some of them down. I was randomly choosing about half of what was there, unless I saw something with one of the men names on it. If the item had a name on it, I decided whether or not to pull it down based on whose name was on it. There were some items that I didn't think I should take down randomly, but I didn't know who they belong to. So I would ask one or the other. The man who is staying would rarely answer me or if he did it was a mumble or a grumpy answer. When we were moving some of the furniture items it was the same way, if we ask the question about a particular piece of furniture or about a table lamp. He responded pretty much the same way. One of the things that strikes me as interesting right now is that this was a very small, two room office. Yet by the time we had moved all of the things that were going to be moved to the new office the room was so full you could hardly move around. We had things stacked on top of things. There was no way all this stuff could have been in the shared office. To get to the new office we went out a door and up two flights of wooden steps. They were a dark finished wood. Yet there was also point in the dream where the adult son of this man came because there were no steps to get to this new office. It was as though it was a hill of sand. The son came to build steps. Although in the dream it showed up in the order that I recorded it - the steps were there first and then the son showed up to build the steps. A couple of times during this move, I had to use the bathroom. If we went out the door from the office we were moving out of, the men's room was right to our right around the corner. The women room, however, was down a floor and around a corner to the left. I approached the door slowly because I wasn't sure where it was and then because I didn't know if it was a single restroom or if it was a public restroom with multiple stalls. When I went inside I saw it was a very large public restroom with multiple stalls, but nothing like you would typically see. There were three walls around each stall that only came up waist high. And there was no door or enclosure on the front. So you could see exactly who is using each stall. Actually the half walls only came up, maybe 12 inches higher than the top of the toilet seat. There was a maintenance woman in there working. I think there were three or four stalls in this room. Two or three of them were being used. I was hesitant to use one because there was no privacy and because they all looked messy and nasty. Once there is no one else in there, I decided to go ahead and use one. So I walk by them all to see the one that was the least nasty of them. It seemed I went down here more than once, though. It seems like there was also something about the man who was moving out or myself or both of us having private living quarters in this building. But it was just a single room like a bedroom. I keep seeing the color pink, but I have no idea where it's from. And I see a lot of white. Most of it, however just appears to be a very old well cared for building with a lot of wood features, the stairs, the banister, wood trim."
"1217"	"(2006-02-11)"	"I had gone into the office hoping to clear out all of my personal things, while no one was there. Bill C showed up and was surprised to see me. I told him why I was there, that I had just hoped to clear out my things while no one was there. He said that was fine, yet he seemed suspicious. As I was trying to clear out my things, we got into a debate, if you will. I was trying not to say anything mean or hurtful to him or about him or about Bryan N. But that was very difficult because of the things that he was saying to me. I wanted to tell him that I knew more than he realized about the whole situation. I wanted to tell him that he really didn't know much about what Bryan N was actually doing. Or how Brian F has been manipulating him, or using him or the things Bryan N has been saying behind his back. I just felt myself getting more and more upset and I wanted to get out of there. Ben D came in and was helping to clear out my desk while I was having this discussion with Bill C. Occasionally I would stop and tell him where some of my things were so he could put them into boxes. I told him that everything in the top right and left hand drawers belong to me. I think at one point I realized that he had completely emptied one drawer where everything didn't belong to me, but at what point I was so upset that I didn't care. So I just let it go. I wasn't feeling well and Ben D knew this so he was rushing trying to help me get out of there as quickly as possible."
"1218"	"(2006-02-11)"	"Ben D and I were in a vehicle that reminded me of an ambulance. The front seat, where the driver would be, was a bench seat that stretched across the vehicle. Ben D was driving and I was sitting in the center of the seat right next to him. I had been resting my head on his shoulder sleeping. I was partially awake and I reached over with my left hand and put my hand on his leg. I was thinking how glad I was that he was there. I was thinking how glad I was that I wasn't just dreaming it. For some reason I knew that the vehicle needed to be moved quickly so I moved over into the driver seat with the intention of driving it myself. However, as I was sliding into the driver seat I realized that it was a stick shift, and I didn't know how to drive a stick shift. But I really didn't have any choice, so I just started it up and tried to drive it. I was surprised at how well I did. I didn't have any problems at all."

"1220"	"(2006-02-12)"	"I was at my computer getting ready to send an e-mail to Bill C. I. wanted to verify that he did in fact, want me to show up for work this coming week, Monday through Wednesday. I knew it was my last week but for some reason I wasn't sure that he actually wanted me to come into the office. Just as I was getting ready to write the e-mail Matthew walked up, and so I stopped. I wanted privacy writing this e-mail. I'm not sure what Matthew wanted. He looked at me funny, like he was wondering why I stopped what I was doing. I told him I was getting ready to write this e-mail and I really would rather do it in private. He walked away, and I was getting ready to start again, and Ashley B walked up. Again, I didn't want to send the e-mail or write the e-mail with anyone around. There is a table to my right and slightly behind me and there was a big platter of fried chicken on it. I told Matthew it looked really good and that I would love to have the drumstick."
"1221"	"(2006-02-12)"	"I was a member of a family in some past century. Me being as bad with history as I am. I couldn't tell you when. It was a time of castles, when women only wore dresses and only rode horses sidesaddle. The details of this are very sketchy. I believe that I was just a teenager. Myself and a male friend of mine went someplace. Each of us riding our own horse. There is something to this about a romance or a possible romance or a suspected romance or a hoped-for romance between myself and this male friend. And that somehow involved my parents. Maybe they were just discussing it and the fact that they were okay with it. Or maybe they were the ones hoping for it. A third male friend entered the picture at some point in time. I had a very close relationship with my father. And a good relationship with my mother. A battle had broken out, and my father was actually involved in it. I was very concerned about his safety. We later receive news that he had been killed. I was incredibly distraught. Myself and my two male friends decided that we were going to go avenge my father. I entered a secret room of the castle, and as I slowly entered the room I saw that there was a large group of men gathered there. As I scanned the room my eyes met my father's is he quickly rushed to meet me. He told me that no one was to know he was alive. That they wanted the people who had tried to kill him to believe that he really was dead. He left this meeting in went into hiding in a very small room. The room was only big enough that perhaps six people could stand in it. It was rectangular in shape, and the two short sides of the rectangle or walls. The two long sides were double doors. Someone was chasing me. In one section of the castle there was a very long row of the small rooms with double doors on each side. The doors were on swinging hinges. I was just running through them one after the other after the other. And managing to just stay a few rooms ahead of whoever was chasing me. Meanwhile my two male friends took off on their horses with weapons to avenge my father. The people who had tried to kill my father had entered the castle. I don't know who they were after, because they still believe that my father was already dead. Whoever it was that they were after, they thought they had cornered in the small room where my father was hiding. So they just showered the double doors with gunshot. This obviously, did kill my father. I managed to escape whoever was chasing me and I found my mother. She is the one who told me that my father had actually just been killed. Now we were more distraught than ever because we thought that he had escaped and now had actually been killed. When my mother had first come to live in this place she had very few possessions. She was now having one of our servants gather up those meager possessions that she had come here with and was preparing for us to go back to where she had lived originally. I was an only child. A neighboring businessman didn't want us to leave. He came to the castle and was trying to convince my mother to stay. He wanted us to live with his family, and he wanted my mother to work for him. It seems that she had a talent for something like baking or sewing or something artistic. He knew that her using this talent would be very good for her and would be good for his business as well. She finally agreed so he was helping us to box up our possessions to move. He found something on a high shelf. I don't know if it was a piece of paper, or a piece of fabric. It had a picture of someone that reminds me of Aunt Jemima. And it had some words on it. It was apparently something of value. He said he couldn't believe that she still had one of those, or that one of those was still around. "
"1222"	"(2006-02-15)"	"I was with mother and daddy and one of my sisters at my parent's house. He was explaining to me and my sister that we were going to have to take care of mother. I don't know if this was a one-time thing, or if he was preparing us to take care of her, should he be the one to die before her. This obviously made me and my sister very uncomfortable, the idea of having to take care of her colostomy. She was laying in her bed, on her back, completely undressed, and covered with a blanket. He was explaining how we would have to turn her over to her side. Before he started showing us how to take care of her colostomy, she got up and walked away. I was surprised that it didn't bother her to get out of bed completely unclothed in front of myself and my sister."
"1223"	"(2006-02-18)"	"I am riding some type of public transportation downtown. A few blocks ahead of me I see something that reminds me of a vendor area that you would see at a carnival. It was a large square area, and each side of the square looked like the kind of display case that you would see in a bakery. Inside the square is where the people who were running it were working, and there were customers along each of the four sides on the outside. They were selling things that you would find at a carnival such as cotton candy. There is also a tent like awning over the top of it to protect it from the weather. As we were getting closer to it I heard someone say that they were also revitalizing the main square at broad ripple. Just as I heard them say that I looked to my right and I could see down that street at the end was the main square at BR. I left the public transportation at the car will stand downtown. I saw Mother there. She was upset with me because I haven't been going to see her often enough. Now were riding through the main square or at broad report. Now I'm telling someone else that they had revitalized this area, and that they had refurbished all of the storefronts. As I was talking, I kind of nodded my head out the window to my right, indicating to them to look out the window to see what I was talking about. They had used a common theme in refurbishing the storefronts. They almost had a storybook or fairy tale look to them. Since mother was upset with me I went to my birth home for a visit. I went into use the bathroom. There was a pair of knee-high stockings with the toe end just slightly in the water in the toilet bowl. The water was urine filled, as someone had neglected to flush the toilet when they used it last. I picked up the other end of the stockings and help them, so the toe and was still dangling in the water as I flushed the toilet, using the clean water to rinse out the end of the stockings. Now there is a big ball of various types of stockings in the toilet bowl. It's about the size of a basketball. I actually didn't realize that those were there until I tried to flush the toilet a second time and I either realized it was stopped upper morning to get stopped up an overflow. And once again the toilet bowl water is urine filled. I find a way to get and I reach it under this ball of stockings to lift it out and on to the countertop. Of course taking it from the toilet bowl to the countertop water dripped various places. As I lay them on the counter all of the water started to run out. There was a pile of towels, unfolded, lying nearby. So I grabbed those towels and placed them around the stockings to keep the water from running off the counter onto the floor."
"1224"	"(2006-02-18)"	"I went to a house. I don't know whose it was. I noticed a child there playing with something very unusual. They are objects that look, as best I can describe, as bubbles from a bubble bath. However, they aren't all white. They are in various colors and some of them have numerous colors on each one. They were also animated. I was talking to a man who had something to do with these things. Maybe he was the creator. Although I have a sense that he may have been the caretaker. Or perhaps both. He was telling me about them. They started out as this thing that is slightly smaller than a matchstick, but made of clay. When certain things happen, it causes them to begin to grow or to turn into these bubble like things. They start expanding and they come to life. As they do they become various shapes and sizes and colors. As he was explaining this to me there was one laying on the floor by my feet. I don't know what it was, maybe music started playing. Whichever it was, this thing started to expand and grow and come to life, and it took on the shape of a snake. About 6 feet long, about 6 inches in diameter, and grass green in color. And as he grew it began coiling around things. It didn't happen very quickly, though. It would grow a few inches and then stopped. And then a few more inches and stopped. And then it finally grew to the six-foot length. I had three of these things laying in the palm of my hand, because something was wrong with them. One of them actually looks like a match stick in that it had a little lack on ball kind of on the end of it. I also had a small bag made out of some kind of fabric. I had stuck each one to the upper inside edge of this bag for safekeeping. I didn't need to use anything to make them stick. They just automatically stuck as if they were made of Velcro. I noticed another one of the things lying in the bottom of this bag, so I reached in to get it. As I did that however, I knocked one of the others off that I had stuck to the inside. After attempting several times to reach the one playing in the bottom without knocking the ones off on the side, I finally just took them all off and laid them in the palm of my hand. I was going to take them someplace to either have something done with them or where they would be safe or where they could all be brought to life. After the ones that were in the palm of my hand came to life. I started going to other rooms of the House. They seem to be all over the house. As I said earlier they were various shapes and sizes and colors. For example one was mostly white and looked like a teddy bear. Some of them were multicolored, and reminded me of Christmas nutcrackers. Some of them were bigger than I am. Some of them had no recognizable form. I'm not sure when this occurred, but somewhere in here there was an outdoor display. It looked like a huge white poster board. It had pictures of several of these things. The ones that were pictured had faces and names. People were coming up in looking at the display to determine which ones they wanted to purchase. Some people apparently collected these and already had some of them. So they wanted to see which ones they didn't have yet so they could purchase those. When people bought them, they bought them, though in their little matchstick form. The house was two-story. There were other people in the house. Several times while I was there I had to use the bathroom. I was getting aggravated, because I had to go so often. I know at least once there was someone standing outside the door waiting for me to finish so they could use it. One time it was a mother and her little girl. I heard the mother tell the little girl that she just had to wait her turn because someone else was in there. As soon as they heard me flush the toilet the little girl came in. It was more like a private bathroom that you would find a house than a public one. As the little girl came in, I reached for some toilet paper and wanted it up to wipe off the seat just to make sure that it was clean and dry for the little girl. When I left the bathroom I heard music playing. There was an LP album playing on an old stereo. Because this music was playing it was bringing all of these things in this house to life. Actually, I may have been the one to turn the music on because I knew it would bring these things to life. I started gathering them all up and placing them in kind of a parade formation. So they would be moving together and in the same direction. I ran ahead of them downstairs to this man and told him to come over to the bottom of the stairs and look up. As he did so, he saw all these things parading down the steps. The steps were covered with these things from side to side and top to bottom, and at the top of the stairs, they kind of fanned out in width. I was getting ready to leave so I picked it up to jackets that I had with me and threw them over my arm and got ready to leave. But before he did I thought of something else that I needed or wanted, and so I went back inside. It was late evening and the man wanted to go to sleep. He was upset because all of these things were still moving around being active. I went and looked at the record player and saw that it was playing the last song. So I went into the man's bedside and told him that so he would know that the things would be quieting down soon. I was getting ready to leave again but decided that I wanted to use the bathroom, one more time, which was upstairs. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there was a rod-pocket curtain hanging from the ceiling. It was the width of the stairwell and a dark green color. There was another coat lying there, which I picked up and threw over my arm and decided to take upstairs with me. I very gently pull the curtain back because I didn't want to disturb any of these things. But as careful as I was I still woke up the teddy bear, which had been sitting right at the bottom of the steps on the other side of this curtain. The stairwell was pitch black dark. Since I'm afraid of the dark, I was very hesitant to climb the steps. But I really wanted to use the bathroom before I left. The teddy bear starter walking up the steps in front of me, which made it easier for me and made it feel safer. After I finished using the bathroom I went back into the man to let him know that I'm leaving and told him that the teddy bear was still wandering about. He and I both knew though that as soon as I left the teddy bear would go back to sleep or whatever."
"1225"	"(2006-02-18)"	"I was working at the computer, and I had a separate file for each of the seven different sections of my dissertation. I was cutting and pasting text from one section into another, trying to get everything where I felt it really belonged. I had the idea that I should add another chapter, which would express only Freud and Jung's perspectives on each of these sections. Or, what I might imagine their perspective to be on each of these sections. I should also move my researchers observations from Chapter 4 into Chapter 5 and combine it with what is now in Chapter 5 as overview."
"1226"	"(2006-02-18)"	"I was in a room that looked like a school cafeteria. It was a very large room and there were many people there. I was there for a council meeting but the meeting hadn't begun yet. There may have been a set amount of social time scheduled for before or after the meeting as people are gathered in small groups chatting. I was on some kind of a bereavement sub-committee. I was sitting with a group of people discussing something related to this. Aunt R's name came up. She passed away in July of 2005. We had received quite a few letters addressed to her. They had been written after her death and from people wanting her to answer some questions for them. Mostly they were questions about the afterlife but some were questions about her own life. I thought this was absolutely absurd. What did they think we were going to do with these? How did they think she was going to answer these questions? She might answer them in a dream, but then why send the letters to us? I told someone in the group that we had to decide what to do with these letters. One woman got up and left to do something related to our discussion. I saw someone enter the room. Maybe it was Father Jerry. I thought he could tell us what we should do."

They said it as if they couldn't believe the simplicity of my kitchen or the small number of things I have. I said that I do have larger bowls. I was thinking of some larger Tupperware bowls that I have but I knew I had moved them to a different place recently because I so rarely use them. I was trying to remember where I put them."
"1229"	"(2006-02-22)"	"I was working at a hospital. The only other person that I knew was Doctor C. I have the image of the area of the hospital where he was working. It was a reception area or check-in area. To the left of that there was an area where a doctor was working at a desk or counter, on a computer I think. There is something about someone thinking that Doctor C had been killed, but he hadn't. Someone decided that it would be safer for him to just let everyone believe that he had been killed. He could get a new identity to continue his life without being found. I had stayed in a hotel room for one or two nights. When I was getting ready to leave, I was putting a bunch of trash in a small, brown paper bag. I have five or six different beverage containers, small plastic and glass bottles, that I put in there. I was surprised that I had so many. There was some kind of problem related to the hotel or it's just part of the dream that I can't remember now. There was also a problem at the hospital, besides whatever happened to make people think that Doctor C had been killed. The other doctor that was working in that one area had actually either been killed or died. His wife came to the hospital. Someone had picked up the phone and was going to call someone to take over his work. His wife put her hand on theirs and put the phone down. She said she was going to take care of it or do it. There is someone hiding under a counter behind the public area, but I don't know who it is or why they're hiding. I'm with Doctor C, and we were talking about everything that has been happening. Since even his wife thinks he is dead, he convinces me that it's OK for us to be together in a relationship. We're walking someplace and holding hands. He wants to go back into the hospital to check on one of his patients. I'm very concerned about this because I know if he is seen it is going to cause a big problem for him. We go into the hospital, and there is a bank of elevators. They are lined up along a curved wall. This hallway seems to have a low ceiling and is fairly dark. Doctor C reaches and pushes the button for one of the elevators. As the doors open we see someone on it and so we quickly duck away so they don't see him. This happens at least one more time before we actually get on an elevator and go up to see his patient. After he finishes we go back to the bank of elevators and the same thing happens again. When we get back downstairs and get off the elevator we see that they have blocked off several of the hallways with either policeman or security guards. They know that Doctor C is still alive and are trying to catch him. As we figure out a way to get past them and get outside the hospital they spot us. But we figure out some way to convince them that it isn't really him. Now we're in another part of the hospital. There are a lot of nurses and hospital workers around. We aren't really concerned about it because we know they are too busy and not really even paying attention. Even if they were we know that most of them wouldn't even know who he was. We approach another area of the hospital where all of the workers have been notified to watch for him. They all know him and are being very alert and watchful. Someone suggested that we just needed a good way to distract them so he can get past them and outside. Somehow we got a bunch of pens. They were very simple stick pens in various bright colors. So I walked ahead of Doctor C and was handing out handfuls of these pens to these workers. I walked by an island counter and dropped a bunch of them on the counter and kept walking. The staff ran over to the counter. They got so excited about them that it successfully distracted them so that Doctor C could get by each group as I gave out the pens. Now he and I are walking outside, again holding hands. His two sons are with us now, but they are adults. They are walking behind us. We're talking and joking around with them. There was something about whether or not they felt OK about their dad and I having a relationship. They seem to be okay with it though. They knew that they could not let their mom know that Doctor C was still alive. I don't know how they knew this though."

We started talking with the store manager and he asked Matthew if he wanted to work there part time. Matthew said sure so he was going to start immediately. I was walking through the store with the manager having a conversation. He was a tall man, medium build, about my age, with thick, wavy, black hair. I told him that I used to manage a CVS store. As I said it I realized that this was the store I had managed, but I didn't tell him that. The manager told Matthew he could borrow his red Porsche to take me home. We were both shocked that he would trust him to drive it. I was hesitant but wanted to trust Matthew. Matthew didn't seem to hesitate except to make sure that he was serious. After we agreed, I wondered if it was an automatic since Matthew doesn't know how to drive a stick-shift. I also thought I could drive my own car back then. But I don't know how we got there to begin with if I didn't have a car there or why I would need to come back. It is now evening and I am in the Porsche with the store manager. He is driving. We notice what appears to be a parade of cars. Each one has a flag on it representing a country and they are different on each car. Then we see a limo with several flags on it. We realize that it is the U.S. President. We were surprised that he was here."

As I walked in Jennifer C was standing at her desk. Everything was covered with something that looked like white sheets. She turned to me and must have noticed the look on my face. She explained that she had decided to start doing this every evening before she leaves work. She said it as though she thought it was a brilliant idea. I thought it looked very odd but wondered why she didn't do that while I was still there. Bill C came out to greet me and then told me I could follow him back to his office. As we walked, he said I would get to see his office now. They had made some major changes in the floor plan of the office suite. His office was now much larger and he had a conference table in it. As I sat down he was walking to another part of his office to get something. He said he had asked me to come in because he was going to be interviewing someone and he wanted me to sit in on the interview and give him my opinion afterwards."

Jo V seemed a bit hesitant but agreed. I just went back to what I was doing instead of taking care of dinner. I guess I thought what I was doing wouldn't take long and then I would go fix dinner. After awhile I went back into the living room and Jo V said they were getting ready to leave. I asked about dinner. I could tell she was a bit put off that I was not visiting with them. Then she said they would stay for dinner if it was going to be very soon because they needed to get going. "
"1237"	"(2006-03-04)"	"I went to a SXDS meeting at a huge hotel. Ona S, Wes S, Jo U. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce a new product. The producers of the new item were in attendance. It was being held in a very, very large room - almost like a ballroom. It was rather dark and there were a lot of curtains along the back wall. The rectangular tables were set up classroom style. There was significantly more room between each table than you would normally expect. The producers were in the back of the room. They were there primarily to see how well we would do introducing the product. I wanted to give each manager an order form and have them fill it out and leave it as they left the meeting to assure that we would get lots of orders. I didn't think they would have a problem with this as they were accustomed to doing this when ordering other things for the store. We had some kind of video presentation of the product. It was very theatrical. The projector was behind the curtains at the back of the room. I kept going back and forth between where the managers were and where the projector and operator were. It seems that there was a glitch that I was trying to work out. I needed to get it taken care of quickly so the producers wouldn't even realize that there was a glitch. When we got ready to leave, for some reason Jo V thought I shouldn't be walking out alone so she was going to walk out with me. She suggested that I use the restroom before we leave. I told her no but she insisted. I decided it was just as well as it had been awhile since I had been able to and I knew it was about time for my period to begin so it would better to go now than to try to wait until I got home. There was some deal about the restrooms, what was inside them or finding them. When we were finally ready to leave, the hotel was so expansive that we kept getting lost and couldn't find the way out. We would enter a hallway and Jo V thought we should be going one way and I thought we should be going another. Then we saw some celebrity sitting alone in a chair in the middle of a hallway so we stopped and asked him how to get out. He told us but I don't think we believed him. One turn we took just led us back into the meeting room where we were initially. "

"1240"	"(2006-03-11)"	"I had an informational interview at PUI with a man named Doctor Casco or Mr. Casco. When I got to the building, I found a parking spot very close to the entrance. It was metered visitor parking. I was wearing my black suit with the knee length jacket. I grabbed some change and put it in my pocket, because I saw the time had expired on the meter. So I would definitely need to put money in. I realized that I had forgotten to bring my coat so I didn't have my portfolio, umbrella, or calendar. I thought I had 80, very small note pad and pen in my handbag. So I thought maybe I would just a home. I was debating whether to take my handbag in with me or to just put the little note pad and pen in my coat pocket. I got out and went around to the passenger side of the car. It was raining and I was going to put my raincoat on. As I was putting my coat on, I saw a penny lying on the ground. I picked it up and put it in my pocket, and I saw another one and another and another and another. They were scattered around, primarily around this one parking space. I think there probably ended up being about 12 of them. I was standing in the parking space watching myself park the car in a space in front of me. I was pulling up and backing up to try to get centered into the space. I saw a penny and then saw myself move the car right on top of it. I was aggravated because I thought I wasn't going to be able to get it now. Then the me driving the car moved the car again so the me that was watching ran up and grabbed it. After I finished picking up all of the pennies I found, I reached into my suit coat pocket to collect change for the parking meter. I was having trouble though, because the pockets were really low on the jacket and I was trying to reach into the bottom of the pocket. My arms were too short. I put one coin in the meter and I was surprised by how little time it gave me. So I put another one in and saw it still had not given me very much time so I put the next one in. There was a little slot at the bottom of the meter like a change slot and money came back out, which is very odd. I pulled out the coins that came back out and put them back in again. I ended up putting in several coins before I thought I had enough time on the meter. I put in enough to give myself 40 minutes. I thought that should be plenty of time, since it was only supposed to be a 15-minute informational interview. I was running very close on time right now, because I had taken the time to pick up all those pennies. I got inside the building and it was packed with people. You could hardly walk. Because I didn't bring my calendar with me I couldn't look for the name or room number of the person I was to meet with and couldn't remember it. I heard someone standing outside the elevator asks someone else inside the elevator for directions to a specific office. As soon as I heard the answer I remembered that was the name of the office I was looking for. I rushed over to the elevator and put my hand in between the doors to keep it open long enough for me to go in. Oddly, the person inside the elevator who had answered the question was actually sitting behind a desk in the elevator. I think the office was on the fourth floor. I walked into the office. There was a heavyset woman, maybe my age, sitting at a very large round table kind of like a conference table. She was busy, but she was having a conversation with someone who was inside one of the offices to my right and slightly in front of me. There was an office with the door open and there was a man sitting in there with his back to me working at a computer. It wasn't actually his office. He had gone in there to work on something. I don't know how I know that, though. I told the woman at the table that I have a four o'clock appointment with Mr. Casco. I realized at that point I was close to 10 minutes late. I didn't apologize for that as I normally would, but she could tell by the look on my face that I felt very bad for being late. I think she told me that he was on the phone. Another woman walked out of her office. She was a very tall, heavyset, white woman was somewhat long dark hair. Her hair was not quite to her shoulders, full and kind of wavy. I would guess her to be about my age or older. She was talking to the woman at the table, saying something about the advantage of being married. She was also saying something about her husband having special advantages because he's black and two other things, but I don't remember now what those were. One of them told me that Doctor Casco was on the phone. Now I'm not sure if it was Mr. or Dr. I'm sitting in that same area talking on a phone to Doctor Casco. Instead of bringing me into his office, he decided to talk to me by phone. One of the first things he said was, ""well one of the first things I have to ask you is why there are no findings on here."" He was referring to my CV and the fact that there were no results or findings from any of my research work. I said, ""Yes that's true. Unfortunately, there weren't any. The research institute was only open for about 18 months. There were three doctors, partners, who had decided to fund and open the research institute. My experience was that they seldom agreed on the topics of research. One seemed mostly interested in making money regardless of the topic. Another seemed more interested in getting published than the topic, and the third seemed indifferent to the whole thing. There was a medical equipment research representative who was there to talk to us about a study that they were going to be doing and to interview us as a possible center to participate in their study. The doctor primarily interested in getting published told this person that was his primary interest. When asked what our goal was the first thing this doctor said was, ""well of course to get published."" I couldn't believe he responded that way. Why would they want to consider us if that is our primary concern? I think most people doing research would like to get published, but is that really a primary goal for many researchers. I certainly hope not. What does that say about your character? I would like to believe that most researchers are doing it because they hope to really accomplish something with the research and they enjoy the actual research. I didn't tell him all of that. However, I did say that after about a year they weren't happy with how it was going financially so they decided to close the institute. He said that was a shame. I agreed with him. He asked why they would do that. I said their inability to agree on what kind of research to pursue made it very difficult to pursue grants or participation in other studies - or to follow through when we did begin such a pursuit. He said that was unfortunate, but then he said he guessed he could see how that might happen. It seems that he might have put me on hold again, because I was sitting there realizing that I have another appointment and if I didn't leave very soon I was going to be late for that appointment. I was trying to decide what would be worse, to end this conversation now and get to that appointment on time, or to continue with this conversation and be late for that appointment. For some reason I didn't think I would be able to call the other people to let them know that I was going to be running late. It seemed that it would be rude for me to tell this one that I had to leave to get to another appointment on time when I was late for this one. However, I couldn't try to call the next appointment because I didn't have my appointment book with me and that's where the phone number was."

The circles are about 18 inches or more in diameter and dark in color, so you can only see the floral, where there are none of the circles. You don't actually see much of a floral print at all."
"1242"	"(2006-03-13)"	"Something about Freda L. There is a man that she was very interested in and she thought that I was interested in him also. Or, she thought I was trying to get him interested in me before she had a chance to get him interested in her. Maybe she thought I was trying to ""steal"" him from her. She looked very different than she does in waking life. Also something about my birth home. I was trying to get into the attic. There was so much stuff everywhere, including on the door that I was having a very difficult time opening it."
"1243"	"(2006-03-16)"	"It seems that I was both at Castleview Mall, and that I was going to Castleview Mall. So I'm not sure which it really was the traffic was bumper-to-bumper were driving in a very dangerous manner, and I may have been guilty of this myself as I may have made some kind of the name change or something that was dangerous. Maybe I changed lanes without using my turn signal or without there being in a room or both. It was dangerous for both me and for others, even though I ended up in the lane that I wanted or needed to be in. At one of the intersections there was someone directing traffic. I was preparing to turn right. I wasn't sure if I needed to wait for him to direct me to turn right or if I could go ahead. There were two right turn lanes. I was in the right hand of those two lanes there was a car in the lane to my two that went ahead without waiting for the traffic director to give us the go-ahead. At the same time that I decided to go ahead, the traffic Director waived us on. I had an appointment with Terry D. When I arrived, I saw that Jennifer C was working for him. I was very bothered by this. Certainly, even though he knew how I felt about anything related to CAS, he had no obligation not to hire her, simply because of me or my feelings. His office looked very different in the dream than it does in waking life. I was sitting in the reception area. On and off Jennifer C and I were talking casually. While I was waiting, Terry was cleaning a bathroom in his office. I watched him walk back and forth past the open door with different things for cleaning. Initially I was surprised to see this but then I remember him saying something to me once about cleaning his home in his tendency to be very meticulous. He said that at times he has to tell himself just get it done, rather than being so meticulous. There was something about orange slices related to him cleaning the bathroom. At first I thought that was very odd, but then I realized how many ""orange"" or citrus cleaning or household products there are on the market today. I had met a man on a blind date, and I was debating whether or not I should see him again. He happened to be coming by Terry's office to meet him. Three was going to help us decide if we should go out again to try to get to know each other. He was going to help us determine if there was much chance of us really having a successful relationship that would make another date worthwhile. I didn't tell Terry anything in advance about this man. I didn't give him any physical description. This man was a very large man. I'm guessing he was close to 7 feet tall. I would estimate him to be at least eight to 12 inches taller than Terry. He had an athletic build or medium build, not necessarily athletic. He didn't look overweight, but he was also not a small frame or thin man. Terry seemed a bit surprised when this man arrived to meet with him. He was surprised by his height. It seems that there was something else distinguishing about this man that I wondered how Terry would react to and that I was questioning myself. It might be that he was a black man. It almost seems that on my first date, he was a black man, but then when he came to meet Terry he wasn't. Maybe it was some other nationality, like Spanish or Indian. The three of us sat down to talk. Terry was doing something as we talked while I was just sitting there. This man seemed to be, maybe he was sitting alone on the sofa, because he seemed to be resting on his left elbow, in a semi reclining position. He and Terry were doing most of the talking. The first thing Terry said alluded to my anger issues. There was something related to anger. The man said, so basically what you're telling me is that she is a bomb ready to go off. I really bristled at this. I didn't like it at all. Terry said yes, that's basically what I'm saying. He started to explain. His explanation was that I really wasn't that severe. I finally spoke up and said, while looking at this man, the fact is that. I don't like people to be mad at me or not like me. So, if I do get angry with someone I can not express it for fear that they will get angry with me or not like me. Even in a healthy way. Terry said yes, exactly. Implication here is that if I don't express my feelings at the appropriate time and in a healthy manner, it could build up and that could lead to an explosion. I was in a store like Wal-Mart or target. I am walking around the household product Department. There is a couple there with their child. One of the shelves on each side of each aisle was very tall. The space between the shelves was approximately 3 feet or more. The store stocked boxes of laundry detergent that were that big on those shelves. This couple had a favorite brand that they were looking for. The store was out of stock. They were discussing this, and finally decided to get a smaller container of another brand. Although they were very reluctant to do this, because they didn't believe that it could possibly be as good as their favorite brand. I was looking for my brand but I don't know that I found it. I was also looking for another department in the store. I don't know now what that was. It's kind of like I was thinking about how something is typically done related to one particular aisle in stores in general. When I say particular aisle I mean the type of product that is typically stocked there. There was either a repetitive element or a testing element to this."
"1244"	"(2006-03-17)"	"I was with Macy F, Kim H, a mutual acquaintance of Macy F and one other woman. We were in the city where I live. We were at some public place. I baked and sold special occasion cakes. Another woman came up to me because she realized who I was and wanted to order a cake from me. She said she was having a birthday party for her adult son. The party was only a few days away but I said okay because I thought it was still plenty of time. She wanted a sheet cake and had a very specific design in mind for the top of it. She said she would get it to me in plenty of time. A couple of days later I am again with Macy F and the two other women, but Kim H isn't with us this time. We are at some business in the city where I live. I see the woman who ordered the cake and she runs up to me, saying she was so glad she had run into me and that she had planned to come and see me to give me the design for the cake. I suddenly realized that I had forgotten all about needing to do this cake. She needed it delivered by 11:00 am the next day. It is already evening on the day before. Inside, I'm beginning to panic and wonder how I'm going to be able to get this done. Outside, I'm sure I did a good job of hiding my inner panic and the fact that I had forgotten about it. I don't her to become concerned as to whether I will be able to deliver it on time. Instead of just doing a sketch of her design, she created a model of it. On part of it she had used candy cake decorations. She had quite a few things on it. It was very colorful. She had three things that looked like children's party hats. Each of them had something attached to it that was free flowing. Maybe a flag? I sat it down on the register counter at the store, intending to pick it up on my way out. The cashier said it was fine for me to leave it there and they would keep an eye on it for me. I thought I might be able to buy the cake mixes and icing and such here at this store but they didn't have it. Something happened in the store and people are panicking and frantic and trying to get out of the store. I grab Macy F and the other two women and say, let's get out of here. Fast! We successfully get out without getting hurt or caught. As we started to get in the car I realized that I left the cake top model in the store. I was so mad at myself and I said I just couldn't leave it. I have to get it because I have to get this cake made and delivered. I went back into the store. Whatever was going on is over now. The employees are all very upset. They don't want to let me back in because they are trying to lock up and close the store. I tried to tell them about the cake model that I left on the counter and had to get tonight. I said it is imperative that I get it - now. They finally let me in. We're looking for it and someone said it must have gotten thrown in the trash and then walk away. I'm leaning over the counter on my stomach trying to find a trash can. I finally see one but I see that it has just been emptied as all it has in it is a clean, empty trash bag. I see another one that is further away. I'm practically falling on my head over the counter trying to find these trash cans and see into them. As I start to raise myself up I see two employees on their way outside with two huge trash bags. I stop them and tell them what happened and what I'm looking for. I had to practically beg them to let me look in them. I found it in one of the bags. It was pretty torn up and lots of pieces were missing. I realized that I was going to have to do some of it from memory and just do the best I could. I asked one of the employees about a cake decorating store that I thought was close to their store. I hoped they would know what I was talking about and be able to tell me exactly where it was. She didn't seem to know. I thought it was to the right but set back a bit from their store. I decided I would just have to go drive around and find it on my own. As I got ready to leave the store a young male employee said something to me. He said it isn't really a separate store that I'm looking for. He said that I'm looking for items that they have in their store. He is describing what they have. As he's talking I'm thinking that I did look at what they had but they didn't have what I wanted or needed. I just thanked him and left. Macy F and the other two women went with me to another store. We divided up my shopping list and we each headed to a different part of the store to get what I needed. We meet back at the cash register. As I'm paying for the things I ask them if they wouldn't like to come back to my house and help me. They had both traveled separately to the city where I live so were also traveling separately to go home. They had both made plans to go home tonight. Macy F was going to drive back. I kept trying to convince them, practically begging them. I was telling them how much fun we would have and said there was a grocery store very close to my house where we could stop and get a bottle of wine. They finally agreed to come and help me. We are back at the original store. They are getting all of the stuff together for me to make this cake. They have a very large full sheet cake, rather than the typical 1/4 sheet cake. Though, it seems even larger than that. It is a chocolate cake with chocolate icing. It's a lot higher than most sheet cakes. The icing appears to be very thick and has many decorative peaks in the icing. They just keep bringing out shallow boxes and bags with things in them - all related to this cake I am supposed to make for the next day. The other women and some of the employees are helping me carry all of this stuff to my car. I'm worried about where we are going to put all of it. There are two or three boxes that can't have anything on top of them so I'm concerned about those becoming damaged and getting them home without them getting damaged. There is also a very small cake. It is maybe 6 inches long, 3 inches high, and 3 inches wide. This is supposedly the cake that she really wanted. It has an icing picture of a football field on the top of it. On the way home it breaks in half, so the six inches is now 3 inches each. I'm wondering if the customer is going to be okay with the very large sheet cake and if she's going to be upset because the little one broke in half. I'm also wondering how I'm going to make it work with the chocolate icing on it because she definitely wanted white icing with all of these colorful decorations, and the gridiron. One of the things I was going to the cake-decorating store for was cake decorations. The gridiron on the top of the small cake covered nearly the entire top of the cake. I didn't even remember seeing it on her model. I did remember her talking about what a football fanatic her son is and that there were two teams in particular that he is a fan of. When I was shopping for decorations I was looking for things relative to football, especially these two specific teams. I don't know if I was actually successful finding something I liked. I remember finding something relative to football but I don't remember if I actually bought it or not. On the small cake the gridiron was brown. I had been intending to do it in green because that is the color of an actual gridiron."
"1245"	"(2006-03-19)"	"Darren and I were still married. Someone we knew was going on a trip and they asked him to watch their four cats while they were way. Darren agreed to do this and I was very upset about that because he knows that I am allergic to some cats and very allergic to some. He is, and he had agreed to take care of them in our home while they were away. After a few days, I could hardly take it anymore. I finally told him that he had to do something about this that those cats could not be there anymore. So he decided to kill them. Then he decided that he would only kill two of them. Or at least that's what he told me. He said he was going to keep one of them, because it looked exactly like the owners fifth cat, which we didn't have with us. I don't know why they only gave us for the cats though, to watch while they were gone. We had some friends over for dinner one evening, and as we were having dinner Darren asked us if we were enjoying it, because he had fixed it. Just as he asked as we all happen to be taking a bite of the meat that he had prepared. He asked us if we knew what it was and we all said that we didn't. He then proceeded to tell us that he had killed the third cat and that is what we were eating. We called immediately spit it out on our plate. I felt like I was going to be sick. I simply couldn't believe that he would do that. Everyone seemed horrified that he had done that, or at least that he would cook a cat for people to eat. "
"1246"	"(2006-03-19)"	"I'm standing with a man, and I have a small something in my hand. It is about two or 3 inches long and tubular in shape. There appear to be three sections to it. The sections on each end are the smallest in diameter, and look identical except that one is slightly shorter than the other. The third section, in between these two, is larger in diameter and looks very different. The two smaller ones are maybe an eighth to a quarter inch in diameter, and the larger piece is maybe double that. Part of one end of it is hollow on the inside. We're standing next to something, but I don't know if it's an object or a wall. There is something protruding from this object. The thing that is protruding is also tubular in shape and seems to be almost identical in size as the two smaller ends of the piece that I have in my hand. I am some somehow supposed to fit the piece that I have in my hand onto this protruding piece. The man is telling me that if I line it up just right and get it started that I can tap on the other end, to get it on the rest of the way. I was trying to steady my hand enough to line it up. He reached up and helped me get it lined up. The third larger section now looks very different. This is hard to describe. The entire piece is made of steel. The best way I can describe the larger pieces that it has been slotted every few millimeters creating a tab-like affect all wear around in these tabs flare out a little bit. Though, you can put your fingers around them and push them all in at one time. But you have to hold them there. They won't stay on their own. The piece that I'm trying to fit this on to now is also a slightly different shape. There is a piece that has slots all around the diameter and the tabs of the piece in my hand should fit precisely into the slots. Again, the man made a suggestion on how I could do this in kind of showed me how to do it, telling me that if I did this he would go in fairly easily. To do that I have to hold the tabs in with my fingers and get them lined up just exactly right, because again, they appeared to be nearly identical in size so there isn't much wiggle room."
"1247"	"(2006-03-20)"	"I was checking into a hotel, and I had with me, a small hand-held stereo about the size of Matthew's old boom box. Actually, I think it was Matthew's old boom box. I also had a stack of music CDs. In the lobby of the hotel they had set up a row of six-foot long rectangular meeting tables. There was someone working behind each table. These were somehow related to music. I had gone up to one of the tables thinking that was where I needed to check in. The woman behind the table just pointed me to the registration desk and told me that's where I needed to go. As I walked to the registration desk, I heard that woman say something to the person next to her about the music that I had with me. There was one CD in particular, that, she said, either she's had that music for. They had that music, were they should get that music. I went and checked in. The person at the registration desk pointed to their right and kind of ahead of them and said that was where I needed to go to get to my room. They said I just needed to go over there and follow it around. When I went over there it was a shopping mall. I kept walking, but I was thinking that it just didn't seem right that I had to walk through this would appear to be a very large shopping mall to get to my hotel room. It almost felt as though I had left the hotel, though I realize that the mall and the hotel were attached to each other. So I turned around and backtracked, and I'm when I got to the place where I had started. I saw that there was a narrow, not well lit hallway and was now to my left it would've been to my right before I saw a sign on the wall that had the room numbers with the arrows pointing in the Different directions of the rooms. Even the sign wasn't very noticeable. At least I now realize that this is where I needed to go to get to my room. I hadn't gone very far, and I saw two elevators. I knew I needed to take the elevator to get to my room. The elevators were very, very narrow one of them I would say, was less than or maybe just 12 to 18 inches wide. It seemed to be setting at an angle in the wall to the right of the doorway was kind of curved out this is the one that opened first. The opening was so narrow that even turning sideways I couldn't get in and couldn't even begin to get in. When the doors opened, there was a man standing in there looking at me as though he was waiting for me to get in. I walked up to the door and turned sideways, but didn't even try it because I knew as soon as I did that I wouldn't be able to get in there. I just looked at him and said no sorry, go ahead, I can't get in there or something to that effect. I was embarrassed that I couldn't fit in there, through the opening, but that he obviously had. The inside of the elevators were just deep enough for one person to stand with their back against the back wall. They were wide enough that you could possibly have two people standing in there. Now, both elevators seem to be the same size, though the opening still are not as wide as you would typically see on an elevator, and I would say they were still less than 3 feet wide. They were wide enough that I could get in this time. One of them opens and there is a man inside and he asked me if I want to join him. I hesitated because I didn't think there is room for both of us. He said, oh, and we can both fit in here. So I decided to try it but I turned around and stepped in backwards, so I would have my back against the back wall. Then I would be facing the same way he was. After I got in, he was standing to my right and slightly in front of me. At least his left shoulder was in front of my right shoulder. We were really squashed in there. We were also trying to get my luggage in there as well. Part of his back was definitely pressed up against me. We took a deep breath and inhaled to try to squeeze in even further as the elevator doors closed. The elevator started to go up to my floor. Because I'm claustrophobic, I was trying to think about other things, so I wouldn't feel panicked. I was concentrating, I suppose on trying to stay calm. Still, I was very anxious."
"1248"	"(2006-03-21)"	"It had snowed last night, and the maintenance guys had come and cleared the sidewalks. However, they came so early in the morning like around five or 6 a.m., and it was still snowing. Later, I was going outside and the sidewalks were covered with snow again. I had put on my hiking boots and walked down the front walkway. I was thinking that the neighbor would notice my footprints in the walkway. I have no idea why that would matter. I didn't drive anywhere. I went back to my tool shed and got out my bag of sidewalks all. I was surprised at how little was left in there. There was probably less than 2 cups left. I could get around front, and I started by spreading it across the first step, right outside our doorways, than I moved down to the next step, but didn't even get that whole step done before I ran out. Seems that I may have thought about only using it on half of the sidewalk and go further down, but realize that would be very selfish and rude."
"1249"	"(2006-03-21)"	"I believe that I was living with Mary Kay C and one other woman. Matthew was a young boy 4 1/2 years old. The other woman had a client's coming to the house that day. Mary Kay C and Matthew were both at home. Mary Kay C, the other woman and Matthew were all downstairs, and I was upstairs working in my study. Shortly after the client arrived Matthew came upstairs and stayed with me. After the client left the other woman came upstairs to talk with me. She was very upset with Matthew. When the client had arrived, Matthew went up to her and was talking to her. He was just being friendly. He didn't realize he was doing anything wrong. I'm not even sure he was doing anything wrong. This woman felt that he was being intrusive and bothering her clients. Mary Kay C walked in on our conversation. Fortunately, she defended Matthew. She said something to the effect, to this other woman, what do you really expect from a 4 1/2 year old?"
"1250"	"(2006-03-22)"	"I was at a SAID conference. It was time for me to present. There were people waiting. I went in deciding that I could do this with no problem. I would just do it off-the-cuff but it would still be a quality presentation. I suddenly felt confident that I knew enough to pull it off. I gave the people in attendance a brief explanation of what I was going to be doing. I told them I was going to pose a series of questions and give them time between each question to write down their own responses. At the end, I was going to have each of them share their responses and then I would compare their responses to what I found with the study. I and quite a few other people were in a room that I can best describe as a multipurpose room. The people there that I know are the actor Treat Williams and a few of my high school girlfriends, such as Susan J, Freda L, and Dorothea D. There were a number of meeting tables set up and placed around the room kind of randomly, and there were chairs at the tables. I was feeling fairly anxious because I didn't think that I was well prepared for the presentation that I needed to give. There was something very unusual about the room where I was doing my presentation. There were three of these six-foot long tables set up in a row into and touching each other. At each end there was another table, sitting perpendicular to the row of tables. So a kind of U-shape. There were chairs set up just on the one side of the tables. The outside of the U. and then behind that there was like a wall of white flowy curtains that went from floor to ceiling. They weren't hanging still. It was as though there were air movement in the room that was causing them to kind of flutter. It was a very well lit room. Not a bright light, but a soft, very white light I also seemed to be going in and out of the room during the presentation. There was something about candles or candle flames. I and one other woman were both leaving the multipurpose room at the same time to go for a walk outside. She went out the door first, and I went out, right behind her and she headed off to the right and I headed off to the left. It was a wooded area. It was just coincidental that we were both heading outside to go for a walk at the same time. I had not gone very far and I noticed the music that was playing inside the room. I kept thinking that I wouldn't hear it much longer, as I got further away. It was so loud, and I kept walking, and I still kept hearing it and I finally decided to turn around and go back and turn it down. Because otherwise it was just going to be too annoying and I wouldn't be able to relax and enjoy my walk. I'm surprised that I had turned it up that loud to begin with. It seems that I also had to walk through a wooded area to a clearing, where there was a building that a home. That's where the room was where I was getting my presentation. There are a lot of people in the multipurpose room. By a lot I mean maybe 15 or 20. Several people had just come back from a presentation where they had received an award for some type of quantitative research. We were talking about it and we were all very happy for them. It seems to me that there was a group of us in this room. Maybe all of us in the room were part of a professional group or academic group or social group. We have some kind of connection like that. No. Our connection was research outside of the Association we were talking about the various awards that were presented for research there. I asked someone about awards for qualitative research someone laughed and said, ""You mean like yours?"" I said yes as an example but I don't mean specifically mine. They didn't believe me. I said, I'm just wondering if there is value for our group to pursue awards for different types of research other than just quantitative. They just keep teasing me, and trying to make it all about me wanting an award for my qualitative research. There is a tabletop Christmas tree set up. We all brought presidents and put them on the table under the tree. Susan J had brought in a large gift that I had brought. It was wrapped, but it wasn't in a box. You would almost suspect it to be something like a blanket. It was soft. The gift wrap was torn on one of the large sides. Someone had tried to tape the tear. It was kind of a long tear. Someone had used two or three pieces of tape. The tear was part of what looked to be a piece of a separate wrapping paper. I had folded the edge under and taped the piece on top of the rest of the wrapping paper. I only did it for decoration. Susan J had either written something on the package or said something to someone about me having a romantic interest in Treat. I was so embarrassed by this and thought it was so school girlish. Someone saw something in the wastebasket and they pulled it out and said what is this? Treat and one or two other women walked up to her and were looking at it. As they were talking, I realized what it was. Icon up in Iran over there and took it from her and said, ""Oh that's just some old return address labels of mine."" They gave me a very strange look, because they all said Elizabeth H. So I explained to them, or I just briefly said well, I changed my name. I really didn't want to go in to it with them why I changed my name, and why those labels even had a different first name. I didn't see any more, and I just put them back in the trashcan. They all still had very often looks on their faces. There was some place that a number of us needed to go, and we needed to go by car. We were trying to decide if we could all fit in one car. I mention that my girlfriends had a car, and if any of them were going that would solve the problem. We could just divide up between the two cars. I walked up to Susan J or one of the others and asked them if they were going so we can make plans accordingly. It seems as though this multipurpose room was all so, the area where we were doing dressed or ready for wherever else we were going. We were using this space to do individual preparation for presentations, but we were also using it for grooming. It seems to me that Treat knew that I had some level of personal interest in him. It didn't seem to bother him. However, he also didn't do or say anything to encourage it, reciprocate, or to indicate any mutual feelings. There was certainly nothing uncomfortable or awkward about it, or about the way he interacted with me, even though he knew that. It was more a feeling of warmth or fondness. Some of the other people there felt that it was inappropriate for me to have those feelings. Even though I wasn't acting on those feelings. I have no idea why it would be inappropriate, or why someone might think it was inappropriate. I was returning to the room from walking somewhere outside. When I got to the door I had my key in my hand, but he was standing there also getting ready to put his key in the door. We chatted casually and briefly about something related to the door being locked, or the keys."
"1251"	"(2006-03-24)"	"My entire family was embarking on a trip together. My parents, my siblings, and all of their children were all going along. They seemed to be in clusters in various places around the airport as we were waiting for our flight. However, I was alone. Jason S was in a handicapped stall and the restroom and he had Kaitlyn S and another small child with him. I was listening and observing, yet I wasn't in the restroom. He was either explaining something to them or explaining to them that they had to wait until they were finished there. I don't recall now. I was visiting several of the shops in the airport looking for watch batteries. I was looking for two different sizes. I finally found them and bought them. I went up an escalator. I think that's where I needed to go to catch our flight. Just at the top of the escalator, there was a service desk. It was very awkward because it was just a few feet from where you step off of the escalator. This was especially bothersome to me since escalators make me nervous anyway. There was also a cash register at the service desk. I had gone to sit down and realize that one of the watch batteries. I had been sold was not the size that I was looking for. They had given me the wrong one. I took it to the service desk to see if I could return it there and get my money back. She said that I could. Oddly, however, I was concerned as to whether or not I have enough cash, and I looked in my wallet and saw that I had two dollars. I knew that would be enough. I then went to the restroom. I was in one of the stalls, and I was either sitting on a chair next to the toilet. Maybe I was sitting on the floor by the toilet. I had put my purse, on top of the toilet and had my arms crossed on top of it resting my head on my arms and napping. I don't remember what caused me to wake up. When I awoke, however, I was slightly groggy, but I got up, left the restroom, and went back to find my family. I passed one of the members of my family in one of the walkways, and they told me where different groups of the family were gathered. There is a group at the gate. There is a group in a restaurant. I decided to go to the gate. Bill F is standing there talking to daddy, who is sitting in one of the chairs. Bill F is standing next to a beverage cooler that is approximately 4 feet tall and may be 2 1/2 to 3 feet in diameter. It's the kind of cooler that you might see at an athletic event for the players except that I have never seen one this large. Those are also usually orange or yellow in color. This one is what I would describe as a frosty white color. I think the lid was red. See through it, just enough to realize that the beverage inside was red. Bill F was trying to explain to daddy that they were treating it as a carry on. They weren't going to check it. I was listening and not understanding what was going on. Daddy said something about it being sealed tightly enough with Bill F said it needed air. It was then that I discovered that Brian F was inside this container. I was furious. I couldn't believe they were trying to sneak him on the plane without having to pay for him. That he didn't seem all that bothered by it. I kept saying it is illegal. It's not right. I finally got so upset I just turned and walked away."
"1252"	"(2006-03-26)"	"I was in the hospital as a patient but I don't know why. While I was there I started having pains in my upper left arm and something else. They decided they needed to keep me and run some tests. One of the doctors wanted to test me for sleep apnea and I told me no because I've already been tested for that and narcolepsy. Both were ruled out. When I first went to the hospital it wasn't for anything serious. I don't even know that they were going to keep me overnight. I didn't even let Matthew interrupt his work schedule to be there with me. Then they became concerned and were going to keep me for a couple of days. I became anxious and told them I wanted them to call Matthew. I wanted him there now. He was surprised to get the call saying that it had become much more serious than we had originally thought. He got there very quickly and stayed the entire time. They did end up keeping for a couple of days. When they got ready to release me I had to take a shower first because I had some substance, have no idea what, all over me. It was in my hair, all over my face, arms, and torso. I was wearing one of my SAID shirts and it was covered. They took me into a large shower room. It reminds of the showers in a high school, where it's one large open space but has a lot of showerheads on the wall. Only this one only had one showerhead. There was a very simple small square table standing along one wall. The top was about a 12-inch square. I had some of my things setting on top of it. As I removed my clothing I folded it and placed it on there as well. One of the nurses started the water. I was pulling off this nasty t-shirt. I realized that where the table was sitting my things would get wet. I moved the table so they wouldn't get wet. There was a nurse in there helping me. She was a very small woman. Much younger than I, shorter, and much thinner. She had very long, black, straight hair. She took all of her clothes off also because she didn't want them to get wet while she was helping me. This made me uncomfortable but I was trying to be okay with it because I knew she was just trying to help me. There was so much of this stuff caked in my hair and she was helping me with shampoo and trying to get it out."
"1253"	"(2006-03-27)"	"Jody S, Kaitlyn S, BJ, and Kim H were at my house helping me with something. We were talking about my new car. They wanted to go out and look at it. As we walked out, I handed the keys to Jody S so she could sit in the driver's seat. As I did, I accidentally hit the remote trunk button. I also pushed the unlock button. Just as I did, I realized that Jody S knows how to use these remotes and I hoped I hadn't upset her by doing that. There was someone else with us also. That person got in the passenger side of the front seat and I got in the back seat behind her. BJ got in the other side of the backside but slid over to the middle to make room for Kim H. Kim H had gotten to the car before Jody S so she got in the driver's seat, leaving Jody S to get in the back behind her. Kaitlyn S was sitting in the middle of the front seat, and with no car seat. Jody S is now in the driver's seat, starts up the car, and begins to back out of the parking space. I was surprised because I didn't think we were going anywhere. She asks where we want to go. I'm concerned because Kaitlyn S isn't in her car seat so I say let's just drive around the neighborhood. She didn't do that though. After a little bit she says, ""Okay. Let's pull it up."" She pulls back the steering wheel like you would in an airplane and the car lifts off the ground. I said didn't know this car could do this and she said that most cars can, but people just don't know it. We stopped someplace. I'm standing outside the car. The right side, rear passenger door is open and I'm standing to the outside of it. A tall man walks up. He has blonde hair with medium build. He appears to be about my age or just a little older. He is attractive. My trunk is open as is one or two of the other car doors. He walks up to the other side of my car, opens the door, and puts something in it. It's as though he had just come from a store and he put his purchase in the back seat before getting in to drive away. He looks at me and smiles. I must have had a puzzled look on my face because I was wondering who he was and why he was putting something in my car. He chuckled and said something about me not remembering him. He was teasing me about it. I do recognize him but I was so caught off guard by seeing him there and then having him put something in my car that I don't say anything at all right away. He turns toward the rear of my car. As he begins to walk away, he says his name and where we met, still thinking that I didn't remember him, smiling the whole time. He walks across the back of the car and crosses a driveway, stepping onto a sidewalk. I ran after him and said, ""Andre, Andre. I do remember you. I'm smiling as I say this."" I handed him my house key. At first he looks surprised but then he gives me a big smile. As he wraps his fingers around the key, he has this very mischievous look on his face. He turns and walks away. I had given him my key as an indication that I would be interested in seeing him again. As I walked back to the car I was thinking how ridiculous it was for me to do that - to give him my house key. It occurs to me that he doesn't know my address and since he doesn't know my last name he has know way to find me. I relax, thinking that it will be okay that I did it. Still, I couldn't stop thinking about it and later realized that he did know my last name. He could easily look up my address and find me. We are at my birth home for a family event. Andre pulls up with one or more of my CRHP sisters. I am so surprised to see him, and especially to see him with them. I found out that one of my CRHP sisters invited him here. I'm furious. I wasn't expecting him and I feel like I look a mess. I hadn't spent any time on doing my hair that morning. I didn't have any make-up on and I had on old clothes. He sees me from a distance, as he is getting out of the car. Before he has a chance to get any closer I run into my bedroom and lock the door. I'm aggravated. I don't really want to do my hair and makeup. I'm changing clothes, trying to find something to wear that I like and feel good in. I bet I changed at least a dozen times. Each item I took off I would just toss onto the bed. There ended up being quite a pile of clothes there. Some things I just didn't like the way the looked. Other things were too tight and that made me frustrated and upset. I was thinking about the fact that I had been working so hard on weight loss over the last three weeks. I suddenly realized that I had been in there for quite some time. I can hear all of them in the kitchen having a meal. They are talking and laughing. Andre is just being the life of the party. He is the center of attention and talking to everyone. You would think he has known all of these people forever. I don't know what to make of all of this. Someone says something to him about not dating me. He says he doesn't have a choice. He has to. He explains what he means but I can't remember the words he used. What he was implying is that he was somewhat like an indentured servant to me now so he must be with me. He said it as though he was glad to have a reason to keep seeing me that they couldn't argue with. He ends up leaving before I go back out there. I go back to the kitchen. My CRHP sisters know how angry I am at this point. They're explaining to me that they did this because they really care about me. They know that I have a tendency to attract men who aren't healthy for me. They hoped if they brought him here everyone would get to know him for who he really is and he would start feeling uncomfortable and decide to stay away from me. They don't want to see me in another bad relationship. Andre has qualities similar to some of the other bad choices I have made in the past. They point out some of those common characteristics that make it quite evident that they are not a good choice for me. We are still standing in the kitchen but now it is just the women in my family who are there. They are continuing to talk about this but I'm not saying anything. Someone changes the topic. We're getting ready to have a meal. My sisters and mother have prepared some special dishes for a special occasion that we are celebrating today. One of them is some kind of egg casserole. It is made in a pie plate, but it's not a quiche. The top is high and very decorative. There is also something that is in a bowl. It is a baked dish made with sliced apples and strips of dough, kind of like a pie but it isn't. It looks very different than a pie would. Someone said we need to take all three of these out of the dishes they are in know and put them on serving platters to take them to the table. I pick up the apple dish. They told me if I run a spatula around the edges and under the bottom it should slide right out. As I begin to try to do that I see that it is very liquid and not holding it's shape at all. I'm showing them and telling them what's happening. They are discussing why it's like this and what to do about it. "
"1254"	"(2006-03-31)"	"I had gone to a meeting at SMW, I believe it was. I think there was a board meeting going on, though I don't think I was actually on the board. I had been asked to serve on the board. They were meeting outside. The meeting area was on two different levels. One level was shaped like a rectangle and the higher level was shaped like a circle. Members of the board were sitting along the long end of the rectangle and along the corresponding sides of the circle. I was there doing something for the school. It involved. It involved something that was in this circular area where the board was meeting. I had to go up to that area several times, kind of going in and out as they were meeting. I don't know if the meeting was actually in session or not, or perhaps it was just a very casual meeting. Several times, as I went in and out of the area, various people said things to me. One time it was a woman. Another time it was a man who was not quite 6 feet tall, with a medium build. There was another man who spoke to me a couple of times, who reminds me very much of Dan M. They were both warm and friendly towards me, but the one who reminds me of Dan M was probably a little more so. The last time I went into this area, this man asked me something about where I was going or how I was getting there are all made some comment about that. As I was motioning, I said while to walk back to your then back out there and then down there. It seems to me that there was a main road entering the campus and than a, not really a side road, but a side path that led to this area where they were having the meeting. That's what I was referring to when I answered him. He suggested that I let him drive me rather than me walking the entire distance. I don't think I even hesitated before saying, OK. Earlier, the other man had said something the other woman about wanting to go out with me. Then they both chuckled. I don't remember now exactly what he said, but it gave me the impression that he really only wanted to go out to be intimate. Since he gave me that impression, I really had no desire to go out with him. So I didn't do or say anything to encourage him to ask me out. I don't know how I knew this but I knew that the other man was gay. Maybe that's why I didn't even hesitate to let him drive me. With him being gay, I didn't have to worry about him wanting to be intimate with me. After her that he and I became pretty close and did a lot of things together. One time, we were doing something. He was sitting at a table, and I was standing behind him. I leaned over and my arms around him, and kind of rested my head on his shoulder, as we were talking and laughing. I was thinking about how great it felt to be so comfortable with someone, and to get along so well. I was back at the school with all the same people. The other man said something to that other woman about me not going out with him. The woman said something to me, it almost sounded like she was scolding me, or accusing me of being rude for not going out with him. They both wanted to know why I wouldn't go out with him. I told them it was because of the comment he made that led me to believe that he wanted physical intimacy on a date. That may not have been the only reason why he wanted to go out. His comment did lead me to believe that he certainly did want that. Spending time with this other man was very safe."
"1255"	"(2006-03-31)"	"I was with a group of people, I think there were just four of us, who were working together on an ad layout. Three of the people in the group had different types of psychology ads. They were each for very different services. You would typically not see them advertised together in a publication because of their differences. However, the four of us saw a definite benefit to placing all of the ads together. It was not that we were placing them next to each other on the same page. We were incorporating them all into one ad. We felt they would each get more results from the ad, because we had done it this way. A man came up and told us that we shouldn't be doing it this way. He had some type of supervisory role over us. The rest of us immediately started trying to explain to him why we're doing it the way we were and why we believed it was the best thing to do, or the smartest thing to do. We felt this was going to be best for everyone, that everyone would benefit more by doing it this way than if we did it the traditional way."

Jo V was there of course. I spoke with Jan F a little, but mostly with Jo V. I am back at the house. Deven D came with me to spend some time talking about my dissertation. He kept telling me how much better it is and that he thinks it is really good. We had been in the living room talking. He went upstairs to use the bathroom up there. As he was coming back down he turned and looked at me and began talking about the dissertation again. I was thinking about how different he looked, maybe because it was so odd to see him in my home. He was wearing Khaki pants and a button-down shirt. One of his front shirttails was hanging out of his pants. It was time for him to go and continued to try to reassure me about the dissertation, then gave me a warm hug before he left. "
"1258"	"(2006-04-02)"	"A bunch of extended family members were helping Aunt J move. The only ones I can identify, however, are Bruce W and at least two of his children. I know there others. Some of my siblings were there and my parents. We were outside of the front of the building. I don't know if it was a home or a condo. It doesn't seem to be an apartment. She had a large area in front that I would describe as a courtyard. There was a fence around it with an entry gate. Three of the corners, the two nearest the building and the one to the front, right as you face the building had square, concrete areas. On the one to the right and closest to the house she had placed some outdoor items like furniture, a flower pot, and a trellis. The trellis was about two feet high and four feet long. It had a green, flowering vine growing on it, yet it wasn't growing out of the ground or a flower pot. Some of what was there was a plastic chair and table for a child and at least one plastic chair for an adult. I think the flower pot was filled with dirt but didn't have a flower or plant in it. Aunt J had placed the things there haphazardly. The way they were placed there no one could sit in the chairs. The trellis seemed to be falling over. So I started moving things around, placing the trellis and then placing the furniture so the chairs could be used. My doing this prompted Bruce W to bring out other chairs of this same type. As he was doing that I was placing them on these three different squares of concrete, in a way that they would look nice. Some of the things that he brought out were in two pieces and needed to be snapped together. When I looked at some of them I didn't know what they were until he put one together. There were piles of each piece. I think some of the others started helping. I just kept going from square to square, placing them to try to make it look nice. He brought out so many of them that I didn't know what to do with all of them. I didn't know what I was going to be able to do with all of them and still make it look nice. Aunt J was sitting out there, just watching them. She was always the type to not let anything bother her, so she didn't really care how it looked yet she appreciated what we were doing and that we were making it look a little nicer. Later, I decided that I needed to call and talk to Bruce W. I was hesitant because I had never called him before or even having a conversation with him as an adult. I was also concerned about his wife answering the phone because that would make me even more uncomfortable. I finally went ahead and called and his wife did answer. I asked him for him and he wasn't there. She asked if she could help me. I told her no and that I just felt that I really needed to talk to him. "
"1259"	"(2006-04-02)"	"An event with an odd mix of people. Reid W was there and Todd A was there as well as others that would be associated with either of them. I was one of the hosts of this event. The event was over and there were quite a few of us helping to clean up. We had a lot of food there and there was a lot left. I asked someone what we should do with it. Reid W said that he was supposed to take the Prime Rib home and that we should just throw the rest away. There was alot of food left so I was really bothered by this. It wasn't just alot of variety left but many of the bowls and platters still had alot in or on them. I didn't want to just throw it away. I think I wanted to take it home but I was embarrassed to say I wanted to take it home. I don't think anyone would think anything of someone suggesting that the Prime Rib be taken home by someone. But I was concerned that someone would look down at me if I said I wanted to take any of the other stuff home. It was stuff like vegetable platters, cheese platters, potato salad, Jell-O salad. I was thinking that I would really appreciate having that food. Since I am unemployed and have no income I've been very stingy with my grocery budget and I'm getting very tired of eating the same old, inexpensive things like pasta, soup, and peanut butter. The tables had been set up in a U-shape. As we were talking Reid W was walking along the tables on the inside of the U. He was putting both of his hands into some of the food. There was a Jell-O salad with whipped cream on top and he actually put both of his hands down in it and moved them around it. As he did this he said, ""See. There's no need to save this."" I was thinking that it was perfectly fine to be saved until he put his hands in it like that. He did the same thing with some potato salad and some other things. Part of me still wanted to take them home even though he had done that. There was a vegetable platter that had alot of olives and pickles on it. I was thinking how much I would like to have the olives, though I knew they weren't good for me because they are so high in sodium, and I'd been doing so well watching what I eat and losing weight. Still, it had been so long since I had olives. I had been so careful with my food budget lately that I was trying to justify the olives to myself by saying that it was free food. It occurred to me that Todd A would be arriving soon and I was sure he would agree with me and that he wouldn't mind at all speaking up and telling them that we shouldn't throw the food away. I thought if I asked him to do this that maybe he and I could split it. Since he is a college freshman I was sure he would appreciate saving some grocery money as well. He showed up and overheard our conversation. He immediately agreed with me that we shouldn't just throw it all away. He said he would be happy to have some of it. I don't know that he realized yet that I wanted some of it. One thing that was there was a large platter of small sandwiches. The sandwiches were hotdogs and sausages wrapped in bread but cut in half. They were piled high on the platter. He picked one up and began eating it. I picked one up as well, but I tore alot of the excess bread around the crust off first to save myself some fat and calories. A few minutes later he and I both went back and got another. The first one I had was a hot dog and the second a sausage."
"1260"	"(2006-04-05)"	"My family was helping Brian F and someone else move and then they helped me move. Or I might have been living with Brian F and they were helping us both move but into separate homes. I was moving into a condo on the right side of North Point Bay. When we were at Brian F's there were boxes piled chest-high everywhere. There was little room to walk. I was helping to sort them by who they belonged to. I was standing outside of where I live now, a little distance away, looking at the front of the building. It looked very different than in waking life. It reminds me more of the way some condos are laid out, with individual driveways and six or more steps leading up to the front door. I was thinking about some of the neighbors and that it was kind of sad that I had lived here for so long but I didn't know anyone well enough for them to be sad that I was moving, or even realize that I had moved."

"1262"	"(2006-04-07)"	"I had gone in to work for CAS. Instead of just letting me go completely, Bill C reduced my work hours drastically. He would just have me come in a few hours a week or on a project basis. I had gone in when he requested me to. I'm sitting at a very large table, kind of like a conference table. There is stuff piled everywhere. I'm sitting there sifting through things, wondering why I'm even there. Someone comes in and picks up some very large pieces of paper that look like bluelines. Just seeing those makes me feel upset. I start thinking about Bryan N and become intensely more angry. (I woke up feeling so angry and irritable). Bill C came in and sat down in a chair, kind of behind me and to my left, but facing me. He crossed his legs at the knees, and was sitting there with one hand on his knees and smiling at me. I turned halfway around to my left to face him. I asked him why he even has me keep coming back in. His expression didn't change at all. He just sat there smiling at me and didn't answer me. It suddenly occurred to me that I am no longer eligible for unemployment, so there was no reason for me to stay. I told him that I was not coming back anymore. I was dressed in all black. I have on a skirt with something down the front of it that resembled a ruffle. It had a slight slit in the front as well. As I was sitting facing Bill C, I had my legs crossed at the knees and my hand lying at the hem of my skirt right were the slit was. I was at home in bed, and it was dark. I was lying on my left side with my back to the door. I don't think I was fully asleep. I thought someone had come in the bedroom door, but I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or someone really had come in. So I just lay there very still and kept listening and waiting to see if I heard anything else or if anything else happened. It felt like someone was getting into bed behind me. I was very scared and didn't know if I should turn over on my back to see if someone was really there or not. I thought that if I had been dreaming when I turned over to my back, I would see that no one was there and then I would be able to relax. The first time or two that I tried, I couldn't move. The third time, just as I started to move I saw an arm come over me. It pulled back just as I began to move, so I quickly turned back to my left side. After I did this, the arm came back around me and took me into an embrace. I realized that it was Bill C. I seemed to be feeling a lot of different emotions at once. I was feeling anger, compassion, warmth, caring, understanding, and dislike all at once. I put my right hand on his arm as I turned slightly onto my back, just enough so I could turn my head and see him. He had propped himself on his side, resting on his left elbow. So as I turned I found myself facing him directly with our faces just inches apart. I think I was the first one to speak, but I don't know what I said. As I spoke, I moved my right hand and gently placed it on his left cheek. I raised my left hand and placed it lightly behind his head and rested partially on his hair and partially on his bare neck. I don't know who initiated it, but we kissed gently. He began to kiss me more, with more feeling, though I can't say that it was passionate. I realize that he had removed all of his clothes before he climbed into bed. Because I had gone to bed with nothing on, I was now feeling very vulnerable. Just then, I heard someone come in downstairs. There had been someone else down there, who was supposed to be there and who was still awake. It was Jane C who had just come in. She headed directly for the staircase leading to the bedroom. The other person tried to stop her, knowing that Bill C was up there with me. Jane C just dismissed this person and kept walking toward the staircase. The bedroom was an open loft, so Bill C and I could both see her. It was a very large area, and the staircase was along the right wall, and it was an arc shape. Bill C jumped up and I pointed behind the bed where there was room for him to crouch down so Jane C wouldn't see him. At the same time, I jumped up and grabbed my robe and was putting it on as I headed towards the staircase. I had hoped to get to the bottom of the steps before she started up so I could stop her. She was already three quarters of the way up the steps by the time I got to the top of the staircase. I just stopped and waited. Bill C had not fully gotten behind the bed yet. She told him not to bother trying to hide. I started apologizing profusely. I wanted to tell her that I had not invited him there. Before I had a chance to say anything she placed her hands on my face and smiled and said, ""It's okay. It's okay. I don't mind."" She proceeded to tell me that she is gay. Her and Bill C were staying married for Kara C's sake, but they had agreed to see other people so they could each satisfy their needs for an emotionally or physically intimate romantic relationship. Even so, I don't know that I want to be in relationship with Bill C. I haven't liked him lately and have not wanted anything to do with him. I thought I would be happy to never see him again. I am lying in bed, still with no clothes on, but covered with my flannel sheet. One of their mother's is lying in bed with me, to my left. She is a short woman with short black hair and somewhat Asian in appearance. She is very upset by all of this and talking to me about it, though I don't get the feeling that she is particularly upset with me, or blaming me. I am feeling very awkward, especially because she is in bed with me and I don't have any clothes on. Then Jane C gets into bed also, to my right. The three of us are now lying there discussing this. Jane C makes the mother feel okay about it all and we end up chatting and joking a bit. She turns to her right side and falls asleep. She has both of my bed pillows under her head, with her right arm under them. I don't know why but I feel the need to comfort her so I turn onto my right side and begin to slide my right arm under her head. As I do this I think that maybe I could gently roll her onto her back and could then get one of the pillows for under my own head. As I try to roll her onto her back and reach with my left hand for one of the pillows she begins to wake up. I quickly lower my left hand onto her left arm. She thinks I am making an advance towards her and makes it clear that she is not interested. I wasn't going to tell her that I really just wanted a pillow. I am at a public facility something like a YMCA. I am very upset and angry about everything that has happened, from ending my job with Bill C to everything that happened in the bedroom. I want to find a way to physically work off the negative emotions. Someone I know well, a friend, is the manager of this facility. It almost seems as though it might be Bonnie K. We're talking about what's going on at the facility. There are a lot of people there. She is telling me what the various people are doing. I decide the best way for me to feel better is to work so I ask how I can help. I'm walking around the women's locker room looking at what is available there. There are quite a few individual stalls that appear to be athletic-type soaking tubs. The deep stainless-steel type with some kind of whirlpool equipment attached to the outside. However, it also had something that resembled shower hardware attached to the wall. Because of the way they were built and the things that I saw in each one, I wasn't sure what they were. Two young girls walked by and I heard them talking and giggling about them being both tubs and steam rooms. They were mocking women who use them. There seemed to be quite a few women in the locker room. It was divided by walls into different areas. The showers were in a separate area from these tubs. As I was walking around this area I was thinking how long it had been since I had used a steam room and sauna and how great it would feel. It would also feel great to use a whirlpool or to be able to take a bubble bath in a large, deep bathtub. Bonnie K is working behind a high counter, like you might see at a doctor's office. The public area on the other side is long, but fairly narrow, more like a hallway than a room or reception area. The counter and wall that it runs along has an arc shape. "
"1263"	"(2006-04-09)"	"I was at a SAID conference in a hotel. I had checked in but was working on something in the registration area. Attendees began to arrive and I realized that I had less than an hour to get ready for something else I was scheduled to do, attend a meeting or make a presentation or some such. I quickly left and took an elevator upstairs to my room. As I hurried towards my room I realized that I had left my room key downstairs at the registration area and had to go back down to get it. I was feeling very frantic but the other people down there were trying to reassure me that I had plenty of time. I did not see how that was possible as I had not even showered yet. I didn't want people arriving and seeing me before I had a chance to shower and dress better. There was something physically wrong with me so I had to see a doctor. I saw one doctor but then decided I wanted to see Doctor Pf, who was there. He asked me to explain my symptoms. One of the symptoms was a feeling of pins and needles in my hands. "
"1264"	"(2006-04-11)"	"I had stopped by Judy D's house hoping that I could spend the night because it was very late and I felt that I was too exhausted to make it the rest of the way home that night. I was sitting next to Judy D watching TV with her and her husband. She was to my left. At some point I had turned my back to her and had nearly fallen asleep. I had the feeling that she didn't really want me to spend the night. When she thought I might be falling asleep she started saying my name and I just pretended to be asleep. She moved away from me very slowly so as not to wake me up. It seems that she had decided she would be okay with me staying there as long as I was only sleeping on the sofa. Now Suzanne B and one of our other CRHP sisters are there. We were chatting and tending to two infants. I was holding one of them on its stomach while rocking her. The women were looking at me kind of odd and I asked them why. They did not think what I was doing was good for the baby and they didn't think the baby like it at all. I thought about defending myself and telling them that I've known babies to find this very comforting and that it can help them to go to sleep. I decided against it and just handed the baby to one of the other women. I said something to the effect that it looked like no one else was going to show up. I was really tired and really just wanted to sleep but knew that would be rude with the other two women there so I told them that I was going to head home. One of them protested ever so slightly but I said I would be fine. I went outside to get on my bike. My bike looked like a section of split rail fence. It had a post on either end and three connecting rails, one at the bottom, one at the top, and one in the middle. There was no seat, no handlebars, no wheels, and no pedals. I don't know what actually propelled it forward, but when I first started out I was having trouble getting it to move. Because it was so late, it was quite dark outside. I felt a little anxious about this but quickly dismissed it. As I was riding home my bike started talking to me. It was affirming all of the things that I had done ""right"" that day. I wasn't buying all of it, but nonetheless found it a little comforting. I'm not sure why, but I got lost going home. I came to a housing subdivision. I thought I knew a way through this subdivision to get home. I rode through a section that reminded me of the inside of a home. I was getting so tired. I saw something that reminds me of a bus shelter. The weather wasn't that bad, chilly but not freezing cold and no precipitation, so I decided that I would just go in there and sleep for a few hours before going the rest of the way home. I was just settling onto the floor when a woman approached me looking both scared and angry. As she got closer she asked me what I was doing. I told her. She started yelling at me that I was in her home. I quickly realized that I had ridden my bike through her house. I apologized profusely. As I got on my bike I asked her if she could give me directions. I explained where I lived and what the buildings looked like. They looked like the condos on the right side of North Point Bay, with brown, rustic-looking siding. She was pointing as she gave me directions. As she pointed I saw a huge waterfall that reminds me of Niagara Falls. I realized that if I had continued riding in the dark earlier I would have gone right into the waterfall as I didn't know it was there and it was very close to the street that I needed to take to get home. I was thinking how lucky I was that I stopped here. The woman seemed to not be angry with me any longer. I got on my bike and headed home."

"1266"	"(2006-04-13)"	"I was married to Dennis Quaid. Something had happened that had caused major damage to the building we were in. Dennis had been injured and was unable to walk out by himself. I kept telling him to just lie against my back and I would drag him out. He kept saying no, thinking I couldn't or that it would hurt me. He finally gave in. There was rubble everywhere. I was stepping over rubble in a doorway in my effort to get us out."
"1267"	"(2006-04-15)"	"Bill C asked me to go somewhere with him related to his business. We were in his car and talking as he drove. He pulled up to a stoplight. He continued talking as we waited for the light to change. He turned and looked at me and then paused, tilted his head down, closed his eyes and then dropped his head back against the headrest. At first, I thought he was just pausing to think before he continued. Then I realized that something was wrong, that he had passed out. The light changed so I crossed my leg over and pushed his leg out of the way and off of the brake. I took the steering wheel as I put my foot on the gas and steered the car off to a gas station. I pulled up right next to the front of the building, with the driver's side of the car next to the building. I rolled down the driver's side window. Through the window, I saw two employees. I was yelling ""call 911,"" ""call 911."" As I did this he came to, so I told the employees never mind. "
"1268"	"(2006-04-18)"	"There was a man whose job it was to transport very important confidential documents. They were secured in a locked briefcase that was secured to his wrist by a chain. It seems that I was watching and discussing this with someone while he was getting ready to board a plane to deliver some documents. What I can't figure out is where we were standing while we were watching this. I know we were standing someplace that was higher than the top of the plane because we were kind of looking down. But I have no sense of being inside a building and looking through a window. The front of the plane opened up similar to the way the hood of a car would open to access the engine. The man walked up and with one hand lifted the hood of the plane, lifting from the part closest to the windshield. But there was no engine in there. Instead, it was just a large open area where he was going to sit during the flight. When this was open, for lack of a better description, it looked like he was sitting in a sunroom. Surrounded by large panes of glass with something dividing each pane. I don't know how this would be possible because before he lifted the hood that part of the plane looked like any other airplane. He sat down, pulled the hood down, and closed it. That way he and the documents would be unseen and more secure. While the plane was airborne, the man was going to a compartment at the back of the plane. I have no idea why. He couldn't do this by going through the inside of the plane though. He lifted the hood of the front compartment where he had been sitting and climbed out. Along the outside of the plane there was a running board like you would see on a truck. It went the full length of the plane. So this man faced the plane standing on his running board and made his way to the back compartment walking sideways. It seems that he was placing his hands against the plane while he was doing this to he was keeping his hands flat against the plane to help steady himself and keep his balance, but there wasn't anything for him to grab onto. It looked like any other passenger airline from the outside because if he was making his way back he was passing all of the windows. When he got to the back of the plane he opened another hood or hatch. This compartment looked more like the baggage compartment of a regular passenger airline."
"1269"	"(2006-04-19)"	"I was a member of a team of professional organizers. We had gone to someone's home to help them clean up a few rooms and get organized. The only room I remember us doing in the dream though is the kitchen. The home belonged to a couple that I would guess to be in their early 30s. Initially the husband was not at all supportive of the wife's desire to do this project. They had two children that I think were both boys. They were all helping with this clean up and we had the boys carrying things to other rooms or taking things out to the trash. We had gotten about halfway finished when the woman had to leave. I don't know why she had to leave. The husband reluctantly got more involved and as he did his attitude became very positive. There was either a doormat just outside the front door or a rug just inside it. It was in really bad shape so the team was going to throw it away. The man really fought us on it initially. I don't know why he was so attached to it. We did finally let him talk us into replacing it. Once we got most of the mess out of the kitchen we realized that their appliances were in very bad condition so we wanted to replace all of them. The husband was excited about this because he knew it would make his wife very happy. There was now an extraordinarily large black man in the kitchen. He was probably 7 feet tall with a very large body build. There was also a very small black man there. I don't think he was much more than 3 feet tall. Even though he was very short, I know that it was an adult male. The larger man was harassing or threatening the smaller man. I was standing to the left along side the small man I was telling the large man that his words and behaviors were inappropriate. As I told them that I reached take the hand of the small man. As I did so the small man reached up to take my hand. We interlocked our fingers in a very unusual way. We had all of our fingers closed and it's completely at the knuckle. We interlocked our fingers this way from the ends of our fingers. I don't know how to better describe that. As soon as our fingers interlocked I turned to leave the house guiding the small man to walk with me. The look on the large man's face told me that he didn't realize he was being inappropriate. He looks more regretful or sad then upset or angry."
"1270"	"(2006-04-22)"	"This was about little people. It seemed to go on a long time. I woke from it a few times."
"1271"	"(2006-04-23)"	"A lot of it was very unusual. It seemed that for most of the dream things were in a constant state of metamorphosis. I was aware of this in the dream though I had no thoughts about it being a dream or about being lucid. I was walking inside a building. The walls just ahead of me to my left continued to change as I walked forward. I know I had some kind of thought about how this would impact where I was headed as I was walking but that's all I can remember. There were a lot of very unusual images. There were two men in this dream that were executives for a company. The name of one of them was Tom Mossman. The other one I only know his last name and it was Merriman. Their company was going to be donating products for something that I was involved in. I don't know that I ever actually saw or met Mr. Merriman. I saw Tom a few times. One of those times he expressed an interest in going out with me. I don't think I gave him an answer and I think there were probably a couple of reasons why I didn't. The main one is it didn't seem appropriate given our professional relationship. I think part of it was also because I don't know what I want right now in terms of relationship with a man and I didn't know if he would want to go out if it was always just going to be casual dating. I went to their facility to look at the things that they were going to donate. They had large quantities of each item and they were all sitting in a large room. It didn't really look like a factory or a warehouse or anything like that. The things were all set up in rows with aisles between them. I was walking up and down the aisles looking at the various things. At first I was concerned because the items looked very worn, for lack of a better word. Some of the colors on some of them were faded or chipped. It looked like they were used. I didn't feel it was appropriate to give away items that look like this at the event I was involved in. It seems to me that there were two employees in this room as I was walking around and that may be someone involved in what I was working on had joined me while I was there. Someone reassured me that the items that we would be getting were all in very good condition and looked fine. They pointed to some items in the room as an example and so I felt a little less concerned. Tom approached me again. He was being very charming. He said something to me about once our transaction was over we wouldn't be in a business relationship anymore so then we could go out. He also said something to imply that he was quite confident that he would change my mind and get me to go out with him."
"1272"	"(2006-04-24)"	"I was sending and responding to emails related to the SAID conference. I know at least some of them were from Cedric H. On some of them I thought they could wait. There was a reason that I didn't want to respond to them right away but I don't remember what it was."
"1273"	"(2006-04-25)"	"I went to Marsh to pick up a few groceries. They had pumpkins everywhere inside the store and every place they could put them outside the store. They made it difficult to get around. I thought about whether or not to buy one but didn't think I would use it, yet I bought one anyway. Some of them were huge, like as much as 3 feet in diameter. When I went outside I had to walk up a circular ramp to get to my car. The ramp had no walls or safety barriers on either side and no sidewalk so I was just walking up the middle. I think this ramp was only for pedestrian traffic. I was having trouble pushing the shopping cart up this ramp. There was an employee standing nearby. I have the sense that she was directing cars. I told her that it looked like it would be easier for me to pull the cart up the ramp rather than trying to push it. As I went to the other side of it to begin pulling it up another woman walked up and pushed while I pulled. I noticed how easy this was working as we were going up pretty quickly. I realized the other woman was doing most of the work. I had a conversation with an attractive young man, in his late 20's or early 30's. He wasn't much taller than me, with black hair and an athletic build. He was dressed in business clothes. He was flirting and wanted to go out. I kind of laughed it off, not taking him seriously because of his age. Because I didn't think he was serious, I jokingly flirted back. It became clear to me that he was serious. As I put my groceries in my car, he asked me if I would call him. I didn't really say yes or no. It feels like I was looking down at him, as though the ground he was standing on was a significantly lower level than where I was. He reached his hand up to give me a business card. He had a big smile on his face and this look that said he wanted me to call him. I took the card and smiled back at him. I asked him if he wanted my card. I was in my car driving down this circular ramp to leave. Now there were walls and sidewalks on each side of the ramp. There were employees on these sidewalks dressed in costumes like clown costumes and storybook characters, like girls in pretty dresses. It was part of a promotion to sell the pumpkins. I am now on a bus with this young man, though I don't know where we are headed. We have three green pillows with us. One is a body pillow and the other two are standard size pillows, but they are all made the same and with the same green fabric. The bus is crowded, more than full. He and I are both standing. He is standing right next to the back of the bus and I am standing a few feet in front of him. There is a woman sitting in the back seat, on the right of the bus as I face the back. She is tall and thin with very short blond hair. She reminds me of Gretchen. There are other people standing as well. We know we are close to our stop so we are reaching to get our things together so we can get off quickly. There is a horizontal strap attached to the back of the bus that is used to let the driver know that you want to get off. The young man I'm with reaches down and pulls on the strap. While we were standing there he apologized to me for something. I thought that was very mature of him, that most men wouldn't even realize that they had done something to apologize for. I smiled at him and asked him if he wanted to start over. He smiled and nodded his head yes."
"1274"	"(2006-04-26)"	"I was living at my birth home. Five or six of us were having dinner at the kitchen table. I think I had finished eating so I got up and went into the living room. I was standing by a window thinking about something and felt my eyes begin to water so I went into my bedroom so no one would see. I was standing by the back window in my bedroom. The blinds were drawn halfway up and just partially open. There were curtain panels on each side of the window, pulled back with tiebacks. The window itself was open, though the screen was in. I was standing by the left curtain panel looking out the window and began to cry. It started to rain. I just stood and watched and listened to it rain, continuing to cry softly. I didn't want anyone to know or hear that I was crying. The rain became much, much more intense. It was blowing into the room through the screen. I stood there for several minutes before I realized this. When I finally noticed, I looked down and there was a pool of water on the hardwood floor along the wall, about the width of the window. I don't know why it would have pooled there rather than running out over the rest of the floor. I quickly ran out of the bedroom to the bathroom. There was a pile of towels on the floor. I was trying to find one that didn't feel too wet. I finally just took one and went back into the bedroom to mop up the water. As I was doing this I heard someone call me, telling me there was someone there to see me. I quickly went into the hallway, just far enough for him to see me so I could tell him to come back to my room. I still didn't want my family to see that I had been crying and I didn't want to leave him standing out there long enough for any of them to ask who he was or to ask him any questions. It was my therapist. He was a very thin man, about six-feet tall, with very short brown hair parted on the left side. He was wearing a suit and tie and glasses that had thick black frames. He came into my room and closed the door behind him. There was a chair sitting in-between the wall and the bed, kind of in the middle of that area and facing the back window. I returned to standing by the window where I had been. I was thinking that my parents were going to be upset about a man being in my bedroom and I would need to explain who it was and why I took him in my bedroom. I decided I would just tell them he was a professional acquaintance and I just needed to talk to him someplace that I would be assured of privacy, that no one would overhear or walk in on our conversation before we would realize it. There was something about our conversation that I wasn't being very nice in the way I answered his questions."
"1275"	"(2006-04-27)"	"A marketing company was coming up with a campaign for its client company to introduce their new line of fabrics. Once they had come up with their idea they invited executives of their client company to come to their office so they could present the campaign. A key part of their campaign was to take a piece of one of the fabrics, approximately 3 foot square, and highlight the design of the fabric using candy in wrappers. The design in the fabric was somewhat of a floral pattern. So they would attach candy in various colored wrappers to re-create the design of the fabric using the candy. It was time for the executives of the client company to arrive at their office. Their office was an old home that had 13 stories. Each floor did not have that much square footage. The home was shades similar to an office tower building. Because it was a home there was no elevator. The staircase had a wooden banister and rail, very similar to an oak color. An executive from them marketing company told the client company about their idea. In theory, the client company liked the idea. Their concern was that people would pull the candy off of the fabric to consume it. The marketing executive said that they would display it in a way and in a position that people wouldn't be able to do that. However, when they were finished with the display they would change the way it is displayed and where it was displayed so that people could pull the candy off. The marketing executive is now going to take the client company up to the 13th floor. Having gone up just a few flights of stairs she realized that there was something on the 13th floor that had to be taken care of before the client company got up there. Someone had been killed by an employee of the marketing company. She began practically running up the steps ahead of the client company to get up to the 13th floor to tell one of the other employees that they had to hide the body before the client company got up there. It almost seems as though the employee was trying to hide the body in between a set of mattresses. They were tucking pieces of clothing that were hanging out back in between the mattresses. There was some kind of a noise coming from the pipes in the building. The best I can describe it is somewhere in between a clang and a thump. After the client company leaves I am on the 13th floor taking a shower. The noise in the pipes becomes much louder. From inside the shower I say something to the marketing executive about how much louder it is. She said she had noticed it too and agreed with me. Earlier we thought that it had something to do with the dead body. Now we realize that it has something to do with the water pipes and the water heater. I and someone from the marketing company went to the DDSI regional office to talk to them about promoting this line of fabrics. I see Vince P and wonder if he's going to talk to me since he has not returned my calls or letters over the last few years. We are sitting in a room that has racks of fabric sample books hanging on them. There are a few decorators in there going through the fabrics. We're talking to someone about this marketing campaign. Vince P walks by my left side once or twice and looks down at me but doesn't look me directly in the eyes. He finally comes over and sits in a chair to my right. We're sitting perpendicular to each other. I'm explaining to him what we want to do with a one-month trial marketing campaign and we want to offer it only to his region. The decorators are saying how much they like our fabrics and that our fabrics are always their first choice."

I was trying to tell him how much I consume each day in dairy products, thinking that it was enough. When I started telling him I realized that it wasn't as much as he wanted me to consume. I knew I was going to have to start drinking three 12 ounce glasses of milk a day instead of the 1 or 2 that I currently drink. "
"1277"	"(2006-04-27)"	"I had a piece of furniture that I was taking to Rosalie K and Denis K. I'm not sure why. I was standing in the front foyer of their home. There was a doorway into the kitchen to my right and a doorway into another room in front of me. They are both standing at a kitchen counter facing me, with Denis K standing nearest to me, to the left of Rosalie K. We're talking and I said something to Denis K about teaching at MC. He responded and then laughed with his usual robust laugh. I saw that Jennifer K and her family were there. I had mixed feelings about this but decided it would give us an opportunity to talk more casually since there were plenty of other people around. The piece of furniture I had brought them was about the same height and width as my bedside table but only about half as deep. It had visible legs on the bottom. It almost looks like a bookshelf. It's not in very good shape. I carry it to the back of their house. They have a patio that is the full length of their house. In the dream their house is much longer than in waking life and the patio has an awning over the entire thing. The patio was full of furniture that they intended to refinish. There were six more pieces that they had stripped but not done anything more with. When I saw that I felt better that someone else does the same thing that I do, having started refinishing three different pieces but not having finished any of them. Someone else brought a couple of pieces of furniture up and sat them down near where I was talking with Rosalie K. I told her that she has the coolest things. She told me I was welcome to take one of the pieces that were just placed near us. I walked closer to look at them and realized it was five different chairs. I was disappointed but I didn't want her to know that. I didn't really like any of them but I felt that I had to choose one because her offer was based on what I said. They were sitting very close together so I couldn't get a very good look at any of them so I pulled them apart so I could see each one well. Three of them I ruled out immediately as not being ones I would take. One of them was a straight back chair and told her it was kind of interesting. The seat was round and the back was oval shaped. It was upholstered with a fabric that looked like needlepoint. I really didn't like it either but I was trying to think of something positive to say. I told her that I need a straight back chair for reading because it is best for my back. The fifth one was a very odd shape, kind of like a half of an empty egg shell, lengthwise half. I sat down in it to try it. You could lean back in it, but it went back way too far for my comfort. I was afraid I was going to fall over backwards. I really didn't want that one either and I also didn't want to take one just because she had offered me one, yet I didn't want to give her the wrong impression. It would seem very odd that I said what I did when they were set down there but now didn't want one when she offered it to me. Maybe it was a matter of credibility. Fortunately, someone walked up and started talking to us so I was off the hook. We were discussing the furniture that they had there. They were saying that they needed to get rid of some of it, or organize or clean up the patio. I'm just not sure. I am down in the basement with Rosalie K, walking along the back wall that would run parallel to and along the patio. She said something about needing to get rid of something along that wall but that they hadn't done it because they knew it was going to be a major project. I made the comment that maybe it wouldn't be as bad as they think. She didn't seem to like that I said that. The look on her face made me wonder if she thought I was insinuating that she didn't know what she was talking about. I must have told her that I would help her with it because we start taking things off the wall or moving things. It appears to be a very old, very large, copper store built into the wall and surrounded by brick on the inside of the wall. The brick goes all the way to the ceiling. It is maybe a 5 foot square. The stove top comes just above my waist. We started by moving some things along the ceiling. It didn't take us long to do this. Now the stove is no longer surrounded by brick - it's as though the brick was never there. There is also no wall behind the stove, separating it from the outdoors. I told her that now all she needs is to get a couple of men with a two-wheeler to just wheel it out. Even though this was true, Rosalie K seemed irritated by this, as though it bothered her for me to be right. We're standing on the patio again and talking about the furniture. I realize that I'm not going to have a chance to talk to Jennifer K at all because it was time for me to leave. I told them that I needed to go. Just as I did, someone, maybe Jennifer K , pointed to a piece of furniture and asked if that was the piece that I had wanted - a piece they had agreed to give to me some time ago. I looked and recognized it though it looked pretty different. I remembered that when I saw it the last time it looked somewhat like two buffet pieces, one sitting on top of the other. It also had a row of decorative spindles across the front. The lower piece had a lot of drawers but several of the drawers were missing. Now it was just the lower piece and the spindles were all missing. I wondered if Daddy or Brian F might be able to make new drawers for me. I didn't really know that I wanted it anymore - not the way it was. Without the other pieces it had lost its uniqueness and charm. I think they must have realized all of these pieces were gone because several of them started looking for the pieces among the piles of furniture and stuff on the patio. I recall seeing someone climbing on things to look for the missing pieces. It also looked as though they had stripped it. Maybe they had forgotten they had told me that I could have it and that I was going to refinish it. That didn't really bother me that they had stripped it already. I just felt awkward about the whole thing. As they are looking for the pieces, I realize that I'm not going to be able to take it home with me anyway because it won't fit in my car. I'll have to find someone with a truck and ask them to come and help me."
"1278"	"(2006-05-01)"	"I was a student in a class. It was the first of a series of classes. Diane S and Paulette W were both in the class. There were two female instructors. I was talking with one of them. I told her that Diane S, Paulette W, and I have been in school together for 22 years. For one part of the class, there were three different topics that we had to do a presentation on for the class. Two of the topics I was extremely comfortable with, but the third I wasn't comfortable with at all. It was very foreign to me. I had asked the one instructor if we could split them up or if we had to do all three topics at once. I explained to her that if we could split them up I would be very comfortable doing either of the first two topics at any time and even going first if she would like. The other one, however, I would really need to do some work on so I was not comfortable being the first presenter if I had to include it at that time. However, they scheduled me to be the first presenter and I still had to present all three topics because they couldn't be split up. I was meeting with the one instructor individually to help me understand exactly what needed to be covered in each of these presentations. We also talked some about my background. She, too, was very comfortable with me being ready to present the first two topics because of my background and experience. For the third topic, she was trying to help me understand it well enough so I could do a good job on that presentation."

They were trying to figure out what the relationship problem was between Dr. Foreman and Dr. Cameron, why he had a problem with her. Someone said that it was because Dr. Foreman had a romantic interest in Dr. Cameron. As soon as they said it someone else realized that this probably was true, that this probably was the problem."
"1280"	"(2006-05-03)"	"Not everyone on this panel was British. It was a group of people, I think there were 12. They were supposed to be working together on a task, or accomplishing something. The British people on this panel were not eager to get the task accomplished because once they were finished they had to go back to their own country. They wanted to stay in the United States as long as possible. It doesn't seem like they're doing very much to try to be productive or to accomplish the task. I don't really know what the task was. However, each of them had to write a paragraph or two about whatever it was that they were supposed to be doing. There were two new people on the panel. The two new people had written their paragraphs and when they read them aloud they sounded like dating ads. This did not fit the purpose at all."
"1281"	"(2006-05-03)"	"I was in the living room lying on the floor on my back. I was watching TV. I was watching a program that was doing an exercise segment. They had two men demonstrating the exercises. I was doing the exercises along with them. I was noticing just how much I felt the pull in my upper legs and thighs. They were hard to do, which is probably why I felt so much pull as I did them. They were both variations of a squat. You couldn't hold onto anything while you were doing them. The first one was a pretty basic squat. You put your hands on your hips, had your feet about a foot apart, and then do a normal squat. The second one was a little unusual. As he would squat he kept the right leg at pretty much of a right angle. As he squatted into the lower position, he started bouncing gently. I was having trouble doing that. Then he lay back, supporting himself with his arms straightened. He straightened both legs. This is an odd position. He moved into position where he is resting on his shoulders and he has the rest of his body lifted. It's almost like a yoga bridge position, except that his feet are straight out as though they are suspended in midair. He starts shaking his shoulders and then shakes his entire body. I can't make my body shake the way he is. I'm alone in the house and I'm thinking about the weather outside. It's a Saturday. As I was lying on the floor, I thought it sounded like it was beginning to rain or storm. I'm in a kind of gray or melancholy mood. I get up, walk to the patio door, and open the blinds. I was thinking what a dreary Saturday it was and that this is the kind of day when it would be nice to be in a relationship. We could decide together how to spend this dreary day. It was just the kind of day that would be nice to spend with someone special. I see that it is snowing. I had asked Matthew to move quite a few of my flowers outside the last time he was home, which he did. There are probably a dozen of them and they are all in very large flowerpots, the kind that would sit on the floor or on the ground. They were about 2 or 2 1/2 feet in diameter each and probably 2 feet tall. He had lined them up around the perimeter of the patio. I was thinking that I could just line them up in the flowerbeds along the patio and that would be really pretty because they are tall, bushy plants. They have a lot of full blooms on them and there are quite a few different types. I begin to think about this snow hitting them and wondering if I should bring them inside. I think about the roses in particular and that I should probably at least bring them inside. Then I think if the snow does hurt any of them, they will come back to health when the weather warms back up. I don't think it will kill any of them completely. It would just be such a hassle to bring them back inside because I would need to put something on the floor and they're so big and heavy and I would have trouble doing that, which is why I had asked Matthew to take them out for me. It just really didn't seem worth it. The snow is almost like sleet. I opened the door and leaned out a little bit. I leaned back in and shut the door, deciding to just leave the flowers outside. There is a huge truck, taller than the patio door that pulls onto my patio from the left and begins to exit through the back gate as though it is using my patio as a turnaround. As it prepares to pull out through the gate along the back it stops and starts to back up. That's when I realize that the truck is on my patio for reason. They are getting ready to do something to my right side flowerbed. I quickly open the door, rushed outside and stood in the flowerbed. I do this to prevent them from doing anything to that flowerbed. There was more than one person in the truck. I'm thinking that I will stand there all day if I have to do to keep them from doing anything to my flowers. Then I start wondering what I will do if I have to go to the bathroom and wondering if I can go all day without eating. The people decided that they would call the office and then let me talk to whomever they got on the phone so that person could confirm to me that they were supposed to do whatever they were there to do. I thought if they make the call I won't know if they really called the office or not. They could be calling someone they know to pretend they are someone at the office. I could ask the person on the phone for their name. If they gave me the correct name I might know that it really is them. Even so, what if they just know the name of the person in the office? Then I think that maybe if I ask for one of the maintenance men and then asked their name the same thing would be true. I decide that the best thing would be for me to actually make the phone call so I know that I'm dialing the correct number and talking to the actual office people. That way, too, if they had requested that something be done to my flowerbed I could try to talk them out of it. I was going to say standing there and refuse to budge until I got this cleared up."
"1282"	"(2006-05-03)"	"I was standing in my dining room, but there was no dining room table. One of the plants on the individual plant stands had fallen over. There was dirt all over the carpet. It'd sprayed out to the middle of the dining room, where the table would normally be. Back further in front of the wardrobe there is a rectangular flower box that had been sitting on the floor that was also knocked on its side. Actually, it was closer to being turned upside down. What I mean by that is it wasn't exactly laying on the side and it wasn't completely turned over. There had been dirt in it but I can't tell if there were flowers in it or not. I'm also moving one of the plants on the large plant rack. It's one of the medium-sized plants. I know that I'm turning it around but I'm not sure if I might also be moving it to a different shelf on the rack."

"1284"	"(2006-05-07)"	"I was writing a document related to a contest. It was about the results. It was either to explain the criteria for judging the contest or to explain the different levels of winners. There was more than one chapter to this document. Throughout the dream I was working on just one chapter. It was so frustrating and such a struggle. I was discussing it with other people to try to figure out the best wording so it would be very clear to whoever read it. At one point I thought I had a break-through. I thought I had figured out what our sticking point was. I thought that by including this new piece of information our issue would be resolved. We could then finalize the chapter and document. As I tried to finish it with this recent insight, I realized that didn't fix it either. It helped, but it didn't fix it completely."
"1285"	"(2006-05-08)"	"I was recruiting participants for my research. I had six people and just needed one more. I talked to Susan J and Dorothea D to see if they knew of anyone. I am someplace where there is a large gathering of people outdoors for some kind of socializing. It almost seems like a family gathering. I'm standing at the rear of someone's parked car, talking to them as they get something from their trunk. They mention that Paul H might be a good participant. I hadn't seen him in years. A man approaches the car and I hold out my hand to shake hands and ask if he is Paul H. He smiles, and says no. I realize it was either his dad or a brother. Then another man approaches and I do the same thing. He also says no. This one I'm sure is a brother. Then another approaches and I don't want to be wrong again so I don't do or say anything. Someone says something to him about me wanting to talk to him. He smiles and walks over to a lawn chair and sits down. I ask him if he ever recalls his dreams. He is still smiling but looks at me quizzically. I'm wondering if he is just thinking that I must be crazy to ask him, someone I haven't seen in years, such an off-the-wall question. I explain to him that I'm working on some research involving dreams and I need one more participant."

They were supposedly three-wheel vehicles, but unlike in waking life, two wheels were in front and one was in back. The three seats were placed above each wheel. I was looking at them and told someone that one of these would be good for someone I know. I tried one but decided it didn't move very well because there was no back wheel. It was made that way on purpose. In place of the wheel there was something shaped like a suction-cup. Whoever I was talking to asked why I didn't want that one. I held it up and showed them the thing that was on there instead of a wheel and told them that it didn't move very well because of this. There was also a doctor visit involved."

"1288"	"(2006-05-10)"	"I had a meeting with Bill C and Blair K in a restaurant. There was another woman with me but I don't know who. When we arrive at the restaurant, Bill C and Blair K are there already. We sit down at the table and Bill C doesn't say anything to me for a while. I went to use the restroom at the restaurant and I was thinking about the fact the when I took my shower that morning I was in a hurry and didn't have time to wash my hair. I was feeling self-conscious about this so I decided to take a shower in the restroom at the restaurant and wash my hair. Bill C finally asked me what I'm doing now. I tell them that I'm teaching at UI and ITI. People at tables around us all are reacting positively to my announcement that I'm teaching at UI and ITI. Bill C congratulates me and I put both of my hands in front of me with my thumbs up. As I do that I accidentally brushed the hair of a waiter who is bent over in front of Blair K. The waiter is a middle-aged gentleman with medium build and thick, wavy, salt and pepper hair. His uniform is red, black and white. I'm trying to figure out what Bill C and Blair K's reaction really is, whether they're happy for me whether they're just being nice or they're possibly a little surprised. At the restaurant Bill C is sitting across from me, Blair K is sitting to my left perpendicular to me, and the woman I went there with is sitting to my right, parallel to me."
"1289"	"(2006-05-10)"	"I'm in a store looking at fabric swatches. I had been to another fabric store. One store offers free swatches but the other one doesn't. I think that not offering free swatches probably causes the other store to lose potential business. The store I'm getting swatches from is just cutting very thin strips off of the end of the bolt for the swatch. I'm okay with this as it is really all I need. I'm driving down a tree-lined road thinking that whenever I'm on in this road it seems like all of the traffic is going in the same direction that I am. Just as I finish that thought one car approaches me from the other direction. For the first time I realize how narrow the road is and I wonder if there's enough room for two cars going in opposite directions. I have something like a Ziploc bag laying on the front passenger seat and it has crayons, or something like crayons, in it. I'm taking bites off the ends of them. They are supposed to taste like the color they are. For example the peach crayon is supposed to taste like peach. The purple crayon is supposed to taste like grape, etc. At first I think they taste nasty and I quit and take a bite from something else. But then I decide I need to stay with the crayon-like things. They have something to do with why I was getting fabric swatches."
"1290"	"(2006-05-12)"	"There are eight people who are going to be meeting with me on a regular basis for a few months. For some reason I think that some of them might be meeting with someone else. I tell two of them that they will be required to meet only with me. This doesn't really make sense as they should all be meeting only with me. These ongoing meetings are going to be more like therapy sessions than research interviews. I had singled out these two specific people because of something they said or something I saw in their data. Whatever it was I didn't want it to be distorted or altered because they were speaking with someone else, by them or by the person they were talking to. I didn't want someone asking them the wrong questions or saying anything they shouldn't to them because of something they just heard."
"1291"	"(2006-05-12)"	"I had taken a new job working for a retail business or a business that had a retail division to it. When I first took the job I was going to be working in a retail location and it seems that there were no other employees, just the manager. All of the previous employees had either quit or been fired. The ones who had quit did so because it was such a mentally and emotionally undesirable place to work. The others were fired either because they were incompetent or because they were causing problems about whatever was going on there. After the interview, I headed home. I was driving home on a flat piece of cardboard. I have no idea what was propelling it forward or what I was using to steer it. I have no image of anything other than the flat piece of cardboard. The cardboard was lying flat on the ground and I was sitting on it. It was moving forward just like any motorized vehicle. I was really in a hurry to get home, so I was going around 90 miles an hour. It was dusk or maybe even a little bit later. I was thinking about the fact that I was speeding. I hoped it wouldn't be a problem because the cars seemed to be going pretty fast. However, I didn't want to get caught by a police officer either. I think about what I'm using for travel and I think that there's no way that I would even be noticed because I'm so low to the ground. I couldn't get stopped if I wasn't noticed. I had hardly finished this thought when a police officer in the other lane, heading in the opposite direction that I was, motioned to me to pull over. The police officer was driving something that resembled a golf cart. He had two other people with him. One was sitting in the front with him the other was sitting in the back. Both of these were people that he had stopped prior to me. He started to write me a ticket and I begged him not to. I apologized profusely. I explained to him that I had been unemployed for nearly a year and I just really didn't have the money for a speeding ticket right now. He couldn't help but see that I was very distraught by this. Finally, I promised him that I would find a different way home that I wouldn't even get back out on the road tonight. At that point he decided to go ahead and let me go without giving me a ticket. He didn't even write me a warning. I walked back to the place that had just hired me. It wasn't open for business but the door was unlocked so I went back in. When I was there earlier the manager I was speaking with was a man but now it's a woman. I went in to see if there was anyone there who would be willing to give me a ride home. I thought there might be someone there who would be headed home soon and going in my direction. Then they might drop me off at home or drop me someplace close to home where I could walk the rest of the way from there. I had mixed feelings about doing this as I didn't want to impose on anybody, I certainly didn't want to give this impression to my new employer before I even started work. Since I had promised the police officer that I would find a different way home I didn't feel that I had much choice. I didn't know anyone else in the area that I could ask. At first I asked the woman manager. I don't know if she wasn't going to be leaving for a while or if she wasn't going to be going in my direction or maybe she just didn't want to. It occurred to her that there was another employee there, an older man. She suggested I ask him. He was a large man maybe 6 feet tall and a large build. I'm guessing he was about 70-years-old. He looked kind of rough, though not dirty or unkempt, but a bit scary looking. It's just the kind of appearance that in another situation I would have been hesitant to approach him and talk to him. He was doing janitorial work. When I asked him about a ride home he seemed very put off by the idea. I apologize for bothering him and I left. I decided that I would just need to walk home, even though home was on the other side of town. As I left the building I walked down some steps and onto the sidewalk. I realized that the sidewalk would be a shortcut and cut my time almost in half. The sidewalk straight in front of me continued for probably 100 yards or less. Then it turned to the right. After it turned right it continued for a long way. I knew at the end it would turn right again and I would just have a few hundred yards more to go before I was very close to home. I was carrying with me the cardboard that I was riding on earlier, except now it is shaped differently. Now it has four sides on it making it more of a shallow rectangular box. For some reason I lifted it over my head to carry it. I either did that so that I could see where I was walking better, or simply because it was going to be easier to carry it that way. It seems like maybe it was both. The sidewalk where I'm walking reminds me of walking through a park. There's a lot of grassy area and a lot of mature trees to my right. To my left there is a small width of grass and a few smaller trees between the sidewalk and the road. When I first start out, the road is at the same level that I am but the sidewalk goes uphill and the road to my left stays at the lower level. The street runs parallel to the sidewalk. As I'm walking I notice that I'm approaching a huge bridge. I had never noticed this bridge before. It is made of steel beams and girders but I'm thinking how beautiful it is. I don't think in waking life I would think that this is a beautiful bridge. It's very industrial looking it's built up on both sides with each side being a series of arches constructed out of steel beams and girders. I can't see the whole bridge. I don't know if that's because of darkness or fog. But the bridge seems to disappear on the end opposite of me. As I'm walking I see the woman store manager in her car pull up on the street alongside me, heading in the same direction that I am. She slows down and pulls off to the side and stops, so I stopped walking. She had decided to come after me and drive me home. I'm trying to decide whether or not to impose on her and allow her to take me home. There was also something about actually being on-the-job. I was one of the hourly employees, the only new one. The others had all worked there various lengths of time. Some of them had been there a long time and some had not been there long at all. I was talking with some of the other employees. It is a very negative conversation. At least some of it seems to be related to the employer. But they are also talking about some other employees, about something they do or have done. Some of it is not related to the business at all and some of it is. In another part, though, it seems as though I have been hired as part of the executive team. I attend an executive meeting and we are all in a very small rectangular room that seems to have low ceilings and is also not very big in square feet. As the meeting starts the room begins to move in one direction as though it's a vehicle. At the same time the lights become very dim. So much so that we can hardly see each other. I realize now that this is intentional. The room is a moving as though it's a trolley car. And it begins to go underground. It continues to travel underground while we continue our meeting. It almost seems that they do this to maintain secrecy of what is being discussed in the meeting. I, of course, find this all very odd and unsettling and I'm not sure what to make of it. It causes me to question things about the organization and their ethics or their business practices. I wonder if I even want to be a part of this organization."
"1292"	"(2006-05-13)"	"For some reason I had to go back to the office building where the CAS office is located. Obviously, I was very bothered by this, wished that it could be avoided, but knew that it couldn't. I was trying to figure out a way that I could go where I needed to in the building but avoid running into Bill C or anybody else there or to avoid even going by the office or to risk being seen by any of them. Most importantly I didn't want to come face-to-face with any of them, especially Bill C. I must have seen someone from the distance because I decided to go in to the women room thinking that I could go in there and actually go in one of the stalls and just stay there for a little while and give whoever it was time to get where were they were going. If I'm in one of the stalls then there's no chance of Jennifer C coming in and seeing me. And if I just wait for a little while then I can slip out and get where I need to go without seeing any one or without being seen. I'm thinking now about how I can get back to my car without being seen or without seeing any one. I think about going to the far end of the building by the deli to exit the building and then walking around the outside to my car because if I walk around the back of the building they would have to actually be back there for them to see me or for me to run into one of them and that would be highly unlikely. I don't know if I had parked at the front of the building where I usually parked or if I had parked at the one and where I sometimes parked. If I was parked on the end then there would be just a miniscule chance of seeing someone or being seen. If I was parked at the front my chances increase considerably because they might see me through a window or I might run into one of them in the parking lot since that's where they parked as well. Maybe I was just thinking that I should have parked at the end of the building recognizing that then it would have reduced my chances greatly of seeing one of them or being seen by one of them. Regardless of any of this, I was unsuccessful. I came face-to-face with Bill C. We were only a few feet apart when we realized that the other was there. So there was no chance of acting as though we hadn't seen each other. I looked up at him and didn't say anything immediately. I get the sense that it bothered me a lot more than it bothered him to run into each other. I think he recognized this and was trying to be especially pleasant or friendly. I think he probably knew how much I didn't want to see him. I may be recording this in the wrong order. Alot of this doesn't make sense to me. I am in their office suite to do something. I was talking to Jane C and as in previous dreams she was sympathetic with me about what happened and seemed to be on my side. She also suspected that I did not want to see Bill C. So when it was time for me to leave she said that she would go into his office and stand at the end of his desk and talk to him so that I could go out the front door of their sweet without him seeing me and without me seeing him. She offered to do this because I would have to walk by his office door to get out of the office suite. There were several women working there. Jennifer C didn't work there anymore though. The receptionist was now a woman with a very unusual name something like Oneka. I recall seeing it on something on the wall or maybe on a tall file cabinet. It's in big block letters may be you when you try block letters. I would guess her to be around 60 years old she appeared to be in very fit, good physical condition and a nicely dressed her hair was nicely taken care of in a style that you might expect to see on someone 70 years old. Very pretty silver-gray hair. I don't know if she knew that I had worked there before or even if she did I don't know if she knew anything about what had transpired especially regarding my leaving the company. I'm having a conversation with these women which included Jane C and the receptionist, it seems that the conversation is about things that they're working on right now or the ways that they are you are doing things right now or maybe some of the changes that have taken place since I've left. I'm having a conversation with Bill C and it seems that he is trying very hard to mend fences. He's trying to do this, though, without actually mentioning anything that happened. Certainly he's trying to do so without any apologies or accepting any responsibility for anything that happened. I had a sense that my name had come up in conversations between him and Bill C over the past year and that it wasn't in a positive or flattering way. I know how sarcastic bill can be. I know that he doesn't always speak kindly of other people. For some reason I think that when my name came up it was related to specific events or situations or maybe specific things that I did or put in place while I was there. Bill C and I are walking out to the parking lot as we continue to talk. As we approached the door of their office suite I hear Bryan N behind us make some kind of a wisecrack. I think he said, maybe like the directory? He was implying that there was something negative about AE directory that I may have created while I was there. I don't recall creating any directories but I have a feeling that he was referring to the new employee manual. I nor Bill C acknowledge what he said. We just keep walking. After we get outside the building in the parking lot I said to Bill C that I suppose he and Bryan N have had a lot of laughs at my expense over the last year. His response was a sarcastic agreement with me as though he was trying to make me believe that it wasn't true. One of the things that I learned about Bill C though, that was his way of avoiding admitting that he had done something inappropriate or wrong or hurtful to someone, especially if he was aware of it at the time he was doing it.

I was standing near a gate that I thought was where I came in. I took a few steps forward leaning to my right to look but then would step back again because I wasn't sure. I did this several times. In between I would look around to see if something else looked more familiar. Taylor walked up and asked me if something was wrong. I told him that I wasn't sure if this is where I came in. He said he was going to walk with me, to make sure I found my car okay. I thanked him for being so kind but also said I didn't want to bother him - especially tonight of all nights. He had much more important things to do, and family and friends who were waiting on him. He insisted on staying with me until I found my car. There were 2 or 3 people with him. We walked several places but nothing seemed to be right, even to him. He decided that we would walk to their car and then drive around until we found my car. I was so amazed that he was being so nice. "

When I bent down to see what it was I found three Easter eggs. Someone had emptied the contents of the egg with pinholes before decorating and hiding them. They were elaborately decorated. Two of them were actually stuck the tree at the end of each egg. I gently pulled them off the tree, as I didn't want to break them. I think the third one was just lying on the ground.

I was very hesitant about this, partially because most of them never want to come here and partially because it meant I would need to take the time to clean my house. I really didn't feel like I had the time to do that right now. Jody S is there and we're talking about it with some of the others who are on the phone. Mother is one of the people on the phone. They say something about bringing cleaning supplies with them for me to use after they all leave. I finally agreed. Darren and I are each doing separate things but talking while we are doing whatever it is. He asks me if Chris A and Edith A will be coming, that he hopes they will. I say that I don't know that they will because they aren't often able to participate in family gatherings unless it is a special event like a wedding. He says something about it not being that far of a drive from TH. I tell him that they don't live in TH. I don't like the tone I use when I say this to him. It's the kind of tone that when people use it on me makes me feel like they think I'm an idiot. I tell him they live in Mount Vernon. He doesn't know where that is and I try as best I can to explain to him. I go outside and am walking around the house looking at the flowerbeds on each side of the house. I'm starting to pull the few straggler weeds that I spot because I went the beds to look nice when the family comes. I'm standing looking at the various plants in the front flowerbed and realize that I don't remember what they all are because most of them aren't blooming yet. I decide that I'll just have to get out my flowerbed plan because I know when Mother comes she will ask me what they are. I bend down to pull a weed from the front flower bed and a thick, long root comes up with it. It comes out fairly easily. I was surprised by this root but also surprised that it came up so easily. I spot another and pull it up and the same thing happens. It's another of these thick, long roots. I turn and look at the front yard and realize that the entire yard is riddle with these roots lying just beneath the surface of the grass. You can tell where they all are because they push the lawn up just a bit wherever they are. The pattern they create reminds me of varicose veins. Darren comes out and I tell him that I don't like the idea of my family seeing the yard look like this, that I think we should pull them all up. I realize that it will disturb the grass and it still won't look as good as a healthy lawn, but I think it will look better than these roots. I think this looks disgusting, diseased. He doesn't seem to want to pull them up. I don't know if it's because he thinks it will just be impossible, too hard, or he simply just doesn't want to. I pull one up to show him how easily they come up and toss it to the side. It requires hardly any effort at all. I pull another one up and it comes up just as easily. I realize that Darren just isn't going to help. I stand there looking at the huge front lawn and debating whether or not to attempt to pull them all up by myself before the family gathering. "
"1296"	"(2006-05-25)"	"I am in one of the very first pews of a church, kneeling and praying. There is hardly anyone else in the church because there is no Mass or service going on. I just went there to pray. I get up and start to leave, walking down the middle aisle. I notice a large group of children in the back of the church. Their teachers have them sitting side-by-side in the last few pews, on both sides of the aisle. They are talking to them about the church and about the Catholic faith tradition. I hadn't walked far when I realized that I left my handbag in the pew where I had been praying so I went back, picked it up, and then left. I think there is a group of children outside the church also, standing on both sides of the entry doors. [It gets confusing from here.] There are quite a few steps outside of the entry doors. They are very long steps and fairly steep, but maybe more than one flight as well. I only recall going halfway down. Now I am walking to the front of the building, from outside, from the right of the building. I think there is a sidewalk that runs all the way around the perimeter of the building. Maybe two levels, as though it is two steps. As I turn the corner to the front of the building I see Sherry S on the second, lower level. We acknowledge each other with our eyes and a smile. The only thing that she says to me is something about the fact that I'm letting my hair grow out. I said something about it being at that painful stage where it's too short and too long to do anything with it so it will look nice. I came around to the front of the church again, and again from the right side. Sherry S and I acknowledged each other with our eyes again but this time didn't speak. I am now at a store. I don't know if it's a drugstore or a discount department store. I went in because there were a few things that I needed. I saw that they still had Easter candy on sale. I decided to walk by it just to see if they had any Peeps. There were a couple of things that I picked up and pushed on the package because they kind of looked like Peeps but I couldn't tell for sure. I decided that they were but there were a different kind than normal. I couldn't decide if I really wanted to buy them, because of the calories, because they weren't the normal kind and I wasn't even sure if I would like them, but also because of the money, even though it was such a small amount. I look at some of the other Easter candy that they have there. I'm moving some of it a little bit to see what it really is. It's mostly things that I haven't seen before. I pick up a basket that has nothing but Peeps in it, but then change my mind and put it back. I have a hard time getting it to go back on the shelf where it had been. It had been in kind of a corner, where two shelves meet. Then I pick up a few that are individually wrapped but put them back also. I spot a few boxes of the traditional kind of Peeps. I also notice that they still have some left-over Christmas candy as well. There is one thing that is either in a container that looks like a toy soldier or maybe it's chocolate shaped like that with a foil wrapping that looks like a toy soldier."
"1297"	"(2006-05-26)"	"I was at an event and saw Barry C there. I walked by him without saying anything and then, returning, walked by again with no intention of saying anything to him. As I walked by this time he said something, as if to himself but intending for me to hear him. It was very sarcastic about me not wanting to talk to him. I walked a few steps closer to him, pointed my finger at him, and almost angrily said, and that's exactly why. I turned and left the room. I was thinking that I am just so sick of his constant criticism. I had an adult daughter who had been out socializing with some of her friends. I was concerned about her drinking, or having too much to drink. Her father and I were divorced. It wasn't Darren. I was insisting that she come back. We weren't at home, maybe at a hotel. We insisted that she come in for the night. He and I agreed to stick together on this and between the two of us make sure that she did stay in. When I thought she had snuck out and then realized that she hadn't, I apologized. She said it was okay. I checked on her once or twice after that and both times saw her sound asleep in bed. I had gone to a women room. I must have been having a period because I was changing my tampon. I put the wrapper in the little disposal container attached to the wall of the stall. I stepped to the side of the toilet as I was doing this. I did this because I didn't want anyone outside the stall to see my feet. But then I realized if they didn't they might try to come in and I didn't want that so I stepped back around to the front."
"1298"	"(2006-05-26)"	"Working with a group of people to plant things in what resembled landscaping beds. After everyone was done, I and someone else were watering them. We saw that some of them had been planted wrong. We were talking about what we might be able to do about it, or if we should or would do anything about it. "
"1299"	"(2006-05-26)"	"I was working for Bill C to cover the phones mostly, while Jennifer C was out. We seemed to be working out of a house. In two different rooms there were coffee cups with pens and pencils in them. They were almost too full to get a pen or pencil back in once you took it out. I saw that there were quite a few unsharpened, yellow, number 2 pencils in each one. I took all of those out and put them in a drawer to make the pens and pencils in the cups easier to grab and to put back. Bill C had a television commercial produced. When he came back we were talking about it. He said he got to touch the cameras. I repeated this as a question, with lots of excitement in my voice, because I knew he probably really enjoyed that. He smiled, nodded his head, and said yes. I thought this commercial would lead people to believe that this is a much larger company than it is. He was hiring another person to do the same thing as Bryan N. I knew Bryan N wouldn't be happy about this because his ego won't allow him to think someone could be his equal."
"1300"	"(2006-05-28)"	"The entire cast of West Wing was in this dream. Martin Sheen had died and we were attending the visitation service. In the dream this was not part of the TV program but it was what would have been a waking life events. I was there at the visitation services will everyone was very sad but I seemed unusually distraught and emotional. I don't know why but I was crying a lot. As typically happens at visitation services, there are a lot of discussions about him, the man that he was. Some people felt that he should have truly been president."
"1301"	"(2006-05-28)"	"Again it was the cast of West Wing but this time Martin Sheen was alive and they were celebrating the end of the series of the TV series. I have no idea how this fits but I am parking my car in a parking lot that reminds me of the parking lot at my elementary school. And I have fooled into a parking space at the end of the building there are quite a few cars parked there and as I pull into a parking space I realize that there is a very expensive car let me be a Mercedes parked at an angle to my left where the rear of that car is facing my driver side door. There are a lot of people around and for some reason I decide not to stay parked there so I decide to go I see that the adjacent part of the parking lot that is perpendicular to that one is almost empty so I decide to go park over there. I was thinking that if I do that it would be easier to get out after Mass. After I pull over to that part of the lot I decide to park differently than I originally intended. So I kind of circle around then pull into the front of two attached parking spaces but where two spaces would be connected. I pull into the front of those so that I can just pull straight out when I get ready to leave. That space is also the very first space on the end of the row and is nearest the door of the church. I walked over to the church and joined a conversation that was already in progress with a few people. They were discussing some woman. I can't figure out if there was just some problem with this woman or if she had died. But they didn't seem that upset that she had died. They seemed more upset about something else related to her. Or maybe it was something related to her dying but not the fact that she had died. Someone then said something about Darren and they wondered if he had died. I said I was pretty sure that he hadn't. I think he had just left town without telling anyone or at least without telling anyone where he was going or when he would be back - if he would be back. I went to talk to a man that I knew who was a police officer. He was going to file an official report about Darren. He was going to send a couple of officers to my house to do a search for clues to try to figure out what happened or where he went. It seems to me that he had just disappeared because he was trying to avoid something that I wanted from him - like maybe financially something that was due me and he was trying to avoid paying me what he owed. I was going to give them a form to make it official and I got ready to print it out. I printed one out then I realized that there was a lot of information on there that I could have filled in myself to make this easier for them. So I did that and I printed out another one."

"1303"	"(2006-05-30)"	"Susan J contacted me to see if I still had the things that Dorothea D had given to me as a donation for some organization that I was involved with. I don't know what the items were or what organization that was. I still have them because I had changed my mind about what I was going to do with them. Dorothea D wanted them back. It seems that a lot of it was clothes but there was something unusual about them that I can't explain. Susan J and Dorothea D came to pick them up. I think Dorothea D was trying some of the clothes on, but it seemed more like a little girl dressing up in mommy's clothing. It was certainly different that just her trying on her own clothing. Freda L also showed up. The three of them were acting very distant to me. I was very happy to see them, yet very sad when I felt the distance. I was sad that they didn't seem as happy to see me as I was to see them. It seems that we were together in a small town that we grew up in. All of the buildings in the town were being destroyed so the land could be used for something else. The people who live there were destroying their property and things themselves rather than having the company who bought the land do it. It feels as though Susan J, Dorothea D, Freda L, and I had decided that we wanted to say goodbye to our town on our own terms. There was one place in particular, a local gathering place, maybe something like a coffee shop. It was the kind of place that someone might describe as the heart of the town. It was a place where people always came together. People wanted to say goodbye to it together and on their terms not this company's terms."

"1309"	"(2006-06-06)"	"I was looking for a hotel because I wanted to go to the beach for a few days after conference. I had pictures almost like photographs of two different hotels and they were both shaped like airplanes. The front half of each was sitting on pavement and the back half of each was on the beach. I felt like I had stayed at one of them before. So I was thinking that I would probably go to that one again. The part of that one that was on the beach had a wooden deck off what might have been the second story. It's a pretty small desk, but I see a few people sitting there. It looks more like the size of a deck that you would see on a small home. I see some people walking out onto the back to get down to the beach. There are also people walking on the beach. I am walking on the beach. But there are so many people that it's hard to even find places to step without stepping on somebody's things, their blankets, beach bags and such. So in some places I'm taking large steps to kind of step over things. I only walk a few steps and then I started running. As I was running I was trying to step over all of this stuff. I ended up running near the very top part of the beach because that was the most clear. I continued running until I came to the end of the beach. At the end of the beach there was a building of sorts. At the end of the beach was an enclosed area, as though the beach ended in a one-room building. The floor was beautiful, polished, hardwood floor. The color of it is a bit darker than oak. There are several different parts to the floor of this room and they are at different levels, though not consecutively higher or lower. In the middle of the room there is a square cut out of the floor. On all four sides a wall has been built up around it to keep people from falling into the hole. The wall is about three or three and a half feet tall and has a ledge all around the top of it that is about 12 inches wide. It is made of a similar hardwood, though maybe a variation in the color. All you can see as you look into the hole is the ocean. There is a flight of steps that leads down from where we are. Mostly though, it feels like a dead-end. I stop for a few minutes to take in the room. I'm wondering what it is, why it is there. As I'm standing there, Allison Janney, an actress from the recent TV program West Wing comes in. She has also been running on the beach. We look at each other as if to acknowledge this unusual place that we've entered. I now notice someone else in the room, a man. I don't know if he was there earlier and I just didn't notice him or if he just came in. If so, I didn't see him enter. Maybe he had come up the steps. He is now going back down. He is aware of our presence but doesn't look at us or acknowledge us in any way. I think I turn around to leave."
"1310"	"(2006-06-07)"	"I am in a hospital and there is a woman sitting at a work counter. She is filling out forms. She has a lot of them to fill out. I am laying on something in front of her, on my back. I am venting. I stopped several times and apologized and she told me that it was no problem and I should go on, that she just needed to fill out those forms while she was listening. She said that she could listen while she does that. I told her that I didn't want to bother her but yet I really appreciated her listening. She said again that it wasn't a problem at all, as long as I needed to talk. So I just kept talking. Now I'm lying on the floor and there are two people lying on either side of me. It seems like it is Chandler and Joey from the TV program friends. We are helping this woman with the forms. She tells us that she really appreciates it because she has gotten behind. The form that she's filling out looks like one sheet of ruled or lined paper. It does have some kind of a heading at the top; part of that heading is the month. We do two of these and put them in file cabinets and then we reached for the next one. We thought we only had one more to do to be caught up. But when we reached for the next one we realized there are still three or four more. While I was lying on the floor I asked for a pillow because there was something that we were looking at while we were doing this and I was having trouble seeing it from that position. They handed me one pillow but that wasn't enough so they handed me a second one. That was much better. Then someone else wanted one also. I think it was Joey. I'm pretty sure that I'm in a hospital and I was in a meeting. After the meeting I was walking down the hall and I passed someone else who was in that same meeting. It was a young woman. I passed a room with an open door that looked like some type of office space. It's not clear though what it is used for. Later I am in the room and there is stuff piled everywhere, office furnishings, desktop accessories, etc. The furniture isn't arranged in any kind of usable order it's just like it's all shoved in there for storage. There are a couple of people in the room. It appears that they are moving in to work there. I realize that there are going to be quite a few people working together in this room. One man who's going to be working in there is standing at one of the desks doing something, like he's setting up the desk. He seems to have a bad attitude. I think it's because he doesn't want to be working in a space with other people. He wants his own office. "

I'm carrying a bowl of ice cream. The bowl looks like one of my dessert bowls that I use in waking life. I would like to wait until I get home to eat it but there's no lid on it and it's very warm outside. I'm still far enough from home that I'm pretty sure it's going to be almost completely melted by the time I get home. I just don't want people to see me walking down the street eating ice cream. I decide to take a shortcut through one of the back streets where there won't be anyone or hardly anyone around and then I will just go ahead and eat it as I'm walking."

I was just allowing them to have this meeting at my home. I'd noticed that they might run out of chairs. I told one or two of them that they were welcome to pull any of the chairs from the dining room into the living room. There were three different kinds of chairs in the dining room. I told them to feel free to pull whichever ones were most comfortable into the living room, and as many as they needed. There was also a conversation about housekeeping. I must have apologized for my house not being cleaned. Someone had tried to reassure me that it's fine. I explained that since I live alone and so seldom have people in my home I don't make housecleaning a priority. With having so many other things to do housekeeping seldom seems that important. I usually know in advance when someone is coming so I have time to clean before they come. There is also something about food or refreshments."

"1318"	"(2006-06-14)"	"I had an appointment at UI with the sociology Dean. He wants to arrange a meeting between the two of us and the psychology dean. It's early afternoon and pouring down rain. The psychology dean can't meet with us that afternoon so I was invited to spend the night on campus. Apparently the room where they had me stay is not usually used for this purpose. There's something odd about it I don't know if it's the reaction of some people who work there or what it is. There were long narrow windows. I don't know if they were on a door or on the wall that looked into the outer room. I was trying to figure out how I could cover them so no one would see in while I was getting dressed. I finally noticed at the top of each window, it was barely noticeable, but they each had a rollup shade that could be pulled down. At the bottom of each window was a little space and then there was another very small window. I tried to pull the shade down to cover both but it wouldn't go that far. I decided that the lower one was low enough that it wouldn't make a difference. The dean of the psychology department shows up and says that he can't meet with us until six o'clock that evening. I didn't really like this because I didn't want to stay around there all day but I also didn't want to drive all the way home and then all the way back again that evening. I could tell that the other employees that were standing around didn't like him telling me this. They thought he was just being hard to get along with. Apparently they thought he really could have met with us if he had wanted to. I think he must have sensed this because he was being very adamant that he could not meet in the morning. I was trying to be nice about it and I just kept saying that's fine that's fine I'll come back. He said that he had to go to his church that morning because he was getting his tails. I didn't know what it meant but could tell it was a big deal. Like some kind of accomplishment or recognition. I congratulated him on receiving them and then I just told him that I would be back at six. Whoever was scheduling the meeting asked me if I was sure. They said that they didn't want to schedule it if I wasn't going to show up. I said I will be here at six. I was pretty irritated about it though. I just didn't want to drive all the way home and turn around in a few hours and drive all the way back. That was the reason that I had spent the night the previous night to prevent me from having to make two trips down there. There were maybe eight or ten people who worked together in the sociology department. They had a good time working together. They got along well and had fun. They laughed a lot. They had some little rubber balls that were maybe an inch in diameter and multicolored. It was the kind that you would get out of a machine like the gumball machines. They were throwing them at each other. One of them came at me and I caught it but I was reluctant to throw it. I did want to hurt anybody or break anything."

There was something about recognizing people close to us, like family members who support us during the difficult parts of being an SAID volunteer. Recognizing how important that support is, how much we value it. I said something about someone in my life. I don't recall identifying who that someone was. I have a sense that it wasn't Matthew, but it had to be him. I said something about him being my torch bearer. As soon as I said it I realized how accurate it was. It made me that much more aware of how important that person is and how much I value their mental and emotional support, especially with this part of my life. It was related to him even just listening and how valuable that is to me and wanting to recognize him for that, to make sure that he knows how valuable that is to me, how important it is to me."

We either knew each other or had met before. I was just slightly bothered by something that was going on. Taylor was acting as I think any friend would. I don't think he was actually trying to comfort me, because I don't think I was that upset. I suppose I could best describe it as him being very supportive. He was standing to my left yet turned slightly so he could easily see my face. He slipped his right arm around the back of my waist. Even as we walked away together he kept his arm around my waist. I don't think I have ever felt so totally and completely comfortable with someone. It was a feeling of total trust, trusting that he would never judge me no matter what. It was a feeling of complete safety. It was a feeling of genuine love, caring, and acceptance. There was something about the number 600. Going down a gravel road that ran along the right side of a house, when facing the house. I can't get a sense of whether I was in a car or walking. It's almost as though I'm looking down at it from distance, as though I'm floating in the air, and thinking that it is the road I need to go down with Taylor. Along the right side of the road, opposite from the house, there is a wood fence made of 2 x 4's that form an X in each section. The wood is dark brown, just like you would see a picture.

I really wanted to go in for personal reasons, though I don't know what I intended to say. I know I was very attracted to him. I was holding a LED pen. I had the light on and was using it as a flashlight though it doesn't seem like all the lights are out. I went into his room and it was as light as if it were daytime. He was in bed already, lying with his back to me. I asked if he would mind terribly talking to me for just a couple of minutes. He rolled over to face me and said that it was fine. I was surprised that there were no secret service agents around, but curious as to why there weren't. I told him I would just lie down next to him while we talked if that was okay. I climbed into bed next to him as I said it. We only spoke for a minute or two. He moved very close to me and I thought he was going to kiss me. Just as our lips touched he seemed to fall asleep. I thought this was very odd, and for some reason I was afraid that something was physically wrong. He was so still that I was very afraid that he had died. I didn't want anyone to know I was in there when it happened; maybe I was afraid someone would blame me. I slipped out of bed and went to my own room. The next morning Macy F and I and several other people are in his room. He is sitting up in bed, covered with blankets. Something had happened to him physically and he was now recovering. He was going to be fine. I was so relieved. I wasn't even sure if he remembered anything about the previous night. One of the people in the room is a housekeeper and there are 1 or 2 secret service agents in the room. He, Macy F and I are talking. I was feeling restless so I got up and began picking up the laundry that was scattered about his room and even on top of the blankets that were covering him. I was taking the clothing and rehanging it in his walk-in closet. The housekeeper came in and put some laundry on a big pile on the floor. I realized that because he is the president, if he only wears something for an hour or so they probably send it to be laundered. I took the things I had put on the hangers and put them on the pile on the floor. There were two very light, beige-colored suits. They seemed nearly identical. At first I thought that was odd but then again I realized that it wasn't that strange considering that he is the president. Even the suits went on the pile of clothing on the floor. I went back to his bed to pick up a few more things. He was lying down. As I reached down to pick up some of the clothing he placed his hand over mine. He barely had to move his hand at all to place it over mine. I turned my head slightly to the left and looked down at him. He smiled and in almost a whisper he told me I looked very pretty today. I wondered if he was just letting me know that he was aware of what happened the previous night and that he had tried to kiss me. Maybe he was just trying to very subtly indicate that he was attracted to me as well. I was concerned that Macy F might have heard him but then realized that she didn't."

"1330"	"(2006-07-03)"	"I was standing outside somewhere with Matthew waiting for Shirley J because we were going to help her move. There was a little grassy slope next to the pavement. In one part of the grassy area there was a small pile of sand, about a foot in diameter. Matthew was pretty much just standing in one place but I kept moving around. First I was standing in the grass. Then I moved to the sand pile and was playing with the sand with my right foot. Then I moved onto the pavement. When I walked onto the pavement I noticed a penny. When I bent down to pick it up I noticed another one in a small hole in the pavement. The hole was just barely bigger than the penny and I wondered if I would be able to get it out. That penny was very shiny. There was water in the hole. I was able to get the penny out. Then I found three more, each lying in separate spots. I told Matthew it was a good day when I find a penny, and an especially good one because I found five of them. Darren and Annie H show up to help. They have Kay H with them. I'm thinking about the fact that Kay H is there to help. Then I think that of course she would be. I'm standing facing the car that they arrived in. She gets out of the front seat passenger side and walks toward me. "

She is working for the regional office. I'm very surprised by some of the things she is telling me. I say, ""You're kidding?"" Then she suggests we get together for lunch so she can tell me everything. I agree and ask her what day she has in mind. We're both looking at her calendars and she suggests the coming Sunday. I tell her that won't work for me. I see her look at me like she doesn't believe me. I don't know how this is possible since we're talking by phone. She finally asks me why not and I just say I have another commitment. I don't really. I just don't want to have lunch with her on a Sunday. She seems annoyed and doesn't suggest anything else. I see that I really do have appointments every day that coming week. I tell her we could do Monday but it would be a late lunch. We could Tuesday but I only have an hour in-between appointments. On Wednesday I have several hours open around lunch time. She finally agrees to Wednesday. "
"1332"	"(2006-07-04)"	"I was someplace where there were a lot of other people. It had been raining and the area was flooded. I needed to get from one building to the other and the only way I could get there was by boat. There was no motor so I had to use oars. I didn't have trouble getting to the new location but found it much more difficult to get back. It started raining and storming again and the flooding water became very active and extremely dangerous. People were panicking and scrambling to figure out a way to save themselves from drowning. A lot of people were unsuccessful and died. Some family members present. In a two-story house. Someone brought me a crying baby. It wasn't an infant, but old enough to hold its head up and to almost sit up itself. It was a relative. I think it was a boy. The baby was in a seated position on my right arm. I gently pushed his head down against my shoulder while I began a rocking motion and stroked his head to calm him and help him go back to sleep. Someone offered to take him from me and I told him that it was fine. I said he was scared and just needed to be comforted until he fell back to sleep. I took him back into the house and up to the second floor. The storm had been causing a lot of internal damage. I was trying to clean up some of the damage even though the storm was still going on and still causing lots of damage. Matthew, as an adult, was there. I placed a drawer back in a dresser. As I did so Matthew walked out of the room and I broke down, saying that Matthew, referring to him as a baby, had died. I dropped face down onto the bed and was sobbing. Darren was standing at the doorway saying something to try to comfort me but he was making it sound like it was no big deal. This made me very angry. I continued to sob. The dream starts over from the beginning. This time I and a few other people know what's coming so we start doing things to try to keep people from dying this time. One of the locations where I was had something like a bomb shelter. They opened the door and were trying to encourage people to go in because they knew they would be safe there. Several people had small boxes of herbal tea bags with strings and the little square of paper attached as though they had been individually wrapped. They hadn't been though. They were telling people to reach into the box and take one per person as they would help keep them safe. I knew I didn't have one the first time around so I made sure to get one this time. I didn't feel the same fear this time. I was still feeling, emotionally and physically, the seriousness of the situation. I don't think I felt the same fear or anxiety. Maybe because I knew what was coming and we had a chance to prepare."
"1333"	"(2006-07-05)"	"I was working on a document for the SAID product booth. The document had information that was divided into about 12 different categories. I was working with a few other people and had asked someone to save and close it because I thought it was ready for use at the booth at the next conference. For some reason they didn't do it. I went to do it and I noticed within each category there were three sub-heads. Each one was underlined and in a different color text. As I looked at the text in the three sub-heads of the first category I realized that each one was just a different version of the other two. I knew this would not be good for the volunteers to work from. I thought I could quickly combine the three under each category so I began doing that. I'm sensing some kind of time pressure involved but I don't know what or why.  "

"1337"	"(2006-07-08)"	"It was my first day on the job at the UI. I was to go in and work in the office. I met different people. Someone showed me to my desk. I talked to someone about business cards. One was all black with a graphic on the front with the text. Some of the text was white but not all. Some of it almost seems multi-colored. I was talking to John Mc along with other people. He said something about my finally getting hired there after all of the people I had informational interviews with there and having interviewed there five years ago. I told him how happy I was though I think he knew that. I told him how much I learned from the informational interviews. That I learned about organizations that I didn't even know existed, or learned so much about organizations that I didn't know prior to that. I used U of I as an example. He looked at me as though he didn't know what I meant. I referred to CELL and to CAC. I said I was particularly interested in CAC and the research and work they are doing there. I told him I still had hopes of finding a full-time position there. There were several people who were helping me get settled and get or find the things I needed. They asked me where I was working and I didn't know how to answer them. Later I realized that was silly. That I should have just told them I was going to be an adjunct professor for SAL. I don't know why I didn't think of that. Then I started wondering if I was in the wrong place and that if I had told them that they would have realized that too and could have helped me to find out where I needed to be or to get where I needed to be. I don't know if I really was in the wrong place or not. Apparently the person who should have been getting me oriented wasn't there that day so a number of other people were trying to help that person out and help me. Everyone was really nice. The office space was very crowded. There were several rows of desks and the vertical ends of each desk in each row were almost touching each other. I was going to be in the back row and the far left end, the second desk from the end. Doctor McIlvried's desk was to my right and another man to my left. The two of them were talking. I was thinking that it might make more sense for me to be on the end since these two have to work together a lot they would be able to talk more easily. I didn't think I should suggest it though because I didn't want to create waves on my very first day. I was noticing the people working and their interaction, thinking that I would fit in here very well and wouldn't have any problem getting along with people here. I changed from tennis shoes into other shoes. I was thinking about the fact that I was wearing jeans, even though they were my good jeans. Everyone else was wearing business casual but no jeans. I couldn't imagine why I wore my jeans on my first day of work when I typically don't wear jeans at all. I was only allowed to work 6 hours and it went by very quickly. I was just getting ready to sit down at my desk when I realized my 6 hours was up. I asked someone if I needed to clock out. They said yes and that they would show me where to do that. I was getting ready to go down an escalator but it wasn't like a normal escalator. There was a top on it and not very much of an opening between the escalator steps and the top. I realized I would need to either bend way back or lie down to be able to use it. Even so, I was worried about it. As I was facing the top of the escalator there lots of bookshelves, almost as if I was in a library, though it looked different than in waking life. A woman got on the escalator ahead of me. Now it didn't have a top on it. She was far enough ahead of me that I saw her get off at the bottom when I had only gotten down a little way. I watched her walk a few feet and then get on another escalator, this one going up. I thought this was odd since she had just gone down. Then I realized it must be the quickest way to get to that part of that floor. The escalator steps didn't look like waking life escalator steps. There was very little distinction between the ""steps."" They also seemed to be a mixture of gold, silver, and black and were very shimmery. "

"1340"	"(2006-07-13)"	"Two workmen had come to the house to pick up two pieces of furniture that they were taking to get repaired. Or, the electronics that I keep on the furniture needed to be repaired but they were taking the furniture as well. When they showed up I hadn't cleared the knick-knacks and such off of them yet. They were starting to move them and I wanted to clear those things off first because I didn't want them to take it too. One of the men was taking the one piece that looked like my aquarium stand except that it had a back on it. I was trying to remove the things that were sitting on the lower shelf. He took it outside and I was trying to remove the things as he was rolling it out the door. I hadn't gotten my baby bank off it yet. Something stopped me and he got outside without me. I ran outside to chase him and I didn't see him. I was very upset because I didn't want him to leave with the baby bank. When I got outside there were four or more semi-trucks sitting at different places. There were people everywhere. I didn't see which truck the man took my furniture to. I asked someone and they pointed towards one of the trucks though they weren't sure. I asked someone else and they pointed to another. I was very upset and getting a bit panicked. I decided to go back into the house and just follow the man taking the other piece out because he would be going to the same truck as the first man. The second piece looked like the old entertainment center that was in Matthew's room for awhile. I was taking the stuff off of it. I realized that I had a lot of Christmas decorations attached to this one. Now it looks like the aquarium stand again only this time without a back to it. I'm taking the Christmas decorations off and surprised that they were coming off so easily. I was surprised that I had not put these things away with the rest of the decorations. It seemed that I had not put them away on purpose though, that I wanted to have a reminder of Christmas all year long. I noticed that there was a full-size Christmas tree there as well. It doesn't look like mine in waking life. The branches were sparse, small needles, and far enough apart that they didn't touch each other. It was an orange-brown color. It had hardly any decorations on it and the ones on it were very small. It was nothing like my tree normally looks. It was though I had just noticed that it was still sitting there."

I was trying to visualize my bedroom from where I was laying but couldn't. I was disoriented but so sure that I was awake. I thought if I could visualize my room it would ground me. The noise was relatively loud and constant. I thought maybe it was a storm or some kind, but it's almost as though the whole house is vibrating. I can't move. I'm trying desperately to lift myself from the bed and I can't. I want so much to open my eyes and lift myself from the bed and move my head so I can figure out what is going on. I'm getting more frustrated and upset because I can't. I feel like I was able to lift myself off of the bed a few inches but then fell right back down."

"1343"	"(2006-07-13)"	"I was at an SAID board meeting being held here locally. We were meeting in a very large room. It feels like it is part of my house. Nearly everyone was there. When we needed more chairs I told them they could pull in some of the dining room chairs. Some of the people were sleeping here so I don't see how it could have been my house. I don't have very many extra beds. Dallas K was talking to me about some idea that he apparently thought should be part of the sponsor committee. I asked them if there had been any discussion about forming a PR and Media committee. Whitney P was standing there. I saw her smile when I saw that. She told Dallas K that I was probably asking that because what he was talking about would be more a PR and Media function than sponsor committee. Anything related to sponsor committee is directly related to revenue generation and what he was talking about wasn't. He was talking about publicity or awareness activities. We must have taken a break because I went outside for a walk. The grounds looked like those of a public facility, though I'm not sure what. Maybe a university or a conference center. There were large grassy areas. There was one place that was a large cement area and it had a lot of chairs on it, mostly chairs. They were the height of bar stools but had backs on them. They looked like they might be made of wrought iron. There were also several very large round cement pillars. Maybe they were marble as they didn't look exactly like grey cement. They were probably 3-feet in diameter. There were so many chairs that they were all sitting very close together and I was trying to weave my way through them. 2 or 3 of them had the newer small laptops sitting on them, open and turned on as though someone was using. One of them I thought was probably Malachi B's because every year I see him sitting in that exact spot working. It seems that he had two young children there, a boy and a girl. When the meeting reconvened, some of us were sitting at a large round table. Every time the woman next to me had something to say she sang part of it. There was a piano in the room and someone playing it that accompanied her every time. At first I found this very annoying. But then I found it kind of amusing and it no longer bothered me. I realized who it was. It was someone whose name I recognized as being active for quite some time in SAID and highly respected by most. One woman entered the room dressed in something that gave the impression that she was trying to dress like a baby. She was tall and thin. She had on a headband that made it look like there was a pacifier sitting on top of her head. I wanted to get up and go use the bathroom. I opened a bottom dresser drawer and was moving things around looking for something in particular. It was a similar type of headband. I found it and I was going to put it on before I walked out of the room but I changed my mind. I needed to walk through the circle of people to be able to leave the room to go to the bathroom. At first I felt very self-conscious about this but then I decided not to worry about it. There were some silk fichus trees and some other types of silk trees in the room. "

There was a very large box sitting at the end of one of the aisles on the floor, where an end cap would otherwise be. It had plastic toys in it, like sand buckets, 12-inch balls, and some smaller things that I don't know what they were. The largest of the small things were a little larger than the palm of my hand and shaped like a bowl. The small things were also more of a clear acrylic plastic and the colors were more saturated. There weren't that many things left in the box so I decided to take them out, stack them, and get rid of the box. I put the buckets inside each other. I don't know what I did with the balls. I had then dumped all of the small stuff out onto the floor and was sitting on the floor with my legs crossed, grouping the small items together and then stacking them. I put the largest ones on the bottom and then smaller on top or inside those. There was another small item that was different and couldn't be stacked with the bowl-shaped things. Then there were also three bags of ""pieces"" that went with something else, I think the small things. I decided I would just put the bags behind the counter and we could get the pieces out as we sold the other things. There was another employee, male, sitting on the floor nearby working on something else. A male customer approached the counter with something in a box that he had brought from home. Someone was with him. I got up and went to the counter and asked how I could help him. He told me what was in the box and that it was broken. He wanted to replace it. I didn't know anything about the item so I asked him to wait for a moment while I went to get someone who knew about these things so they could be more help to him. I went into the back of the store and there were several people, I think they were all men but I'm not totally sure, standing there talking. I told one of them specifically that he was needed out front to help a customer. I told him what the item was so he would know why I asked for him specifically. I went back out front. Another customer came up and asked about something else and this was something that I was able to help him with. "

At first it feels that I am just along for the ride but later that doesn't seem to be so. We had directions to the place we are going, which at first seems like someone's home. The driver had read the directions and then given them to me to help us find where we are going. We are driving in the country. We come to the end of one road and we have to turn left or right. The driver confirms that we want to turn left and I say yes. The driver also says something about the road being 35. I see the road sign and confirm that it is 35. Now we are at the site and it seems more like a public place, maybe a university. We are outside and we are helping other people get ready for an event. Someone important is going to be arriving soon. The perimeter of the space where we are preparing for this event is lined with plants and flowers. Some of the flowers are in hanging baskets. I am working with a woman whom I have not met before. We are dead-heading the flowers so they look especially nice for the event. The event is something very important. Someone important is going to be attending. As the woman and I are working on the flowers we're talking about this person and the event and talking about how someone else who is attending will be learning what to do or how to behave when he is in the same or a similar position as this important visitor.

I had to wait for someone else to move out before I could move into the new place. That meant I would have a different parking space but I couldn't park there until I actually moved into the new townhome. I had my microcassette tape recorder and was using it as a pogo stick. There were four other items that I was using in some way other than they were intended. But I was using them as toys in some way. Some people were teasing me, fondly. It didn't bother me at all.

It was two columns and three rows. The cells in the left column were square. The cells in the right column were long rectangles. There were two or three pieces of information in each of the rectangles. Each of the items in each of the rectangles were labeled a, b, and c. The sisters were putting the information in each of these rows. When it wasn't right they had to try again. They kept trying to get it right, using witchcraft. It's as though I was there just waiting for them to figure it out and get it right so I could use it. Right before I woke up they had just one more rectangle to get right.

They put the eggs in this one large cell on this piece of paper, laying in front of me on the table. I was using my fork and kind of poking at the eggs and talking to the person who had made them.

I told them I just wanted to do a quick change of clothes and then I would be ready to go. BJ was standing near the staircase so she immediately started to go upstairs. She was going to help me change so it wouldn't take me as long. As she was going up I told her what I wanted to wear.

Neither the baggage claim area or the area where we rechecked it looked like they do in waking life. The airport was very crowded with people. There was an African-American man and his son. His son had a developmental disability. I'm guessing he might have been 12 or 13-years-old. He was just a little short than I and bit bigger in body size. He had a black artist portfolio with him. He picked it up, turned it vertically and put it under his arm to carry it that way rather than using the handle. It's as though he is being very protective of it. I said something to him about his portfolio just to be friendly. Neither of them were very receptive. I felt bad for bothering them but I was also confused as I didn't know why they would respond the way they did to my effort to be friendly. "

We came outside and were standing on a landing that was 4-5 feet higher than the ground and had a wrought-iron railing. We were looking down at a car. I don't know whose it was. They said they didn't think it would be a good idea for them to drive because the car was small to begin with and then they also had a lot of stuff in it. I said that was fine and that we could take my car. Matthew was going to drive. I went to get in the front passenger seat. I came around the back of the car and just as I did I saw that Mother had gotten in there and Bill F was in the backseat behind her. So I went back around to get in the other side of the backseat. I'm driving and Mother is in the front seat with me. I went to pull out onto a very busy street. For the most part Mother is nervous about being in a car regardless of who is driving so I didn't let it bother me that she was nervous with me driving. I was going to pull out to the left. I looked both ways and started to pull out, thinking that she would tell me if I didn't see something coming from the right. By the time she said it was clear I was already out in the road. Immediately after I pulled out I noticed there was a lot of road construction ahead of me. Lots of rows of orange construction cones to keep cars from using parts of the road and others to designate where the temporary lanes where. I found this confusing and I was getting anxious. I wasn't sure where to go, especially when I approached a fork created by the cones. By the time Matthew told me which fork to take I had already taken the right one, but it was the wrong one. I said it didn't matter. I was going to go up to where I could pull off and let him take over driving."

I think Ross had fixed up Monica and Chandler, but it might have been someone else. There are all standing and talking. He walks away to look for something. Monica and Rachel pick up a magazine that is lying on his coffee table. It's an entertainment magazine. They become suspicious that he is gay. The magazine belongs to Joey since he is an actor, but for some reason Chandler doesn't want to tell them about Joey. Then they find a couple of little things that are props for one of Joey's roles. Because of what they are they become even more suspicious. I can see Chandler in the background. He clearly knows what they're thinking and he's getting upset and frustrated that he can't say anything. Monica and Rachel leave. They sneak out without him realizing it. He must have went into another room for a minute because when he comes out they are gone and they've left the front door open behind them. Just as he enters the room two much younger girls step inside the door and they're bent over giggling. Monica and Rachel had sent them up there for some reason.  "
"1356"	"(2006-07-20)"	"I am in a Victorian home, sitting on a sofa. There is a small pile of vitamins and herbal supplements spread out on the sofa cushion next to me. I am sorting them and putting them each back into their appropriate bottle. Gary S is sitting in an armchair to my right. We are talking about reconnecting after so many years. He is saying something about his age and that he is physically not able to have intercourse anymore. I glanced at him, just from the corner of my eyes and had a half-smile on my face. I was thinking that it didn't have to be that way because I know someone older than him who doesn't have that problem and he doesn't take drugs to help him with that. He then sarcastically says that at least that's the latest he knows about men his age. I immediately think about the familiar sarcastic tone in his voice, knowing that it's not meant to be mean or ugly or anything like that, but that it is very typical for him. Now it's more like I'm daydreaming in the dream about him and wondering what it would be like to reconnect with him. I realize that he is thinking the same thing at the same time. I think to myself that it doesn't do either one of us any good if neither of us is willing to make the first move. Now I'm back at the house and he is talking about someone. I've not heard the name before and I think he is talking about a place because it's unusual and it never would have occurred to me that it was someone's first name. There are 2 or 3 other women in the house in the adjoining room. A young woman enters that room from outdoors. She is talking to the other women while she is leafing through her mail. Gary S and I go into that room. He introduces me to the young woman who just came in. It is his daughter, but not his waking life daughter. She doesn't seem very pleased to see me or meet me. I suppose she is suspicious of my relationship to her dad. He tells her my name when he introduces us but not how he knows me. I wonder if he has told her about me sometime in the past, but that would surprise me if he had. She is almost cold to me. She nods and continues looking through her mail. Then she leaves. I'm wondering about Kelly S, his waking life daughter."
"1357"	"(2006-07-20)"	"I was working at a hospital. I learned that Doctor C had gotten divorced. I saw him in the hallway, rounding a corner walking away from me. He was with a woman that seemed quite a bit younger than him. She was tall, thin, and had long, wavy, black hair. She was very pretty. He was taller in this dream than in waking life. He was going to whiten my teeth for me with a three-step process. He completed the first step then he took what appeared to be a small piece of white paper and place it between my two upper, front teeth. I pulled it out and there was a blue line on it where it had been between my teeth that had something to do with the whitening process. He told me to put it back in and that I needed to leave it in there for a little while. I think I was supposed to leave it there for ten minutes. I'm lying on my left side on an exam table, facing him. He is sitting across the room. While we're talking I was thinking about how much I dislike lying there looking like that in front of him. Now I'm working, but in a different part of the hospital. There is a tall silver, metal cart on wheels, the kind they use to deliver meals to patients. It has candles on several of the shelves. They are different sizes and colors and shapes. Someone has asked me to move them to a certain room in the hospital. I start taking the candles off of the meal cart and placing them on a table that has no wheels. As I'm doing this I turn to my left and ask someone about finding a small cart with wheels to put them on to take them to the other room. The person said this would be a good exercise for me to learn that sometimes what I already have is exactly the best thing to get the job done. I need to recognize when that is the case, rather than spend time looking for something else that I think I need or that I think will be better or best to accomplish whatever it is that I'm trying to do."
"1358"	"(2006-07-21)"	"There were a lot of people around. I don't know where we were or what was going on. I did something that caused me to cut my ring finger on my left hand, right on the outside pad of the finger. I didn't think it was very bad and was holding a tissue over it while I waited for someone to get me a band-aid. I pulled the tissue away once or twice to look at it and see if it was still bleeding. It was. Whoever had gotten the band-aid, unwrapped it for me. As I pulled the tissue away and began to put the band-aid on it started bleeding again right away and very quickly soaked the band-aid with blood. I thought it would be fine, that the band-aid would make it stop bleeding. I wasn't going to worry about it. But I noticed just seconds later that blood was seeping out from under the band-aid. I grabbed another tissue to soak up the blood. Now the blood is almost gushing it's coming out so quickly and so much. My whole had looks like it is covered in blood. I can't soak it all up with the tissue. I rush to a sink so blood doesn't drip onto the floor. A woman who is a nurse comes to help. She snaps at two other people to help. One of them she tells to get some things from the first-aid cabinet and tells them specifically what to get. She is telling the other one that they need to apply pressure to get the bleeding to stop, but she is doing that. I'm wondering if I will need to stitches or if she will be able to stop the bleeding and take care of it without me needing to go to the doctor or hospital. It almost seems that I'm in the basement of my birth home where Daddy had enclosed underneath the staircase so that space could be used for storage but have the stuff being stored hidden from sight. Facing the bottom of the staircase I am to the right, where the washer and dryer and water heater are. There was no sink in the basement in waking life."
"1359"	"(2006-07-22)"	"The third possible answer to a spiritual direction question. Trying to keep a spiritual direction appointment with Father F. It appears to be in St. Joe but there is a black expo event going on. There were cars and people everywhere. I was trying to very carefully drive around to get where I was going. I noticed a space between two cars that I thought I could drive through but it turned out to be a parking space, not someplace that I could go through. I had to try to back up and find a different place to drive through. There was so little room. It was very tight and I was concerned about being able to back out without hitting someone else's car. Some people were talking about what I needed or what I was trying to do and trying to give me some direction. Whatever they told me didn't work or wasn't going to work. Now I'm with Jennifer K related to spiritual direction, still in St. Joe."
"1360"	"(2006-07-23)"	"I have all that I need. Initially there is no image. I am communicating with someone, though I don't know who or how. I mentally recognize that there are four things that I need to complete something. Whoever I am communicating with is trying to get me to see that I have what I need - that I have those four things that I need. Three of them I pretty quickly get that I have those. The fourth one I seem to be struggling with, understanding or seeing or believing that I have it. These four things aren't objects, nor do they seem to be skills or knowledge. What comes to mind is what I consider to be the four elements of wellness - mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. There is a sense of calm and confidence. Matthew and I are going to a fair at VE. He is driving. We come to a place in the road where three roads form a triangle. We are at one point of this triangle, so we could go right or left. Where we need to be is on the road that is running horizontal in front of us. That is where the entrance to the fairgrounds is, directly in front of us. For some reason Matthew just cuts across the triangle instead of taking the road to the right or left and then connecting to the other. He makes a comment about now being able to see why more people don't come here, because the entrance is (difficult, or hard, or dangerous or...). There is a few inch drop-off on both sides of the road. As he cuts across I see the one, but I don't think it's that bad. He is just inching forward as though he feels it is much worse than I think it is. I'm getting concerned that it is taking him so long to cross the road because we are now in a position that if a car came from either direction and was either driving too fast or simply not paying attention they would broadside us. I'm getting very nervous and anxious. I want him to just hurry and get off of this road. I wonder why he is taking so long and being so slow about it. Then I notice that the drop-off on the other side of the road is more significant and you can't actually see how significant until you get almost on top of it. That's the entrance part of the fairgrounds. It isn't a paved road that we are pulling onto from the road. It is just dirt and sparse gravel. That's part of the reason for the significant drop. There is also a quite a dip in the fairground road that we're pulling onto. If it were raining we wouldn't have noticed that dip because it would be filled with water and the water would mask the depth. As soon as we enter we're facing a fork in the road. He chooses to take the right fork. I immediately tell him that I don't think that is the way most people enter the fairgrounds because we seem to be in a livestock area. There are barns, hay bales, a few animals, livestock trailers, and not many people. I have an image of a breaker box on a wall, like the type of box that holds the electrical breakers in your house. On the right side of the box there appear to be two keys inserted. One near the top and one near the bottom. The part of the key that goes into the box seems to be typical in size and appearance, but the head of the key appears to be about an inch and half square, noticeably larger than the head of a normal key, and/or there is something that size attached to the key. There is a similar key inserted on the left side of the box, also near the top. The one that fits into the left side near the bottom is not there. It is either missing, or I have it and don't realize it, or I have it and just haven't put it in yet. "

"1363"	"(2006-07-27)"	"I was at Mary Cu's house. She had asked me to go to there letting me believe I was going for one reason when that wasn't the case at all. Shortly after I arrived I realized she had invited me to introduce me to a cosmetic business she was involved in. She was hoping I would work for her. It had to do with selling cosmetics in homes. I wasn't even remotely interested in such a thing and was upset that she had misled me. Other women were arriving for the same reason. Someone close to Mary Cu, a female relative perhaps, was pointing out how Mary Cu had set up and decorated several rooms of her house to use for this business. They were done in pastel colors and very lacy and girlie looking. Each room had a specific purpose. She asked me if I agreed that they all looked very nice. I said yes they do. Mary Cu was going to show me around the rest of her house. As we were walking up a staircase I noticed there was another staircase to my right that almost didn't look real. It was very long and had several curves to it. It almost seemed to extend out into a vast space in the home without connecting to anything. Then I noticed beyond the top if it there were other staircases. I couldn't see where any of them started or ended. They were very colorful. I didn't want to use any of them because I was afraid I would get lost and not be able to find my way back. I was walking back to the main part of the house by myself. The rooms looked like they were something out of a high-tech movie. There was nothing in them. All I see is one wall of each room at a time. The walls are each a different color, very vivid colors like fuchsia, teal, and such. There also appears to be some kind of geometric pattern on each one, yet the color itself gives the appearance of something like a starburst, with the colors fading in circular pattern towards the outer edges of the wall. The walls kept moving in front of and behind me as if they were guiding me in a certain direction. There was always only one way for me to go. There were no doors. There was always just one opening created by a moving wall. Sometimes when the walls moved the opened to a scene of animals. At times the animals were real and off in a distance. One was a bunch of tigers or similar animals, lined up and all looking directly at me. Another time the wall was a picture of the head of a tiger and the head was as large as the entire wall. I just wanted to get my coat and leave. I finally got to the coat closet to get my coat and Mary Cu was there. She handed me a coat that wasn't mine. I had been wearing a knee-length, white, rabbit fur coat. She made some comment about why she was giving me this other one - which was a multicolored, shorter, fur coat. I didn't like the looks of it at all. But I realized the other coat belonged to her also so I really couldn't say much. The outside of the front of the house had a semi-circular drive and there were numerous vehicles sitting there and people milling about. I had some kind of problem with my car. Connie B and Glenn B were there. I asked them to help me but they wouldn't. I was very bothered by the fact that they wouldn't help me. Someone pointed to a vehicle that Mary Cu said I could borrow. It was a bright royal blue, beat-up, old pick-up truck. It seemed to have some kind of decorative painting on it but it was very abstract and just in some places. One place seemed to be a huge, red, circular design near the front of the truck. It was partially on the passenger side and partially on the hood. I definitely didn't want to drive a truck, and especially not this one as it didn't look at all dependable. I put my hand on it and realized it was very light. I moved hand and saw that I could lift the body of the truck with one hand. I decided that certainly couldn't be good. Then I realized what I could do so I could take my own car home."

I was sitting at a table talking with a group of people and there are other people in the same room but not part of our group. Aaron S is sitting alone at a table working on something financial for SAID, seems that it is related to budget. My group is discussing what Aaron S is working on and someone says that they don't think he is the right person to be doing that, implying that he isn't qualified or won't do it as well as someone else might. It is something that SAID has alot of trouble finding someone qualified who will do it. I was sitting there thinking that I am qualified and could do it well but that I would not like doing it at all. So, I decided not to say anything. Someone else said that they could do it well though no one responded, implying that they didn't agree. Some others agreed that it was quite a challenging task rather than telling this woman that they didn't have faith in her ability to do it well. As we continued talking I had an idea about exhibit space at the next conference. I reached kind of behind me to my right and grabbed a paper napkin to write on. I jotted a note to myself so I wouldn't forget to mention it at the appropriate time and then slid it under something so the person I was going to talk to about it wouldn't see it. It was something about using individual smaller rooms for some of the exhibitors. The person I was going to talk to about it was sitting next to me and noticed what I was doing. I told her that I had something to discuss with her later and smiled as I slid the napkin under the other object. She smiled back. One or two other people made comments and I just smiled. We continued with the group discussion. "

We both seem genuinely happy to see each other, and he leans over to give me a hug. We talk briefly and then Dorothy S walks up. Again, we both seem genuinely happy to see each other and she bends over to hug me. Now we're at their house and we're talking about Tara S. She isn't there right now, but her husband is. He's quite a bit taller than Tony S with a medium build and dark hair. He's an average looking man. I say something to Tony S and Dorothy S about him seeming like a very nice man. They agreed that he is as he and Tony S left the house. It must have been Dorothy S who said to me that they are very pleased to have him as a son-in-law. They had both taken one of my tests and I was grading it. I thought I should double-check my grading to make sure that it was correct. They would certainly point it out to me if I had made a mistake. Tina S and Toni S are at the house but they are little girls. They are both toddlers and appear to be very close in age, which is not the case in waking life. When I got ready to leave, it was just the two little girls in the room where the door was. I told him that I needed to leave. There was something about making sure that they stayed in the house and didn't follow me outside when I left."

When we finished I asked her if I could look at the operations manual. She tells me where I can find it. When I go to get it I see an accordion file. In each of the pockets of the file there are one or more stenographer notebooks. I pull one out, open it up, and look at it. It is a notebook from 20 years ago. It has notes that I had written from the store visits. Each of the pockets represents one of the districts that I used to visit at work with. I can't believe that she still has those, that they are still there, that I found them. As I'm reading through some of them I realize that there are also personal notes in them. Even then I had the tendency to write personal notes into whatever notebook I had with me wherever I was or what ever I was doing. Then, when I would get home, I would go through my notes and copy the personal notes on to another document. I went to my supervisor and told her that I found these. I don't know if I intended to ask for or if I actually did ask her if I can have those notebooks. I couldn't imagine why they would still want them or need them after all these years. I didn't want to tell her that there was personal information in them."

Even though in waking life the infants were much too young to consume anything other than milk, in the dream I was feeding them something other than milk. After I'd finished feeding the one incident I decided that she was thirsty. I knew that she was being breast-fed so I took her to her mother. I told her mother or that I have had her but that now she's thirsty. The baby was slipping in and out of sleep. I thought she needed to be nursed."
"1369"	"(2006-08-03)"	"Something to do with a condo that I had lived in. I was having a discussion with Matthew and it seems that I was defending my decision for us to have lived there. I was talking about all of the things that were good about living there. It might be that I was thinking about moving back there. Someone had just bought a condo there and was doing some major remodeling. The image almost looks as though they are up in trees, almost as though they are tree houses. I don't know how better to describe it. The parking spaces were underneath them in something that looked similar to a carport. One of them had quite a few different levels. Each level only seem to be one or two feet tall yet, they were described as places where different things were sold and someone described it to me and I said, oh you mean like knickknacks for autos. They said yes. The outside of those levels looked like grass huts. Then there was something about working with information that had nothing to do with anything like paper 10 computer talking to people audios. But there were four categories of information. It was as though the categories were four points on a spectrum. One end was reasons why I should live there. The other end was reasons why I shouldn't live there. The two categories in the middle were some degree of the other two. At least, that's the best I can describe it. We did look at the inside of any of these. But we did seem to be looking at the outside of a number of them, but not for the purpose of buying one. It was more just out of interest or curiosity. As we were doing this, every time I would come up with a piece of information that fit in one of these categories I would go back to someplace and add this piece of information. It's as though I'm looking at a list of things that I've collected. I start reviewing it and I see that there are some duplicates. They are worded slightly differently though. So I would change the wording on one of them so it was very clear and so it also incorporated the other one and then I would get rid of the duplicate. I said something to someone about something making it very clear to me that I needed to gather this information as I came across it and put it all together in one place."
"1370"	"(2006-08-06)"	"I'm a patient in a hospital. I have a very large private room, large compared to waking life hospital private rooms. The door is on the wall facing the end of my bed slightly to my left. There is a large distance between the end of my bed and the door. I had either been asleep or I was just on the verge of falling asleep. A black man enters my room and heads straight towards me with the intention of harming me in some way. Just as he reaches the end of my bed, someone else enters the room and physically tackles him to the floor. Once these two people are out of my room I get out of my bed and go across the hall into another much larger room that has several beds in it. All of the bids had patients in them. I asked a nurse if I could sleep with one of the patients in that room that night. She was hesitant. But I pointed out that in one of the beds there is a very large poodle, dog, sleeping rather than a patient. There are several smaller dogs, I think they're puppies, also sleeping in that bed. The puppies aren't poodles. I tell her that that is the bed that I went to sleep in, so she agrees. I get in the bed and I am practically lying on top of the poodle. I am now a dog. I am telepathically communicating with this poodle. The poodle is not the mother of the puppies, yet she is nursing them. My initial communication with the poodle is about why I am there, why I wanted to sleep there. It feels safer or comforting. I don't know if I am communicating this to the poodle or if I am just thinking about how it feels to be laying there next to this big soft fluffy poodle. She is lying on her side with her paws stretched out to the side. She's very hungry. She never moves. Yet somehow she eats. As she does there is a liquid substance that comes out of her mouth. It is mostly clear but has white spots. This is an indication that something is wrong with her. I don't know if I actually say something to the nurse about this or if I'm just thinking about saying something to the nurse. This would indicate to me that I am now human. I'm having a conversation with this nurse about the 12 finalists from the last season of American Idol who were coming in to entertain patients at the hospital. There's something about having refreshments while they are there. The hospital staff is getting ready for their arrival. Just as they arrive we realize that there are no paper cups, paper plates, napkins, etc. I tell them that I have some that we can use and I think it's Taylor that says he will go with me to get them."

This item, the information, had four categories or sections. There was a square divided into four parts. Each of those parts had one of the four categories in them. It had something to do with assertive women. I use the word assertive though that wasn't the word used in the dream. I can't remember what it was but it was similar to assertive. There were several people who seemed to come in and out, though I didn't see them physically. I actually have no image of sitting in a room, at a desk, a computer or anything like that. I was communicating with other people occasionally about this topic. I was trying to identify the positive aspects of each of these elements. They are each typically seen in a negative light. Two words that come to mind to describe this are powerful and commitment. I can't recall if they were actually words used in the dream or if they were actually part of this topic I was working on. "

Even the yard had a confectionary appearance to it. Though, it didn't look like a Gingerbread house. It was different than that. It made me smile, and made me curious. I decided that when I got home I would do a search for candy house on the internet and see if I could find anything. Now I am with a family member and I ask them about the candy house. They told me that the family that owns it has regularly scheduled tours, which they took once. During the tours they explain the how and why of their candy house. I wanted to take the tour. Of course, it isn't really candy. They just used building materials that would make it appear as though it were. We drove by the house again. This time I noticed things that I hadn't noticed the first time. The house sat back a bit from the road and there was a long, curvy, brightly-colored driveway. It appeared to be wet, at least all the way down the middle, but then I realized that I what I originally thought was rain water was actually something else. Something negative happened after this."
"1373"	"(2006-08-13)"	"Bev and one or more of her children were spending the night at my house, though my house looked different than in waking life. Jody S and Jason S had come to the city where I live to go to the State Fair. It was much closer to my home than in waking life. Jason S wanted to watch a cannonball demonstration that was being held there. I was very concerned about the fact that this demonstration was being conducted and was telling Jason S this. I was especially opposed to it because it was so close to my home and I was concerned about the safety of my family members that were at my house while it was going on. As we were walking, I suddenly put my hand on his arm and stopped him, saying that I had just spotted a penny on the ground. When I bent down to pick it up I saw it was a quarter. Then I saw a 2nd quarter and then a nickel. Jason S had bent down as well and we kept finding more and more, mostly coins that were unusual and of higher value like one dollar coins. We were picking them all up and putting them in my pocket. Jason S was picking some of it up and handing it to me to put in my pockets. Since I was the one who spotted it he was going to let me keep it. I soon noticed a fence just a few feet in front of us and lined up along it on the ground were small piles of individual's personal belongings such as wallets. I realized that the people who were participating in the cannonball demonstration had emptied their pockets while they were participating in the event and had put everything from their pockets on the ground here along this fence. That's where the money we had found came from. It had just gotten kicked or somehow moved away from the fence. I began removing everything from my pockets and putting it in a pile close to the fence. Someone else said something to me about not needing to do this, but I said I wouldn't consider doing anything else now that I knew it wasn't just ""lost"" coins, like I would normally find on a sidewalk and such. The cannonball demonstration began. The people who were putting it on felt it was safe because they had a short row of targets that they were aiming at and because they had set up numerous rows of barricades leading from house. I wasn't convinced that someone wouldn't misfire or that a cannonball wouldn't go off course. Jason S made a slightly derogatory remark about a man involved with the demonstration, something about him not working. A woman said something to me about how upset this man was that someone had said such a thing, even though neither of them knew who said it. As she was telling me this I saw him sitting on the ground in a dark corner with his knees to his chest. He was sobbing because of what Jason S had said. I had suggested Jason S say something. I was pretty specific but can't remember now what I told him. But I also told him not to let anyone know that he is the one who made the original comment. Because the man was so upset I wasn't sure what he might do to Jason S if he found it that it was him who said it. We walked over to the barricades and I saw there were numerous gaps large enough for me to get through them to my house. I knew the people responsible for the event would be upset if I went through them, especially the man who had put them up and was already so upset. But I just wanted to get home. I had to bend over quite often to get through. There were numerous rows of different types of barricades, spread out into a fan shape. "

There were several downward spirals, as you might typically find leaving a parking garage except that there were much smaller in diameter and there were no walls or anything in the middle of the spiral. The traffic was very heavy and people seemed to be driving very fast. I was very nervous and concerned. Someone pointed out some mirrors that allowed you people to safely travel down the spirals at a high speed. I wasn't sure I trusted it but noticed several cars on it that seemed to be descending safely. At times, or in some way, it doesn't seem that I'm in a car at all but rather that I'm looking down at all of this. I see the spiral in-front of me but just slightly off-center to my left. These other roads seem to be below the spiral, coming from under the spiral out to my right. Now it feels as though I'm walking on a sidewalk alongside the straight roads, with a man, talking about these roads and other things related to the airport. A helicopter lands very nearby. He decides that he is going over to ask the pilot if he can have a ride. I don't want a ride but I walk over there with him. The pilot agrees to give him a ride. When he takes off I am on the outside with my arms and legs wrapped around something that resembles a square, plastic, milk crate. I am holding on tightly through one of the openings. The pilot is talking with someone on the radio who is telling him that he is not allowed to transport someone the way he is transporting me. The pilot tells the other person that it is that person's fault because they didn't do something they should have."
"1375"	"(2006-08-17)"	"There was a woman passenger in a helicopter that was being flown over the ocean. The pilot was a man. The helicopter exploded and I thought to myself, that's what they call pink mist. But then I noticed there were also pieces of things that were also falling into the ocean. None of them were more than a few inches in diameter, or however such pieces could be described. I wonder if any of the pieces are body parts that someone might find and be able to identify. Now the front part of the helicopter seems to be intact and floating near the surface of the ocean, with just a small part of it above the surface. I see the pilot's hand reach out the window as if hoping would see it and help. Now there is much more of this part of the helicopter above the surface. The woman passenger steps out as though she has just walked up a few steps to emerge from the wreckage. She is a tall, slender woman, wearing a black pencil skirt and white blouse. Her clothing seems totally unharmed. But her face is almost totally marred, badly marred. Then I notice that there is a 2 or 3 inch vertical strip on the left side of her face by her ear that seems perfectly fine, not hurt at all. She stands and leans her back against the cockpit, as if waiting for someone to come along and rescue her. She is now at what appears to be a social gathering with about 20 people. There is a lot of discussion about the accident. A few people say things, not necessarily bad things, about the pilot. Just the type of things people might say when discussing such an event. Several people approach her and tell her what an excellent pilot he was and how sure they are that he did everything he possibly could have to avoid the accident. I don't know that she believes any of them. I sense that she feels almost numb from the experience and doesn't know what to think. She seems to be leaning with her back against a wooden rail, like you might see surrounding a wooden deck on a home or building. I am on the other side of that railing with Macy F. She points out a man and tells me that his name is Charlie [unknown in waking life] and says something about him not being a nice man - at all. She says I would like him even less than someone else, but I don't remember now who the other person was that she was referring to. "
"1376"	"(2006-08-17)"	"I was at the CAS office. I noticed that they had done alot of rearranging of the two storage closets, although they didn't look like they did in waking life. The one closet had a glass window in one side of it. The closet light was on and I could see inside, which is how I noticed the change. The closet was 3 or 4 times longer than it was wide. Along the end furthest from me, one of the narrower sections, there were shelves three shelves, spaced evenly up the wall. The only thing on the shelves were several different kinds of disposable diapers for babies. I realized that they were left from when Kara C was a baby. At first I was surprised that there were so many different kinds but then realized that they had probably tried different brands until the decided on the one that they liked best. Kara C is probably a teenager now, or close to it. I wondered why they don't just get rid of them. There would certainly be plenty of charities that could make very good use of them. But I realized that would certainly be uncharacteristic of them. "
"1377"	"(2006-08-17)"	"I am at a family gathering with my mother's side of the family. It was at someone's home, though I'm not sure whose it was. It doesn't seem to be the annual reunion but I don't know why the gathering is being held. I'm inside talking to someone about some clay flowerpots and saucers. There is one that is about 7 or 8 inches in diameter. Someone is telling me that they got the flowerpot and the saucer for 1 cent each. I went through a door from the house into the garage. Just inside the garage to my right there was a set of shelves that was about 3 and a half feet high. There were some old, dirty clay flowerpots and saucers sitting on the top shelf. One or more of them are broken. There is a step leading from the house down into the garage. I am standing on that step when Larry K and Sue K arrive. We talk briefly about flowerpots. They say something about a good deal they found on some they recently bought, then Sue K goes inside. I point to one sitting on the top shelf and tell Larry he won't believe the deal I just got. I tell him that I just got one about that size for a penny. Maybe I said I got it for one cent because the person who actually did that had gotten it for me. I tell him that the one I got was a bit larger than the one I'm pointing to, and obviously not broken."
"1378"	"(2006-08-19)"	"I went to a parish council meeting. It was being held in a very large open room like ones typically used for large social events. There was something else going on in the same room, maybe more than one thing. I spotted the council members and walked over to sit down. They had set up chairs in a U-shape, with 2 or 3 rows in each part of the U. It was almost time to start and there were several other members who were just arriving. There weren't many chairs left so we were each trying to find a place to sit. With everything else going on in this room it seemed very hectic and loud. I was standing at one corner of the U and noticed an empty chair on the end of the other side so I walked around to take that seat. I leaned over and asked the person next to the empty seat if it was available and he nodded yes. In waking life there aren't this many council members and we always meet in small meeting rooms. I was co-chairing a committee and someone told me that my co-chair was not going to be at the meeting to help me with the presentation that she and I were scheduled to do together. I was bothered by this only momentarily. I had the handouts that we had intended to use as an outline to speak from so I knew I could use that and do the entire presentation myself in her absence. I had created PowerPoint slides to make the handout and attached them together in a report cover. It was the type of cover that businesses used to use to store computer reports when computers first came out and used the perforated, wheel-feed paper that had rows of holes on each side. The front and back of the report holder was a somewhat flexible, colored, coated cardboard. One end of each piece was folded in about an inch and had a metal clips. One of the metal clips had a round, plastic ""tie"" that went through the holes of the computer paper and then into the other metal clip to fasten the other cover the report to it. The ends of the tie were then folded down and to other metal bars were slid over them to hold them in place. But this one was the size of a standard letter mailing envelope. The cover was burgundy in color. I was sitting there flipping through the pages and Roger B was now sitting to my right. He leaned over towards me and told me that he liked these types of handouts, that he thinks they are very helpful. I nodded yes, indicating that I agreed with him. He was now flipping through it himself. He gets to one page where I have taped the PowerPoint onto the page, which now appears to be the same as the report cover. It had something printed on it in black font. I had attached the paper with a piece of tape just at the top so I could easily lift it up to read the text underneath it on the page that appeared to be like the report cover. It was a somewhat familiar quote, but one that I felt was a valuable and appropriate reminder for the point I would be discussing with this page. Roger lifted the paper and read what was under it. He pointed to the quote and by the way he nodded his head and the expression on his face he indicated how much he agreed with it. I had gotten up to go somewhere and walked around the end of the U and was heading away from the group of council members. I heard several people simultaneously calling someone in a loud whisper, as though they needed to get this person's attention but they didn't want to be disruptive. At first I ignored them but it was persistent and they seemed to be trying harder and harder to get the person's attention. I finally turned around out of curiosity. It was then that I realized it was me they were calling, but they were calling me by my first name which very few people do. I didn't think they even knew my first name. So I walked back over and leaned over to one of them to find out why they were calling me. I said something to them about using my first name rather than the name I go by. The person I was talking to said she had sent me several lengthy emails and didn't get a response from me. I told her that I hadn't received them. She said she had suspected that was the case. As we talked more, or I may have walked away and come back. Somehow I realized that even though she was correctly sending them to me they were somehow going to a mutual acquaintance with the same first name. We both found it very odd that would happen, as we didn't know how it would be possible. In another part of the room there are some JLI members working on something. I overheard what they were talking about and was thinking that what they were saying was either incorrect or based on them not knowing something that I knew, which may have included the fact that I used to work for their organization. "
"1379"	"(2006-08-21)"	"I was at a large event where I knew many people. I was overseeing a table where I had people working and collecting money for something. There were a few times when I had gotten a bit aggravated by things a few of them had done. One thing was that they were allowing too much money too accumulate without having someone remove some of it to a safer location. I went over once and removed a stack of bills that was at least two inches high. I had taken most of the bills to put in a safe place but first just went to a different table to count it. Someone walked up and needed to talk to me away from there for a minute so I asked someone to watch the money for me, even though I was very uncomfortable with doing that. It was a man I was dating who wanted to talk to me. I knew he was aggravated at the moment because he felt I was spending time working when he felt I should be with him and his extended family. We went into a hotel sleeping room where his parents, a sister, and one or two other family members were gathered. They were discussing when they were going to have their family Christmas gathering, trying to find a date when everyone was available. While they were discussing dates they were also doing a name exchange for gifts. They had put the names in something that looked like a gift tin. It was about twelve inches in diameter but had something decorative on top. The thing on top was almost like a pillow, though not very thick. It was very girly. I was sitting cross-legged on the floor next to my boyfriend. He might have been my fianc_. They wanted me to draw a name from the can first. Someone brought it to me and lifted one side of the lid off just far enough for me to put my hand in a draw a name. I reached as far into the middle of the can as I could. The things inside didn't feel just like paper. So I was feeling the different things inside to use how they felt to decide which one to pick. As they continued to talk about dates I could tell they were frustrated with me, so was my boyfriend, because my schedule seemed to be the hardest one to find a time that would work. I felt bad but there were certain things that I felt I couldn't work around. I was struggling with choosing between family and business. I really felt that I needed to get back out to the tables but didn't want to upset this family further by telling them that or by leaving until they were ready for me to leave. There were two other women who were interested in my boyfriend and had been flirting with him and hoping to get him away from me. I was feeling threatened and unsure as to whether I could trust him. I worried that he really was doing something with these other women. I was concerned that he was going to leave me for one of them. I thought they were much more attractive than me so why wouldn't he rather be with them. And, they weren't torn between him and other commitments. I went into a bathroom and one of those women was there. She was trying to convince me that he was leaving me for her. She was tall, thin, and had long, beautiful, black hair. He came in and didn't want me to believe her. I saw a tall can of deodorant sitting there. I don't know if it was because of something I noticed or because of something she said, but I wondered if it belonged to this woman and my boyfriend. I finally asked him, though it might have just been an inquisitive look that I gave him. He finally admitted it."

"1381"	"(2006-08-24)"	"I was an medical intern, one of a small team of interns. There were learning exercises that we were to complete as a group, though we each had to figure out the solution ourselves. I was becoming increasingly frustrated because I was having trouble doing so. Part of my frustration is that I am usually the first one to get the answer but this particular time I was the last. I kept trying and not getting it. I was getting so frustrated. I could tell the others were watching me, almost with pity. I hated that. I never did figure it out."
"1382"	"(2006-08-25)"	"I was in my home, though it doesn't look like it does in waking life. I was looking out the patio door. There was a large flowerpot sitting on the deck. It was filled with dirt but there were no flowers growing in it. I noticed that Matthew had put four brownies on it and there was a squirrel sitting on it picking pieces off of one of the brownies and eating them. There another woman in the house at the time, not a relative. She said something to me about this. I said that I should tell Matthew that when he does something like that he needs to take them much further out into the yard so it doesn't attract the squirrels to my flowers. I was concerned that after the brownies were gone they would come back to the same spot and dig for my flower bulbs and eat them because I know squirrels naturally do that. This woman and I brought the brownies back into the house and were eating them ourselves. We are talking to someone else, another woman, maybe more than one person, about some things that are being done to the house. This third woman had requested that an awning be installed over the patio doors, but on the inside. She thought it would be a cool decorative look. I didn't like the sounds of it at all but didn't say anything because I didn't want to seem uncooperative or negative. It was going to be made out of blue and white stripped fabric and it would be the width of the patio doors. The patio doors seem to be off a family room and the family room area seems to be at a higher elevation than the rest of that room or area. It's fairly small, with room for only 2 or 3 chairs. There are now 3 other women, who live on our street, in the family room area with myself and the first woman. Two of them are sitting on the step that leads up to the family room. One of them is sitting in a chair to my right facing the other two and the fifth is standing near the patio door. We're talking about various things. I'm thinking about how great it is to finally have women friends from my neighborhood again. We must have decided to go out to eat because we are going to have dessert but decide to share it. One of the women gets up and goes to a counter very close to our table to get silverware. As she is getting it I tell her we need 4 forks and 1 of something else. She says something jokingly and everyone smiles. Apparently she hadn't gotten enough and had gotten one of the wrong thing but had already gotten it before I had finished my sentence. She went back and got what I had told her we needed. When she came back I realized that we actually needed five forks. Rather than admit my mistake I just decided to tell the others I didn't want any. But then I realized that I had a fork on the table in front of me and I could just use it. "

"1384"	"(2006-08-27)"	"Matthew had gotten some mice as pets. They were brownish-grey in color. I was helping him with them. There were several wire cages that had things that were tube-shaped and no bigger in diameter than the mice themselves. The mice could enter the cages through this tube and they could get back out either through the same or similar tubes. I was doing something to the tubes, though I don't know what or why. I was sitting on the floor and frequently picking a mouse up from one area of the carpet and placing it near a cage. I said something to Matthew about how odd it was that I was willing to sit there with these mice and that I was even willing to handle them. As I was sitting there watching them, I noticed that there were 6 or 7. I thought there were more than that originally, that one or more of the mice were now missing. He had bought them at 2 or 3 different times, and each time purchased the same number. We were discussing how many he bought each time so we could try to figure out how many were actually missing. I didn't know how long they had been missing and was imagining their little bodies lying dead somewhere."

I finally started to say something about our last session, and he interrupted me and said essentially not to say anything, that there was no point in discussing it. I asked him why. I can't remember the words that he used, but he was implying that I either couldn't understand or grasp the concept of just deciding to be happy, or that I didn't agree with it, or that I simply could not or would not do it. I quickly told him that I do understand and grasp the concept. I also agree that it is possible to do that, that a person can simply decide to be happy and then they will be happy. I had intended to also say that I believe I understand more than a lot of people just how much our thoughts can impact our reality, that our thoughts can create a reality."

He is slightly taller than I am, small bit old, brown hair, wearing thin round dark-rimmed glasses, and has a very short neatly trimmed beard. He has a clipboard and on it there's a piece of paper that has a large grid that covers the entire sheet. There are perhaps 20 blocks to the grid, for a cross and five down. Most of the squares on the grid have numbers in them. Others have nothing in them. So he's talking to me and as he's talking he is using a pen to point to these various blocks on this grid as he talks. There are a couple that have numbers and a couple that have nothing but as he's talking he circles them several times very dramatically as he speaks. I stopped him and asked him what he means."

I am also working part time there and told her that I didn't realize that we were allowed to work out during our shift. She said that we are allowed to we just have to make sure that we keep our jobs or priority. So if there is something that we need to be doing for our job we need to do it rather than working out. However, if we get a break or don't have anything to do that we can't work out. I also have some things I guess in my locker at the YMCA that I've been hanging on to. They belong to someone who is no longer in my life or are somehow connected to that person. It almost feels as though this person has died. Someone told me that it's not healthy for me to continue to hold onto these things. They said I needed to get rid of them and let go. I said something to my friend about it because I thought she would agree with me and be supportive, but she wasn't. She agreed with the other person."

As we entered the building I headed to the left and everyone else kept going straight. Someone told me I was headed the wrong direction. They said I need keep going straight. There was as woman sitting at a table. We had to sign something to be able to pick up our children. The thing that she had for us to sign was a line-notepad that was approximately 3 x 5 inches. The pad was attached to a holder that was made of blue plastic and shaped somewhat like an isosceles triangle. She had all of our names listed on it and we just had to sign by our printed name."

Some are sitting on chairs and others of us are standing, some standing by the rail surrounding the porch. They are several steps leading up to the porch. Someone comes up to the bottom of the steps and asks us about someone, though I'm not sure now if they were asking about an individual, a couple, or a family. Whoever it is that they're asking about has something that clinically might be considered a personality disorder. Someone immediately replies that there is no one around like that. Someone else then points to the house next door to our left as we're facing away from the house and tells us to take a look at what is going on over there. It had been sitting empty, but now there are families, but maybe just one family, staying in that house. They don't own the house nor did they receive permission from the owner to be there. They just showed up, found a way to get in and then just began living there. Apparently this behavior is very typical of someone with the type of personality disorder that was asked. So the person who pointed this out to us then said, see, there are a lot more of those people around than you realize. He said most people just don't pay attention to notice it."

So, for example, there were six that I called Magic so I named them magic 1, magic 2, etc. This particular poster board was somehow related to the famous Australian crocodile hunter that died recently and has been in the news so much. His wife and his dad were talking about a good name for this poster board and they came up with the name magic because they said, quite simply, that is what he was. He was simply pure magic. I was quite moved by their admiration for him.

"1399"	"(2006-09-06)"	"I was at a social event, but I don't know what it is or where. The event is nearly over so some of us begin helping with cleanup. There is a lot of stuff sitting on some of the tables. A lot of it is partially eaten food that people have sat down or let sit and some of it not even on plates or napkins. Somebody had set a partially eaten piece of chocolate cake down on the tablecloth. They were plastic tablecloths but I still thought it was pretty bad manners. There were two rectangular tables sitting end-to-end but not touching. I was clearing off one of them when I noticed on the one to my right there was a rectangular sheet cake tray. It was gold and looks like the one I have. Some of the cake was left. I noticed from the corner of my eye that a man walked up, picked up a white plastic knife and cut a very thin piece of the cake for himself. Then he used the knife to put it in his mouth and places the knife right back on the tray by the cake for others to use. He comes back a couple of times and does the same thing. It's bothering me because I think it's very unsanitary. I don't think he could have done that without the knife coming into contact with his tongue or lips. I finally say something to somebody who is helping with cleanup. They don't think it's a big deal because they think he could have done it without the knife touching his tongue or lips. The next time he comes back and does it again this other person I was talking to watches him and sees that the knife does in fact touch his tongue or lips. At any rate he just keeps coming back and doing this until the cake is gone. When he started doing this there was nearly half of a sheet cake there. At first I don't pay attention to even look and see who he is. As he is coming back for the final piece of cake I'm standing at the other side of the table so I'm face-to-face with him this time. Then I realize that I know him I tell the other person that I'm working with that I know this man. Just as I finish saying this he gets to the table and reaches for the last piece of cake. I debate whether or not I should say hello because he doesn't seem to recognize me. I finally decide that I should at least say hello. I extend my hand and as I do I say my name to make it easier for him to act as though he remembers me. He reaches out and shakes my hand and just nods his head at me as if to say, oh yes I remember you. At the same time he is turning his head to the right to listen to a child that is talking to him. But he doesn't actually say anything. I am now sitting behind the same table and he sits down across from me. I was as bit offended by the way he reacted because I thought it was quite cold but I also interpreted his response, or lack of, to mean that he had a negative opinion of me for some reason. Now, several of my family members are helping to clean up. There is one large open cardboard box that has a number of different things in it and sticking out the top that look like it's a box of trash. I see fairly a large Christmas decoration in it and think that surely BJ did not intend to throw that away. I meant to ask her but for some reason kept putting it off. The third time I looked at it I realized that it's broken and that's why she is throwing it away. As I continue cleaning up I see that she is throwing away two or three other Christmas decorations. I notice that each one has some part of it that has something to do with water. Like, they have tubes on them that water runs through. I don't know how better to explain that. It seems very odd for Christmas decorations to have anything like that. They were the kind of decorations that you would display outdoors or hang on a wall or sit on a table. Kim H is working closest to where I am but Jody S is there also. BJ and her daughters and I are all now sitting in the living room, most of us sitting on the floor. I have no idea whose home we're in because we're all getting ready to leave there to go home. We're discussing taking care of or raising children. I think Jody S's twins prompted this conversation. I'm noticing how tired Jody S looks."

While I am in the writing class something happened to cause a disruption to the entire class. Everyone was involved in it. Once it was over we realized there was only a few minutes left in class and we still had a writing assignment to complete before leaving. I don't know if it was just a few paragraphs or what exactly. The instructor said we could not leave until we did it and turned it in to her. For some reason, I was involved in this disruption longer than the others. The bell rang indicating that class was over but I had still not started my writing assignment. The instructor was still being insistent on my writing it and turning it in to her before I left. I sat down and was trying to write very quickly. Even so, I was late for my next class. I was in the hall and looking through the door windows of the various classrooms trying to figure out which one I was supposed to be in. Once or twice I opened a door thinking that it was the right room and as soon as opened the door I saw that it wasn't the right room after all. The people in the room towards the door as they heard it open. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed, quickly closing the door and moving on. I finally did find the right room. I entered the room and mouthed an apology to the instructor. They were watching a video. I had to walk across the front of the room to get to the only empty seat. I bent over to try to avoid blocking the video but was unsuccessful in that effort, even though it was only for a second or two. The instructor didn't seem any too pleased by the disruption. For the art class, I don't think that I was actually late, but I may have just been the last one into the classroom. The instructor approached me and explained the assignment. The best way I can describe it is that we were duplicating some images that looked like Chinese text. There were a number of jars of paint that were placed in a vertical holder of some kind with two columns and two jars in each row. The entire thing, even the jars of paint looked white, yet each jar of paint was a different color, with one being black. Though it too looked white. The angled paint brush reminds me of a calligraphy pen. I duplicated my first symbol and the instructor said something to me about how good it was. She seemed surprised by how good it looked and how it seemed so easy for me. With just two strokes I had duplicated this image almost perfectly. She asked me how that was possible. I told her that it appears to me that there are very faint lines in the image. They aren't readily noticeable but if you look closely at the image you can detect them. I said that it seemed to me that they were probably created by the brush. This made me realize that if I held the brush with the bristles at the correct angle to the paper I could easily achieve the same look, creating the lines going in the same direction. That's what I did and it seems to have worked. I went ahead and finished the assignment. Some of the paint jars were empty so I substituted other colors for the ones I was actually supposed to be using. The instructor wasn't very happy that my colors were incorrect and asked me why they weren't. I told her it was because some of the paint jars were empty. She asked me why I didn't just say something about the jars being empty. I don't know that I had an answer for her or if I was even thinking to myself why I hadn't. To not say anything would be typical for me as I wouldn't want it to seem as though I was complaining, criticizing or being difficult in any way. I tend to make the best of what I have and not want to bother anyone. I think the art instructor has a teaching assistant. She asked the assistant to replace the empty jars of empty but it turned out that they didn't have any more jars of this color to replace the empty ones with. This made me feel better about not having said anything about them being empty, since now I know they couldn't have done anything about it anyway. As it is time for class to be over the instructor is telling me specifically because the other students apparently already know this, but she is telling me because I am new there that our next class is going to be held in a different location. She wants to make sure that I know where it is and that I don't have trouble finding it. She tells me but I'm not familiar with it. I've not heard of it before. I tell her I'm sure I can find it if she just gives me directions and I will be there on time. For some reason I think it is some place that I need to drive to. She decides to walk me over there to be sure I know where it is. When we arrive she is talking to someone who oversees this particular facility. It turns out that we are not going to be able to have our class there so I'm glad that we have walked over there together. Otherwise I might have shown up and no one be there and I wouldn't have known what to do or where to go next. Sometime during all of this, maybe this is what was happening during the writing class, a student was leaned way out an open window. It's raining outside. We find out that he is trying to rescue a very small dog. The dog might be twelve inches tall, if that. It's a mature dog but nonetheless very small body. I think it has white fur but maybe is so dirty that it looks more grey. The student finally gets the dog, lifts it inside the classroom, and sets it on the floor. The dog walks around the room, not slowly but not running either. I can tell that it is trying to shake the water out of its fur the way a dog would normally do but seems unable to do that. I say something about this to the instructor who is also observing the dog try to do this. We realize that it has some physical problem that is preventing it from being able to do that. I think to myself that this is kind of like me when something happens to me and I can't seem to shake it. I am following two or three instructors down a hallway. Both walls of the hallway have banks of lockers lining the wall. They have padlocks hanging on them. As we're walking at least one of the instructors occasionally reaches out to her left and does something with some of the padlocks. I don't know if she is just testing to see if they are locked or if she is moving them so they hand straight or maybe she is turning the way they are hanging so the numbers are facing the front. There was also something about parking or a parking lot(s). "
"1401"	"(2006-09-10)"	"The location is California, right along the coastline. I don't know the people involved and I wasn't involved nor do I have any sense of being present or observing until the very end. Something is happening with the ocean. It is just hours or less away from beginning to put the land completely underwater a little bit at a time. I say a little bit meaning less than a mile at a time. One man realizes what is going on and is trying to tell an authority figure so he can warn the people who live there and give them instructions so they can save themselves and their families. He is convinced this is going to happen at such a rapid pace that people need to be warned immediately so they can leave immediately to one of the more central states. Though, he isn't sure just how far in they will have to go to remain safe. The man he is trying to tell won't believe him so he won't do anything. I'm wondering if people from my home state will be safe since they are so far from an ocean. The man decided that the safest thing for he and his family, he had just one child at the time, would be to live on a boat that he believed would remain above water regardless. Just as the man expected, parts of the shoreline begin to disappear under the ocean, along with everyone who had been living there. It is now years later and the man and his family are still living on the boat with no sign of land anywhere. They have begun to wonder if there is land anywhere anymore, or any other people left on earth. They realize that if they are it will mean the end of the human race since their children will not be able to procreate. He and his wife now have four children. They have raised them all on this boat. The older two are a boy and a girl, now close to being teenagers or in their early teens. They are arguing about something and finally tell the younger two that they need to talk to the parents alone. The younger two go below to the cabin of the boat while the older two talk with the parents. They spot land very near and are very soon docking their boat. Just off the dock is a huge building. It reminds me of a very stately, old, stone building. It has steps that run the entire width of the front of the building with occasional very, large, round pillars supporting an overhang. The building is perhaps 3 stories tall. The land and building seem completely unharmed. Then they see that there are people there. They don't know what this place is so they cautiously approach and enter the building. There are many people there, not all related. Perhaps it's a hotel of some sort, though not like any I've ever seen in waking life. On the inside of the building, the outer walls are lined with rooms. A few feet from the doorways of the individual rooms there is something to create a division, maybe more pillars but smaller in diameter and not quite as tall, between the small rooms and the immense open area that makes up the rest of the floor. The floor itself was a beautiful stone, perhaps marble. From where they stand they can see up to the 3rd floor. The center of the building is open all the way up to the roof, and the outer walls are lined with individual rooms on each floor. They see people walking about on each floor, tending to their day as if nothing had happened. There is no sense as to whether they even know what has happened. A small-stature, middle-aged woman with graying blonde hair approaches them and greets them with a warm smile and welcoming words. She has very kind eyes. While she may not know what has happened she can tell they are in need of a safe and comfortable place to stay, someone where they can feel cared for. She invites them to stay, and says they will have the third floor to themselves for as long as they need. As they enter the third floor it now looks different in that the center area is no longer open to the lower two floors. It has the appearance of a well-appointed, plush perhaps, old world residence. The family is torn in their feelings, as it would feel so incredibly good to be enveloped in such luxury after the experience of their recent years, yet they also feel uncomfortable at accepting such a gift, perhaps feeling undeserving or out of place. There is a staff of people who work there and care for the physical surroundings. Some of them also help to care for some of the people there. They will be caring for this family any way possible. I am now in the dream and talking to a woman on the staff. I'm telling her how much pain I've been experiencing in my right hand and I wished I had someone who could or would massage it. I tell her that I know it wouldn't help much but that it might at least provide a little relief. She immediately walks away and returns with some things in her hand and tells me that she is going to massage my hand. I hesitate but quickly realize that it's useless for me to protest so I just submit. She has some kind of special gel and a plastic glove that she places on my hand and begins to massage it. I can't believe how good it feels. She addresses each of my fingers, one by one, and with each one I feel a dramatic release of the pain. The middle-aged woman walks up and I explain why the woman is massaging my hand and tell her just how much it is helping. The look on her face tells me she doesn't really believe that it is helping that much or that it feels that good. The woman finishes with my hand and I convince the middle-aged woman to allow her hand to be massaged in the same way. She very quickly realizes that I was not exaggerating at all. "
"1402"	"(2006-09-11)"	"A getaway to the mountains. Some of the group are going out to go skiing and snowboarding. Matthew is one that is going out. Some who knows the area, maybe someone who works at the facility, says it is extremely cold out and they need to dress in three layers. They did this but Matthew isn't too happy about it because he doesn't think he'll need it. I told him that he can always take a layer off when he's out there if he doesn't think he needs it and then he'll have it if he changes his mind and wants the third layer on. I'm talking to several people about my job search. Some members of my family, including Bob F and Bev, are sitting at a very large, round table. There are papers everywhere on it, some of them in piles that are three or four inches high. There are papers and pocket folders related to job search among the papers on the table. I tell them one in particular that I'm looking for and they begin ruffling through to find it for me. Someone pulls one out and someone else tells them that isn't the right one. Then someone else finds the right one. There are two people, one male and one female, there from companies that I have applied to. I find out that one of the companies is not what they said they were and I realized immediately that it was a company that I would not work for. They are both very wearing very strange things on their heads, each different. They aren't hats really, but they are wearing them as though they are. The thing on the man's head can best be described as looking like a type of bird house but it has little things attached to the outside of it. One of the things is like a tiny propeller that is spinning very rapidly. I'm going to be giving a talk about dreams. The room is very deep and not very wide. A woman comes in asks about something I might need. I ask her how many people she is expecting to attend and she replies that it could be anywhere from 25 to 100. I tell her that if there are 100, with the room shaped as it is, I will definitely need whatever it is that she asked me about for the sake of the people in the back. I said it would be too hard to try to get so many people to fill all the front seats so everyone is as close to the front as possible. Maybe it was a microphone, but it might have been something that would allow the people in the back to see better. I looked at my watch and it was about 18 minutes before the hour so I knew I had about fifteen minutes more before I needed to begin. I don't know what hour. A man taking care of AV needs was standing in the middle back of the room behind an AV equipment cart. A woman came in and set up refreshments on a table along side him. Mostly they were huge cookies, about the size of a dinner plate. I looked over at the AV man and he lifted a plate of cookies off the table and motioned to me that we could not allow the guests to have those. I walked over and saw that plate was chocolate chip cookies. I was so hungry because I had missed a meal so I took one and walked back to where I was preparing. Because the cookie was so large I folded it in half. Then I broke a piece off and put it in my mouth. I looked at my watch again and I thought it said the same thing that it said earlier. I became concerned that my watch had stopped and that I didn't have much time left. I looked up at the wall to see if there was a wall clock. There was and it said two minutes past the hour. Now I was panicked because I wasn't ready. Just as I realized this a spotlight of sorts had been turned on at the front of the room and there is a woman there beginning to introduce me. I quickly grabbed a pile of materials, sat my cookie on top of it and hurried to the front of the room while she continues with the introduction. I put the pile of materials on an AV cart that I will be using for my presentation. The woman says something to me as she notices me fumbling about. I told her I just need to pull out some of the materials and the ones I need first aren't on the top of the pile. I said something about having the cookie there because I had missed my meal. We hear a marching band outside. I smile and begin acting as though I'm marching. I comment how much I love marching bands and how great this one sounds. It's the PLU marching band."
"1403"	"(2006-09-12)"	"I'm on a bus headed home from somewhere. There are a lot of people on here that I went to high school with. Tony S and Dorothy S and their girls are on the bus as well. I'm sitting in the very first seat. I think in the bus are bench seats but none of them have backs on them. I was thinking that I would get home faster if I was driving myself. So I was watching for a particular exit because I knew that from this particular exit I would also be comfortable driving myself home. It was starting to get dark outside. Jeff L came up and sat down next to me. It wasn't until then that I even realized that he was on the bus. I was so excited to see him. We both stood up and hugged and kissed each other on the cheek. We sat back down. He was sitting to my left. I was sitting on the right side of the bus right next to a window. He didn't sit right next to me though. There was enough space between us that another person could've sat there. He looked over at me and said, so you and Darren are still together? I nodded my head yes as I said yes, and then bit my lip to keep from crying. He noticed that something was wrong and said, uh oh. I just looked at him with a kind of sideways glance and he knew that we weren't going to stay together. He kind of nodded his head towards the back of the bus and pointed a finger towards the back but not where anyone could see it and said, no one else knows? I shook my head no. And then I said not even Darren. But I am so happy to see Jeff L that I don't want to have this kind of a conversation with him. At least not right now. I noticed on his ring finger that he wasn't wearing his wedding ring. There is a mark on his finger where he used to where it almost as though he was wearing a cheap ring and it tarnished and left a blackish green mark on his finger. I reached over and pointed to his hand and asked him where his wedding ring is. His jacket had been lying next to him on the seat and he picked it up and said it's in here indicating that it was in one of his jacket pockets. I said, well that's great that you and Gail H are still together. Though, even though he and Gail H dated for quite a few years I don't know if that is actually who he ended up marrying. He nodded yes. I think I said and you're still happy together that's really great. I asked him if they had any children but I don't remember if he responded. Something happened to the bus and we are now stopped at what looks like a rest area. We had been driving on the interstate. There are quite a few people standing around the bus including the bus driver. There's quite a bit of traffic going by very close to where everyone is standing. It turns out that the problem is something with one of the headlights. Somebody is telling us that it is going to take quite a while to get this headlight repaired. We can get back on the road until it gets repaired. I think we have to wait for someone to bring us a replacement headlight so they can replace it there before we get back on the road. We have to get it fixed before we can get back on the road because it's already fairly dark out. I was looking out the window again. When I realized where we were, I thought I could get home faster if I just walked. I said this to someone who was in charge of this event. She agreed with me and said that there were a number of other people who were saying the same thing. She said if any of us wanted to do that we wouldn't need to take our luggage with us, they would deliver it to our homes. I had four small, light weight items with me besides my luggage so I was going to carry those with me. I get off the bus and I set my things on the ground. Now it seems that I am with Dorothy S and she is unloading the back of her vehicle. The vehicle is either an SUV or a pickup truck. She is unloading her things and my things. The vehicle is pulled into a garage. But the main garage door is opened. I'm thinking that there is no way that she can walk home with all of the things that she has and I wouldn't be able to help her because she has things that are so big they are almost bigger than I am and they're so heavy I can hardly pick them up anyway. One of the things I can best describe as a very large fabric bundle. It is somewhat square and about three to four feet wide. It's also fairly thick, six or more inches at least. When she picked it up she also picked up a small red cooler at the same time. That was one of my things, one of the four things, that I decided to carry with me. It's empty so it doesn't weigh hardly anything. So I didn't think it would be a problem to carry home. Then the woman who is in charge of this event walks up and I point to the things that I'm going to carry with me and I tell her that I'm going to go ahead and walk home because that's all I have. They are lightweight so it will be no problem for me to carry them with me. I also have a pair of tennis shoes and a pair of socks sitting there with it. I'm sitting someplace else, and I may be having a conversation with someone. The woman had walked away and I am inside some building doing something. It begins to or down rain. I realize that my things are sitting outside and getting wet. At first I don't get up and go after them. But eventually I do because I especially don't want like tennis shoes and socks to get all wet because I want to be able to put them on to walk home. I don't have an umbrella but I'm still thinking about walking home even though it's pouring rain. When I went out to get them I saw that someone, I think it was this other woman, had set them inside the garage so they wouldn't get all wet."
"1404"	"(2006-09-16)"	"All of my dreams last night seemed to have been about my online store. It seems that I had a number of items that sold, but only parts of each one sold. I had all of these pieces left and I realized that I should have done the listings differently. As it was I was just combining these pieces and reselling them in a way that I now realize I should have done to begin with. I am feeling absolutely sure that now that I have learned my mistake that I will sell all of these without a problem."
"1405"	"(2006-09-17)"	"This was about Gary S. Something was going on and I knew I needed to contact him. I knew he would want me to let him know what was happening. The only way I had of contacting him was at his home. When I called there his wife answered the phone. The feelings are as strong as they were 20 years ago. The desire. The sadness. I can still feel the pain of our parting. Tears form in my eyes still. [Intense emotion. I'm having trouble focusing on recording the dream.] My mind keeps wanting to go back to that last month we spent together. That cold November so many years ago. I'm surprised that the memories, the remembering, the reliving in my mind can still evoke so much feeling. I once again find myself asking the question, is this how it feels to be in love? I don't even know that Gary S and I had enough in common to really have been able to make a long-term relationship work. But what we did have was good. So much better than good. I had never felt that way in a relationship before him and have never felt that way in a relationship since him. Maybe falling in love has nothing to do with commonalities. Maybe you don't necessarily fall in love with a soul mate. If there is such a thing as ""a love of your life"" it might not have anything to do with commonalities. [I'm having trouble distinguishing how much of this is from the dream and how much from being awake.] Certainly, my mind was all over the place with these kinds of thoughts when I knew I needed to call him and even while I was dialing the phone and waiting for him to come to the phone. When his wife answered the phone it was important that she not know how I knew Gary S. I didn't know if she would know who I was if I gave my name. I don't remember if I identified myself to her. If I did, I don't know how I did. I knew she was suspicious though, about this woman who was calling and asking to speak with her husband. It seems that I either gave a fictitious name or that I was vague at best in telling her who I was. At any rate he did come to the phone. He was definitely shocked when I told him that it was me. But there was also something in his voice that made me sure that he was glad to hear from me. Maybe I wasn't sure. Maybe I was just hearing what I wanted to hear. Maybe I just wanted him to be glad to hear from me."

I leave also, driving my car in following her to her house because I don't know how to get there from where we are. At one point we are driving along side each other carrying on a conversation yet it seems as though we're sitting next to each other. However, who were because she keeps turning to look at me when she is speaking to me she also is tending to move her steering wheel in that direction causing her car to get even closer to mine. I become very concerned that one of these times she's actually going to side swipe me. Because she's driving very close to me as it is. But I don't think she notices how close she is or what she's doing when she turns to talk to me. Doing this causes me to turn my steering wheel a bit to avoid her hitting me which causes me to run off the road a little bit several times. I finally say something to her and she gets back over in her own lane. But then she takes off and gets way ahead of me. At one point she just drives across some grass to get on the highway she wants to be on. I'm very uncomfortable with this, but feel like I have to do the same because I need to stay behind her or I won't know how to get to her house. I'm in her car with her and she pulls all to the side of the road at a place where there are numerous interchanges at one place. And she's trying to figure out how to get on the section of highway that she needs. We have seen someone driving very fast down one lane that appears to be a one way lane. There's a worn placed in the grass between us and where that lane is, that looks like a lot of people have used that to get over there. So she decides that's what she's going to do and that she's just going to do it very fast to try to avoid getting caught or causing an accident. It is dangerous. I ask her if I should go get in my own car and she agrees that that's a good idea. That way when I do get to her house I will be able to leave whenever I'm ready without needing to get a ride back to my car. There is a large Whiteboard hanging on a wall and someone has used a green marker and written on it. It's relative to this same dream. It seems to be directions. There are also two white metal chairs, the kind that mother and daddy have on their patio. They are sitting parallel to the Whiteboard."

When I walked into the hospital, the area that I was in had an escalator and was open to the second floor so I could see a lot of people in the open area of the second floor, some standing around the escalator. I immediately noticed Bill F standing facing the escalator and leaning on the half-wall next to it. One of my nieces or nephews was standing next to him. I went up the escalator and was surprised to see how many family members were there. My parents and all of my siblings were there as well as some of my nieces and nephews. Bruce W's mom was there as well as Aunt H and Aunt P. There was a fourth woman there that I referred to as one of their sisters but it wasn't my mother. The open area on the 2nd floor was fairly large. I went over and spoke with Bill F first and then some of my other immediate family. Then I went over and spoke with my aunts. They were all standing side-by-side in a row. I put my arms out and around the two on the end giving them a group hug. I noticed they were all wearing all black. At first I just thought it was odd then I became concerned that Bruce W was in a more serious condition than I realized."

"1412"	"(2006-10-01)"	"I had gone shopping. It was very early morning, still dark outside. First I was at a fabric store. It was a very expansive store with aisle after aisle of fabrics and the perimeters of the store were also lined with fabrics. The fabrics along the walls seemed to reach to the ceiling. There wasn't very much room to walk in the aisles, especially between the walls and the ends of the rows of fabrics. I was riding in something, maybe like the kind of scooter someone who couldn't walk well or far would use. I was having difficulty getting it around corners since the aisles were all so narrow. Someone offered to help once but I told her I was managing. Next I was at a store something like Linens N Things. I was buying several things. I went to pay for my things and the cashier, female, rang them up. One of the things I was buying was a box of dishes that was on sale for $35.96. The box was about 12 inches square and about 5 inches tall. When she gave me the total of my purchases it was a little more than $36 more than it should have been so I told her I thought she had accidentally rung up the dishes twice. She removed a set of dishes from the bill and then handed me a receipt. When I looked at it the dishes weren't on there at all. Then I realized that when she had rung them up they didn't ring up at the sale price. She called the manager to the front of the store. He was not a nice man at all, very rude. He was close to 6 feet tall with thick black hair. I would guess him to be in his mid to late 30's in age. He just looked down at me while I tried to explain what had happened he asked me how often I shop at their store. I was silent for a few seconds, completely surprised that he would ask that. Then I asked him if he was implying that he was only going to take care of this if I was a regular customer. He didn't say anything but I could tell that was the case by the look on his face. I was shocked. Without paying for my things or taking any of them I turned and started to walk out of the store. Just before I walked out the door I stopped, turned around to look at him, and said, I'm not a regular customer any more. Then I left walked out the door. I could tell by the look on his face that he really didn't care that he had just treated a customer like this. My behavior wasn't without room for improvement as I led him to believe that I had been a regular customer when in fact I wasn't. I tried to justify in my head what I had said by thinking that I could have become a regular customer if my first experience there had been better. It is still dark outside and I am walking to my car. There aren't that many cars in the lot because not too many people shop that early in the morning. Most of the cars are in one row, the outermost row for parking. I parked in this row, a little distance from the store, which is typical for me. The parking lot wasn't very well lit and I was having trouble seeing my car. I walked past it twice before I finally saw it. As I driving out I realized they had made changes in the layout of the parking lot to improve traffic flow when I found myself needing to get over to my right to exit the lot. There was a cement wall, or something similar, that was a few feet high, to my left. The change had apparently not been recent because there was nothing around that made it look as though construction was going on. There were quite a few cars exiting so I had to wait for someone to let me go in front of them so I could exit. I was noticing that everyone seemed to be turning right at the exit. I am in another store with one or two friends. We are at the register paying for our purchases. There is another customer standing behind us. I'm telling my friends about what happened to me at the other store. There were somewhat surprised at how the manager treated me but not completely. My friends and the other customer were agreeing that stores just don't seem to treat customers the way they once did. While we're talking I'm watching a receipt come up from one of the grey credit card machines that are common in stores. The female cashier handed it to my friend. We are in the parking lot. It is still dark. None of us have parked near the other. We're parked in a manner that forms a triangle. Both of my friends have the same name, Anna. One of them said something about the three Anna's and suggested we do the same thing we used to do. Our vehicles weren't cars, or perhaps I should say they remind me more of a kind of toy vehicle a parent might buy for their child. We were all in our vehicles and one of my friends said hello in a singing tone. Then the other one said hello in a singing tone an octave higher. Then I did the same, yet another octave higher. This is what the one friend meant when she suggested we do what we used to do. We are going to go someplace else. They are both dressed considerably more casual than I am so I tell them that I want to go home first and change into something more casual and that I'll meet them at the next place. They are concerned about how long it will take me. I try to assure them that it won't take me that long because my home is so close. I live near where my condo was and I just need to go down 96th St a short distance and then turn left. When I entered 96th St I was no longer in my vehicle. I was traveling by my own power but not walking. What I was preparing to do was perfectly common. My friends were concerned because it was so dark. 96th St didn't have any street lighting and no buildings along the street that would offer any light to the street. Besides that, most of the street was lined with trees so as we looked down the street we could see nothing but pitch black darkness. I told them I wasn't concerned because I was so familiar with the street. I was lying on my stomach with my arms stretched out in front of me, in Superman flying position, and skimming the grassy area on the side of the road as I moved forward. I was going about the speed of a bicycle, certainly faster than walking but slower than a car. At first everything was fine. Then a car passed me heading in the same direction that I was. I was a bit unnerved because it was so close to me. I realized that cars couldn't see me there. I tried to get further from the road but there was hardly any room for me to get over because of the trees and a rise in the ground to my right. Two more cars passed me, again heading in the same direction. Now I was becoming downright nervous, afraid I was going to be hit. I reached a point where there was road construction going on. I had to stand up and try to climb over a hill of dirt and rocks. I was looking for things to hold on to as I did so I would fall and hurt myself. But I also didn't want to get dirty. There were one or two male construction workers watching me. I think one made have said something to me related to it being dangerous but I somehow indicated to him that I would be fine. After I got over that one I think I crossed a street and then there was another one that I also navigated successfully."

"1414"	"(2006-10-02)"	"I was at church at St. Joe. I was standing in the left-side of the aisle next to the end of the pew, the second one from the front. Mother was standing directly across from me also in the aisle. There was someone seated right on the end of each of the two pews. Bill W was sitting in the one I was standing next to. I don't know who was sitting in the one Mother was standing by. I think we had been talking. When it was time to sit I realized that Bill W wasn't going to move over or even acknowledge that I was standing there so I took a few steps back and sat in the third row. Mother did the same. There was no one else sitting in the third pew that I had just gone into. Within seconds, Marlene F and a lot of her family came into that pew. Marlene F came all the way down and sat next to me. As we looked at each other I reached over with my left hand and patted her leg as I told her it was really great to see her. She smiled broadly and nodded her head in agreement, that she was also pleased to see me. There was a small child with her. I'm not sure if it was one of her sibling's children or a grandchild. I'm guessing it was a grandchild. Now there quite a few people standing in the aisle to my right. It was members of Marlene F's family. There were no other seats available so they were standing in the aisle next to the pew where the rest of their family was seated. One of the grandchildren kept talking loudly and moving around more than they liked. A man standing in the aisle scolded the child but in his normal voice, which was fairly deep and loud. He didn't even try to whisper. I know people were looking at him for being so loud and disrupting Mass. They seemed to be more bothered by him than by the child. This happened several more times. Finally, the entire family decided to just go stand in the back of church, including those that were seated in the pew. I am now with members of my family. We're at a point in the Mass where we are all standing. I suddenly realize how I am dressed and think about how upset Mother and Daddy must be by this. I have on my purple sweatpants, matching t-shirt and gym shoes. I have my hands in my pockets and am looking down at my pants and shoes. I'm thinking that, because of time, I had a choice this morning to either change clothes or make it to Mass and I thought Daddy if knew that he would prefer I come to Mass dressed like this. I realize that Marlene F and her family have all left, deciding not to stay for the rest of Mass."

I am standing about twelve or so feet from the house facing away from it. There is a beautiful, mature tree to my right, slightly in front of me. Someone is with me and says something to me."
"1416"	"(2006-10-03)"	"Steve J as at my home helping me to reupholster something that looked like a kneeler from church. We were working in the spare room. It was about three feet long or less maybe six inches wide. It stood six or eight inches off the floor with legs on all four corners. The fabric we were using looked like a forest green velvet. We had attached the fabric on both of the long sides. Steve J picked it up and was looking at the sides. I thought it looked puckered so I asked him what he thought and he agreed. He took the fabric back off. Holding the fabric I tried to make a suggestion for how we could do it to prevent the puckering. It's a method I've seen on a home decorating program. From the look on his face I wasn't sure if he just didn't want me to give him advice, if he didn't believe me, or if he just didn't think it would work. We are sitting in the dining room. Matthew is there. I am sitting along one long side of the dining room table facing away from the kitchen but not up against the table. Steve J is sitting at an angle facing the corner to my right. I told him that I think I did the same thing with my dissertation data that I did with my master's thesis data. He was my thesis advisor and had told me originally that I was collecting way too much data and even when I thought I had pared it down considerably he told me I was still trying to collect too much. With his right hand he reaches over to me, while saying something to me, and grabs my belt and moves it back and forth a few times. He's teasing me about data collection. I know he's teasing because he was very pleased with the results of my thesis. We talk some about children and I smile and say, Greg [unknown in waking life] would never do that would he? He knows I'm teasing but he responds, no, of course not. He is waiting for something before leaving, but very eager to leave. I'm not sure what he is waiting for. He said he would like to go to an Ames store on his way to the airport. I go into the kitchen and open an upper cabinet door to pull out a phone book to see if there is an Ames store between my house and the airport. The wall below these cabinets are open to the dining room I pull out the white pages and begin looking for a listing and then realize it is the white pages for the state where my mother was born. As soon as I realize that I tell Steve J that, explaining that we have it because we a lot of my family lives in that state. I put it back and am getting aggravated because I can't find the book for the state where I live. Steve J gets up and walks up to my left side and tells me he thinks he is going to go ahead and leave. He shows me a small map, about 6 inches by 6 inches. He has marked his route on this map with dark blue ink. He says something about just needing to go right, right, right, and right. I don't think that sounds right and I try to tell him so but he argues with me. I live here and he doesn't, but he's arguing with me about this. Matthew is standing there listening but the look on his face tells me he doesn't understand enough to be able to offer an opinion. I finally just say ok because I don't want to argue."
"1417"	"(2006-10-08)"	"I had been dating this man believing that he was a single father of two daughters. One day he was feeling ill, so he called and asked me to come to his house. I went. He was in bed and his two young daughters were playing. I would guess the youngest one to be about three years old and the older one to be maybe seven or eight. They were both playing together in the older girl's bedroom. His father had asked me to lay down on the bed with him. I just laid on top of the blankets to his right. From time to time each of the girls with coming on for some reason or another. One time when the littlest one came and she was standing next to the bed right in front of me. I think it might have been her nap time. The little girl climbed up on the bed next to me and I was cradling her while she fell asleep. It was just about this time that someone came in the House and he panicked and that's when I realized that he was married. I was absolutely furious. There was no way for me to leave without her seeing me. What I did see her I just kept apologizing over and over trying to convince her that I really did not know that he was married. She said that she realized that. Apparently this had happened before. We were in another room talking. For some reason I went back into the bedroom and the man was gone. He had left the house. I continue to talk to his wife asking her if there was anything I could do to make it up to her. She said of course not. While I was asking her this I was making the bed and trying to help straighten the bedroom, some the girl's toys were lying in there. She thought this was very nice that I was doing this. She started telling me that she had been thinking about hiring someone to help her around the house just one or two days a week. I told her that I could really use the work right now if she would consider hiring me short term. I told her that since she is only looking for someone part-time that would work out really well for me if I still need to keep looking for a full-time position. I think she was going to do that."

"1419"	"(2006-10-13)"	"My treadmill is broken and Bill F is trying to help me fix it. Instead of the round pieces at each side to hold on to while walking the upper, horizontal parts of those were rectangular in shape, with each end connecting into the electronics box instead of the electronics box attaching to them. The electronic elements were inside the rectangular pieces as well as the electronic box. That had come apart on one side and there were wires sticking out of the rectangular piece as well as the electronics box. I think Daddy came and was also then trying to help. He didn't think Bill F and I could fix it ourselves, and we may not have been able to. I don't think it really mattered to me that he wanted to help. I'm in my bedroom now and pointing out that my furniture is in really bad shape. The top of my bedside dresser is literally in pieces. It's as though it were made of numerous single boards that had been attached together and how now come apart. I was trying to keep them in place by just laying them next to each other but I couldn't keep them in place and you could see big gaps between them and see directly into the top drawer. Some of the boards would no longer lay flat either. Some were more significantly warped than others. The inside of the top drawer almost seemed to be illuminated in contrast to the top of the dresser. I'm talking about wanting to replace them as soon as possible after I find another job. Daddy agreed that I should replace the whole set but he thinks I should replace it one piece at a time. I don't really want to do that because I would rather have a matching set. Matthew and I are going shopping and we are discussing places that we might go to look for a decent inexpensive used bedside dresser in the meantime, like a local second-hand store. I still have paint left from repainting this set. If I find something used I can paint it to match the rest of the set."

Some of them, when I opened them, the text was really messed up. I began trying to clean it up.

We were walking around downtown and someone, maybe me, had suggested going into one building that was somehow related to Catholicism. As we entered the building there were two sets of stairs. One leading up and one leading down. I suggested we take the one leading down first as I thought it would be of particular interest to Father. He was surprised. He thought he was familiar with this building but did not realize that this lower floor existed. It looked like a library, though it wasn't quiet like a library. There is a small sitting area and we are sitting and talking with each other. I don't think Father is sitting with us. We are talking mostly about family members. Mother is standing behind a sofa or loveseat where I am sitting. She is saying something about Aunt P and how she is planning to go somewhere with her and that she doesn't want to go. This doesn't surprise the rest of us because they are very few places that Mother does want to go regardless of who she is going with. But since her and Aunt P don't get along very well, she is particularly reluctant to go with her. I think they are going to visit a cemetery."

The second was something I had never heard before and thought it was very odd. There was another reason that I questioned their choice of names but now I can't explain what it was. Maybe because I thought they were too similar. Later I realized that they had quadruplets, not twins. I had a picture of them with the four babies. I was running around showing the picture to members of my family and saying over and over, Tony S and Dorothy S had four babies. I immediately thought that I really needed to go see them now. But I also don't want to go see them while I am still unemployed. "
"1428"	"(2006-10-17)"	"People were coming to my house to buy things I had listed for sale somewhere. One young man came to buy a book. I found out later that he is a priest. The book he purchased was a hardback but had it's dust jacket and looked like new. It was very thick, easily 500+ pages. He had ridden a bicycle there. I asked him if he wanted me to put it in a bag for him but then said I was going to because I didn't want it to get dirty or damaged but I thought it would be easier for him to carry on his bike. I had some plastic bags hanging on the wall. They were flat and attached together, just like at the grocery store. These were a much heavier plastic, shiny, slick, and very dark in color. A woman came and bought a bunch of cleaning supplies. I was going to need to use three or four bags for all of it. There were quite a few women in the house. It was two stories but didn't look like my waking life home. The staircase was open all the way to the second floor and it was on the opposite wall from my waking life home. I was sitting on the steps, as were some of the other women. Some of us were sitting next to the wall and others next to the banister. Many of them were just standing around in the living room. That's where the woman was who was buying the cleaning products. She was excited to be getting them for some reason and was getting out her wallet to pay me. They were talking and joking around about sexual things. Not crude or really obnoxious, but still in a way that made me uncomfortable. I didn't say anything against or to join in. I just sat and smiled politely. This young priest is coming down the steps and walking between the two rows of women sitting on the steps. I felt embarrassed that he had heard that, even though I hadn't said anything, I hadn't spoken up to stop it so that was just as bad. I wondered if maybe he hadn't heard. Then I saw a polite smile on his face too and realized that he had heard some of it. That made me feel better for not speaking up. I had a swing sitting in front of my house, similar to the one I have on my patio in waking life. The neighbors had a similar swing on their patio. Matthew and a male friend of his were over there sitting in the neighbor's swing. I was in a very good mood, feeling very happy and acting almost giddy. It was just beginning to rain, just sprinkling really. I went over there and told them that I had just remembered something that I wanted to ask them to do for me while they were here. I explained that I wanted the swing from my front yard brought back to the patio and the thing that is on the patio now taken to the front. I don't know what the thing was on the patio. It had a frame similar to the swing. But I also knew I wanted them to remove the top pieces that used to hold the awning before they took it to the front yard."

"1431"	"(2006-10-21)"	"Dan M owned a candy store in the mall. I was at the store visiting with him. A male friend of his is there as well. Dan M tells me that he has been in love with me for several years. I was quite surprised by this. He has been waiting to tell me because he wanted to save enough money first so he could do the things for me that he wants to do. He pulled out some kind of financial records and was pointing to various numbers and explaining them to me. The bottom line is that he had over a million dollars. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that he had that kind of money, that he was in love with me, or that he would do that for me. He wanted to pay off my student loans and other debts. His friend is leaning on the counter and nodded his head yes when I looked over at him in disbelief. Some times he kind of shrugged his shoulders and tilted his head to the right as if to say, yes, he really did this and this is really what he wants. I'm not sure what to make of it. Part of me is very flattered and pleased that he feels this way. Part of me is not sure how I feel. I don't know if there is that kind of chemistry between us, but realize that maybe I've not felt any chemistry because neither of us has allowed it. For most of the years that I've known him he has been in a relationship. I have come to consider him a very dear friend, but nothing more. He moves so he is facing me and pulls me in and kisses me. This is fine. I mean it feels okay, though I don't feel any sparks or anything. I tell him about the first time we kind of met. He had attended one of my dream workshops. I noticed him almost immediately and thought that he was attractive. I was disappointed when he left right after the workshop. He has four or five young female employees who have come in to work. They seem to know something about who I am. Most of the candy is in square, clear plastic, bins that are stacked five feet high. The front of each one has an opening to access the candy. Apparently, Dan M lets the employees eat candy while they are working as I see them each occasionally reach in a bin for a piece. They offer me a piece and I accept. Dan M and I are walking through the mall with our arms around each other's back. I'm thinking how nice this feels and that I could really get use to this, that I think I could actually like this and be comfortable in a relationship with Dan M. We're mostly just window shopping and talking casually. I just keep thinking how good it feels, and that it feels better and better. We get separated for some reason and I'm trying to find him. This mall has an unusual layout. I get lost more than once. I am in a department store and find myself in the furniture department. I want to just sit and rest. There was just barely room to walk in between all of the furniture. I wondered if I could find a comfortable chair with a high back so I could sit and rest without being spotted by an employee. I decide to keep walking and trying to find my way out. I end up in another store that is very odd compared to others. There are numerous oddly shaped, small rooms with white walls. Each has a few mannequins and nothing more. I see a salesclerk and tell her that I am lost and where I am trying to go. She tells me I really am lost and gives me directions that seem very incomplete and confusing to me. She doesn't seem to want to be bothered with me so I just find my way out myself. I finally make it back to Dan M's store and he isn't there. One of his employees tell me that he went someplace across the mall. I head over to find him and meet him on his way back. The place he had been was a restaurant and he had been drinking while he was there. I could tell he was slightly affected by the alcohol. This was a little bothersome to me but I wasn't going to let that have a negative impact on our relationship. We were walking through the mall again to pick up some things that he had ordered. As best I can describe them they were decorative things for his home. He had apparently paid a deposit on them. At the first store, there were two items that sat on the floor and were about three or four feet tall and maybe 12 inches square or diameter. I don't recall the shape exactly. They were brown and black. The store clerk told him the balance owed was $1999.00. I was shocked. Dan M smiled and said, really, as though he didn't remember what the balance was but pulled out his wallet. It didn't seem to be a problem to him at all. Something very similar happened at the next store we went to. "
"1432"	"(2006-10-23)"	"Matthew and I are at Kings Island. We hadn't gone there for entertainment, but for some other reason. We were there early in the day. We were sitting there waiting for something or someone and I suggested to Matthew that maybe we could ride the roller coaster while we're there. He didn't immediately agree or disagree with me. Then we got up and started walking, maybe towards the roller coaster. We see Bev and John S. They are riding in something like a golf cart. They pull up along side us and we all stop to talk. We hadn't expected to see them. I'm thinking about the fact that I bet they come more often now that they have this cart because they don't have to do so much walking. That would make it less tiring and more enjoyable. They don't have their children with them. They take off again and Matthew and I decide to try to catch up with them. We get stopped in the crowd because there are so many people around we can't get through. Matthew sees something up ahead of us and says something like, oh there's....I can't remember what he said it was. I think it had something to do with us trying to catch up to Bev and John. He took off to go up to whatever it was. I think he was going to come right back. I stood there and waited and waited but he didn't come back. I got kind of upset. I thought he was just going 30 or 40 feet ahead of me. I finally made my way up there and he was no where to be seen. Then I got upset because I really do not like being in crowds, especially not alone. And no longer like being in unfamiliar places alone either. I was trying not to feel too panicked. Now, I'm standing next to one of the rides. At least that's what I think it is originally but it seems to have morphed into something that looks like a single slide, not that high, that ends in a single spiral at the bottom. People come down the slide and continue around this single spiral. I'm watching people come down. There are two employees at the top of the slide helping people. There are also a couple of employees at the bottom of the slide helping. Then I see a bunch of stuff come down the slide instead of people. It's stuff like people's belongings and bed linens and bath towels. Some of it is stuffed animals. As I'm standing there watching this I realize that there are groups of people, may families and this is a kind of entryway into the park. These groups of people are there for a specific reason other than to be visitors or for the entertainment and attractions. The employees are helping these groups of people enter the park through this slide. The groups of people have brought this stuff with them that I saw coming down the slide. Someone is taking the stuffed animals off of the slide one by one. The are relatively small, maybe 12-18 inches in length and not that big in width. They are more long and thin stuffed animals than short and chubby like a teddy bear. Someone is handing them to me. There is some kind of a shelf or box like container that is open on the side. They are handing the stuffed animals to me to stand them in this container. They want me to start at one end and line them up that way. It is only as deep as the stuffed animals are wide. Apparently I wasn't doing it the way they wanted me to and they showed me that they wanted the first one to face the wall of the container and then line each of the others up behind the first one facing the same way. It only held four or five of them. I'm in an indoor, underground location. The families each have their own area down there. It is a very long, not very wide, almost tunnel like area. The ceilings don't feel very high. The areas for each of the families are not divided by walls. In each area there is a platform type thing that is about five or six feet tall, maybe three feet wide, and about 10 or 12 feet long. On each and there is a set of steps leading up to the platform. The each look a little different than the others, in color or how they are constructed. For example, some of them may be carpeted, some are painted but in different colors, etc. as I'm walking through this area I realize that each of these families, or groups, are there for a competition. Perhaps it is a talent competition. These platforms are for them to practice on. They each have very different things that they are doing though, so it gives the feeling of something like a variety show or a circus, where there are lots of different types of acts. I'm walking through here trying to find Matthew, and I'm getting very frustrated. I decide that I need to go back up above ground to find him but now I can't find a place to go back above ground. All of these individual family areas with all of these staircases is causing me to feel more disoriented and confused. I see someone that I think maybe an employee there so I stop and ask them for directions to get back above ground. They try to give me directions but I think I must get confused again because I don't find it. I go back to the same person to ask again but they seemed to be irritated with me now. So I just walk away and keep trying myself. I finally find Matthew down there. He knows the way back above ground so we are going back up together and then go home. The place that we go up above ground is at the end of the tunnel. As we approach I see an area with exercise equipment. However, it's very unusual looking equipment, like nothing I've seen before. Some of it reminds me of the type of equipment a football team which used for practice, like the things they would use to practice tackling or things that they would be pushing against with their shoulders as they try to run forward. I feel very tense, like I have a lot of built-up anxiety or stress. I look at this equipment and think it might be a very good way for me to get rid of some of this tension. I'm standing there doing something with some of it trying to figure out how to use it. I asked Matthew, and he shows me how to use it. I noticed these things attached to some of the equipment. I see the same things are also attached some places on the walls. They look like a rectangular boxes and if you open them they contain plastic bottles for water or beverages. They look very dirty or a nasty. I decide it would be a nice thing to do to clean them up for whoever uses them. So go ahead and I clean them up and then someone who works there walks up to me. I told him what I did. Instead of appreciating it he seems bothered by the fact that I did this. Thank you I are now ready to go above ground. The way to get up is to climb up a ladder that is attached to the end wall. There is a fairly small opening at the top of the ladder that we have to crawl through to get out. Before we climb up the ladder we see these black rectangular kind of shape to object leaning against the wall. Matthew suggest that we each take one up with us to use and once we get through the opening. Apparently, once we get through the opening, we can't just stand up and walk through the park. I am now with three other people and Matthew is not one of those. We are trying to escape. We each of one of these black things though they now seem to be different sizes and shapes. We are going to use them as some kind of transportation, kind of like a sled though I don't know what is going to propel us. We see some other kind of objects and we each take two. There might be more than two. One appears to be something to sit on and the other, or others, we will use to propel us forward. However it is that they work were going to use them to get away, or to escape. It seems as though we are outdoors now and on pavement just inside the park. It looks like we are exiting the park on to a road. The place that were exiting from and the road they were exiting on to appears to have a downward slope. We are exiting at an angle on to the road. It reminds me of the way an entrance ramp to the highway enters on to the highway. And I we're concerned and one because of the traffic and cars being able to see us clearly with us being on these objects and so close to the ground also. It feels very dangerous. It seems to me that we'd pull off and stop to figure out what to do. Now we're running through the inside of a building, still in an effort to escape. The building looks like a huge warehouse and there is stuff everywhere. They're apparently isn't even room to walk, because to get through we have to actually run across the top of these piles all of boxes and such. Some of the piles of things aren't boxes, they are very soft and plush is maybe a good word to describe them. Almost as though they are piles of blankets or pillows. As we're doing this we notice some very large objects that are rectangular in shape. Like the thing is that we were using before they are plastic but these are in a variety of colors. I grab one that is lime green. They are long enough that we can sit upright on them and stretch out our legs in front of us. We each take one and are using them as sleds on something that I can best describe as a very long slide that goes through this building.But it's not straight, but rather winds through the building until we exit. This seems to happen several times. We exit one building and find ourselves in another find some kind of objects to use and slide our way winding through the building until we exit again and then the same thing happens over. At one point we exit on to a green grassy area. There are four or so employees each standing with a customer or guest, working with them to practice their golf putting. I hear one of the employees say that the park has a service for guests, where the guests can request the service of one of these employees for an entire day and the employee will help the guest with anything they want help with. I quickly tell the three people that I'm with about this. I suggest that maybe they can help us get away since they are required to help us with anything that we ask for help with. I tell them that I think it will be easier for us to get away if we have these employees hoping each of us. Maybe I think it's because they know their way around this area better, or maybe I think it's because if there's two of us on each of these objects we will be better able to get away simply because of having more manpower. So we end up telling for the employees that we want their services and so they have to help us. So we now each have an employee with us on these objects that we are trying to get away on. So now as were sliding through the building each of us with an employee with us on our slide it's the last time that this happens. The buildings are all fairly dark and dingy. There is no visible color, and very little light. The area that were moving through is just wide enough for these things that were using as sleds. The thing that we're sliding on through each of these buildings seems to change from time to time. As we get close to exiting this final building the employees warned us that we need to be very careful and try to slow ourselves down because we will be exiting onto water. They tell us that the water will become ice. We need to be especially careful at that point. It would enter the ice to fast we could get turned over and injured. So, we are all trying to slow down and brace ourselves preparing for this. I am second in line of before us and I see a head of me were getting ready to exit the building the water on the other side and it's like the rushing water. I become nervous and tense, wondering if we can even enter the water without getting dumped over. One as we get close to the place where the water turns to ice I notice something on the wall to my right. The wall itself appears to be gray cement. It looks like there is something like a foam forming on this wall. It reminds me of the type of insulation foam that is used in buildings, where they spray it on and then it expands, except it's not nearly that large. It is maybe an inch or two high but runs along the wall. The employee in front of me points to it and tells me that this is the ice forming. I turned a bit to my right and point this out to the person behind me and tell down that this employee has told me that this is the ice forming. So as the sled in front of me approaches the ice they managed to slow themselves down an off so they can enter the eye is more slowly and carefully so as not to get turned over and harmed. All I and the employee with me do the same thing as do the people behind us. We don't go very far until we see something running two are right that looks like a rail fence made of two by fours. Do to people on the sled in front of me slide underneath the lowest rail and down a very short but somewhat steep hill to the ground below. I can see that there are a lot of people standing down there watching for us. This appears to be a good thing, that these people recognize that we are helping someone. As the two people, the person who is with me originally and the employee, in front of me land on the ground below and stand up, some of the people who have been standing around watching run up to them to greet and hug them. The two people with me then go into a nearby building to get warm. I and the employee with me now does the same thing. And those behind me then do the same thing."
"1433"	"(2006-10-24)"	"Something about the book ""The Screwtape Letters."" I'm not sure we were trying to identify a certain letter in the book or if we were just discussing the letters. It almost seems as though we are comparing some of them to try to identify which is the ""right"" one for what ever it is we are discussing."
"1434"	"(2006-10-28)"	"I was at a social gathering at a female friend's home. I was walking around admiring the outside of this house. It was a very large, two-story, old, grey stone house. It wasn't the size of a mansion, but larger than the average home. It had a very dignified look and presence. There seemed to be quite a bit of front landscaping. There was a double-wide sidewalk that ran the width of the house and then three that extended out parallel from that. They were all double-wide as well. All of these sidewalks were covered, yet open on the sides. Cement pillars supported the cover. There was lush soft landscaping on either side of the sidewalks that came out from the house, bushes, trees, flowers, and grass. It was quite beautiful. I was sitting outside with her and two other women. Three of us were sitting in a row. I was on the right end and Jane H on the left end. One woman was sitting facing the other three of us. I was talking to Jane H about our CRHP sisters, though she wasn't in CRHP in waking life. I asked about Judy Switzerland [unknown in waking life] . Jane H said that Judy had moved to another country with a female friend of hers for some kind of work. Her husband was mentioned by one of us. We then started talking about how many have moved away since our CRHP weekend. We were trying to think of everyone's names. I mentioned that I rarely talk with anyone anymore. I mentioned that I still talk with Amy S occasionally. I mentioned that, of course we all still hear from Karen K every so often now that she has had a baby and she sends us baby pictures. The owner of the home was now walking with me and we were talking about some of the bushes that were right next to the sidewalks and beginning to encroach on the walking area. We were discussing what she might do about that as she didn't want them to block the paths. I was familiar with the home's origin, but I don't know how or why I knew about it. The man who built it took great pride in the home and created it to be a thing of beauty for people who passed to enjoy. He had been deceased for some time now. The current owner was a descendent but had let the outside of the home fall into disrepair. It wasn't that she didn't care about it. I think it was more that she either didn't know what to do or didn't have time or wanted help, something like that. If she had a plan to restore it she had someone who could do the work for her. As we're walking the grounds we're talking about what she could do as a starting point, talking about removing some bushes, planting new ones in some places. Along the front of the grounds there is a low, stone wall. It is the same grey stone that is on the exterior of the home itself. Coming up from the stone wall are stone pillars that support the overhead covers. Each pillar juts out a bit from the wall rather than being part of one long smooth line. The gardener is walking with us now and I ask him if he has any topiaries that are maybe just 3 or 4 feet tall and not very large in diameter. He says that he does. Pointing to the area that I am talking about, I tell he and the owner that I think it would look really beautiful to have a few topiaries around each of these pillars. I think it would take five around each pillar. They both agree that they think it would look very nice so the owner tells the gardener to begin that work immediately. As we continue to walk I notice several places that have fountains and/or pools of water. None of the fountains are functioning and the pools of water are full of natural debris and green with algae. I suggest that she have the gardener clean those out and get them functional again. There is now a man with us, perhaps her husband. He mentions that the pools and fountains will be an expensive endeavor. I said I understand that so maybe that could be something that they could do in the future. In the meantime they could at least have the gardener clean out what is there to make them more pleasing to the eye. One of the fountains is at the front of the property where anyone passing by would see it. I suggest that they might at least want to get that one functioning right away to return to the purpose of the original owner, that being the pleasure of those who pass by. I return early the next morning, when the sun is just beginning to rise so it is still fairly dark outside. I am standing on the sidewalk across the street from the house. I notice that the stone wall extends further on one end than I had realized the day before. I make a mental note to make sure the gardener tends to it the same as the other. There is a row of stones of another color that runs horizontally along the wall, about halfway up. It is a bit wider around the pillars. They seem to be a deep red color. I note that the gardener needs to be sure to clean those on the sections that I just noticed as well as on the sections that we discussed yesterday. The place that I was there to go into isn't open yet. I notice a very small store next door that is open. It reminds me of a corner grocery in a very small town. I go in and there are several employees standing and talking. They seem somewhat annoyed that I have come in though I'm not sure why. I decide it must be that they are not used to customers coming in this early and interrupting their morning chat. I get two small bags of snacks, peanuts and something else, to have for breakfast. I pay for them and begin eating them. I ask if I can set my things down on the floor there until I can get in to the place next door. They tell me that is fine, but again seem annoyed or bothered."
"1435"	"(2006-10-28)"	"BJ and Todd A were spending the night with Matthew and I at the condo. Iwas sleeping on an extra bed in my bedroom. I had my headboard against the window and this extra bed was sitting parallel at the foot of my bed. BJ was sleeping in Matthew's room and Todd A was sleeping in the upstairs bathroom. At first I thought we had set up a cot in that bathroom, alongside the tub, and that he was sleeping there. I was walking toward my bedroom in the hallway and from the corner of my eye I saw Todd A sitting in there and thought he was sitting on the cot. I entered into that bathroom from my bedroom and, though I didn't see Todd A at that time, I told him I was going to close the door between the toilet and the sink to give him more privacy. I closed the door and went back into my bedroom. I asked Matthew if he had set up the cot in there for Todd A and he said he hadn't. I told him that he needed something to sleep on. I realized then that when I saw Todd A sitting in there and leaning back against the wall that he intended to sleep sitting up on the toilet. I told Matthew that we couldn't have that. I went back into the bathroom and told him I would be much more comfortable if he would sleep downstairs on the sofa or on the pull-out bed in the sofa. He said he would be much more comfortable if he were sleeping on the floor in the bathroom. I just shrugged my shoulders and walked away. I went into Matthew's room to check on BJ. His room looked different than in waking life, primarily because it was much larger and it didn't have the loft window. The headboard of his bed was against the back wall and there was a smaller bed sitting parallel at the foot of his bed. BJ was lying in the smaller bed. I asked her what she was doing in the ""doll"" bed. It was so small that she couldn't even stretch out. I asked her why she wasn't sleeping in Matthew's bed. She said she was fine where she was. I tried to convince her to sleep in the other bed but she argued with me. I walked over to Matthew's bed and pulled back the bedspread and blanket. I was trying to entice her to sleep there by pointing out how many pillows there were and how soft they were. There was two for her had and one for under her leg to support her back. I rubbed the blanket and said how soft it was. The linens on the bed were pale yellow and white. She finally got up and crawled in from the foot of the bed. I think she was going to take some medicine and I asked her if I could get her a glass of water. She said yes, that would be nice, that she would appreciate that. I went downstairs to get a glass of water for her. Though, I didn't go down the normal way. It was though I took the steps two or three at a time, feeling almost as though I were floating and barely touching any of the steps. I got down to the first floor very quickly this way. I opened the cabinet to get something for her water and decided on a regular glass instead of plastic. I didn't put any ice in it. I went back upstairs. As I handed it to her I said I hoped that it was okay that I hadn't put ice in it. She said that she actually prefers it that way. She took her medicine and handed the glass back to me. I said it was fine if she wanted to keep it, that she could set it on the bedside table. She looked as if looking for a coaster. I told her that it wouldn't hurt the table to just have it sitting there without a coaster. The bedside table was the one I have in waking life, only it looked the way it did before I modified and refinished it. I sat the glass water down and said again that it really was fine there. We were talking about the faux finish on the walls. I had told her once about how I had painted the walls here but she didn't understand what I was trying to explain. Now that she was there I reminded her of the conversation and pointed out the walls to her. She was going on and on about how much she liked it. I pointed out some spots where I had too much paint on my roller for the second color and how those areas didn't look as good. As I was talking I picked up a paint roller and was repainting part of it to show her how I did it. Now I was almost covering up the pattern in some areas. She reached over and put her hand flat against the wall to see how it felt and put her hand right on top of wet paint. I apologized that she now had paint on her hand and she said that wasn't a problem at all. I was thinking about the fact that this paint does wash off very easily with soap and water. In waking life there was a wood stair rail that ran along the upstairs hallway that looked down into the living room. In the dream it was a wrought-iron piece that ran floor-to-ceiling and at the top of the steps it opened like a door, so the entire thing could be closed off. I suppose this would be a nice safety feature for small children who couldn't navigate steps."

"1437"	"(2006-10-30)"	"Joe P was cutting my hair and it looked great as usual. He had cut it just a bit different this time, layering it along the front so it framed my face beautifully. It looked and felt very light and feathery. It looks like a longer version of the style I had at age thirty. I asked him if he had done the texturizing on top of my head as it still seemed a bit flat to me, although I couldn't remember if it had been long enough since the last time he did it. Even though it looked great, he kept working on it. We were talking so I wasn't paying attention to what he was doing. When he finished I looked in the mirror and was horrified. He had taken a beautiful hairstyle and created pigtails on either side of my head, just above my ears, sticking straight out. He had done something I hadn't seen before with a small section of hair just in front of each rubber band. I thought that little thing was pretty but I hated the pigtails. I was trying not to cry. He could tell I wasn't happy but was acting indignant about it, as though there was no reason for me to not like it. I got up and quickly started to leave. As I was walking away I heard someone else say something. I stopped and turned around, leaned slightly forward and said, maybe it's because I grew up in a small country town and left there. I don't want to look like a country girl. I was in several different places throughout the dreams. In one of those places I was having a conversation with one or more people about different aspects of spirituality. There were definitely differing opinions. Once was a shopping mall. I was going back to my car and decided that the most direct and quickest route was through Macy's department store. As I was walking through the mall I see a bellboy with two room service carts. One had only one thing on it, a plate with something on it. He was pushing one and pulling one. I wasn't sure I knew my way through Macy's, or which door to exit to be closest to my car. I thought I just needed to go straight to the opposite side of where I was. I had to walk around perfume and jewelry counters and then through the furniture department. As I was walking through the furniture department I saw a male sales person talking on his cell phone. As soon as he saw me I could hear him tell the person that he was talking to that he needed to go. I began to walk faster as I did not want him to approach me and try to sell me furniture."
"1438"	"(2006-10-31)"	"I was doing computer work for someone and not at my home. There were other people around. I had two Excel workbooks open. One had a lot of sheets to it with many entries on each sheet. I was looking up something about some of the numbers from the first workbook in the second workbook. The numbers I was looking up looked slightly different than the others. That's how I knew which ones I needed to look up. If I found what I was looking for in the second workbook I would cut and paste the entry from the first workbook into the second and then go back and delete the empty line. I had gone through all of the sheets. I was now going through them again because something had changed that led us to believe that I might now find more of them. I did sheet after sheet and find no more. There was a discussion about a disagreement going on between some of the people."
"1439"	"(2006-10-31)"	"At the CAS office, though it doesn't look like it does in waking life. It has quite a few more rooms than in waking life. A meeting there. Bill C in his office reading a newspaper. He has it open and holding it up. I can't see him for the paper. I'm talking to him and he eventually lowers the paper and looks at me while we're talking. I notice that he is alone in the office and I wonder if either of the other two men still work for him. There are a lot of people there to work on a project or projects. We divide into teams and I am the team leader for one of the teams. I tell my team we are going to the room at the back of the office because there is lots of stuff there that we can use. This is where all of the books and such are stored. Bryan N comes in and says something to me. I do little more than acknowledge him. I tell my group that the book, BCB, would be especially helpful."
"1440"	"(2006-11-01)"	"I'm working in Excel, on just one spreadsheet. I am working with numbers in one column and then go to another column and work on numbers. I think I was comparing them for discrepancies. In a third column I typed yes or no, depending on whether or not there were discrepancies."
"1441"	"(2006-11-03)"	"I fell asleep at the wheel of my car. When I woke up I was driving the wrong direction on a very busy one-way, two-lane road. I was in the right hand lane, the lane to my right. There was a long line of semi-trailer trucks in the same lane headed towards me. A hundred feet or so ahead of me and to my right there was another road. The trucks were all turning there. I decided that the best way to get off of this one-way road or to turn around was to turn there as well. It was a dead-end at a truck stop with a very expansive parking lot. There were quite a few passenger cars there as well. There were rows of something embedded in the pavement, yet protruding from it, in some places. It damage tires but it was very rough to drive over. The best I can describe them as is rows of small squares of raised pavement. I got distracted while I was driving and was lost so I needed to get a map so I could find my way home. I had been presenting a workshop on dreams some place. There was a second small building at this truck stop. It had brown siding and there was an outdoor sitting area with an overhead to protect people from the elements. It was a very small square area with park benches around the perimeter. People were sitting on some of them. There was a map attached to a wooden sign and post, protected by plexiglass. I walked over to the map to figure out where I was and how to get where I needed to go. I was having a conversation with a woman who had two small children with her. Someone else, an older man, also said something to me. As I was looking at this map, some were wanting to look at the map."
"1442"	"(2006-11-04)"	"I was at a conference. I saw Tim W. As soon as he saw me he rushed over to me and bent down and gave me a big, tight hug and told me how nice it was to see me. It did that two more times. I had a huge smile on my face, telling him how nice it was to see him also. I was thinking how nice it was that he seemed so happy to see me. He had a group of employees with him, maybe eight or ten people. He was behaving in ways that were not like him, at least not like I knew him to be 16 years ago. While I don't recall the behaviors now, I recall that I was disappointed to see him behaving like this."
"1443"	"(2006-11-05)"	"I was working at a computer on some question and answers to be used by someone else but I can't remember the purpose. There were quite a few people around. I had to identify a group of one type of questions first and then another."
"1444"	"(2006-11-05)"	"I was at my home with most of my extended family, though they were different people than in waking life. Matthew had gone shopping with me to buy a birthday present for one of my brothers. He decided that a tool chest was a good idea so that's what I bought. For some reason I thought the box had a combination of a tool box and a tabletop grill in it. Later I realized that I had thought that because the toolbox was made by a company that is known for their grills and has the word grill in their company name. The gift was actually just an oversized, portable, metal toolbox. My brother seemed to really like the gift."
"1445"	"(2006-11-05)"	"I was sitting somewhere talking to a famous, black rapper. I would say he was in his late 20's or early 30's and somewhat small in stature and build. He was sitting on the end of a sofa to my right and I was sitting in an arm chair sitting parallel to the sofa. We were eating something. He struck up a conversation about his wife and how hard she works. That somehow led to him saying something about how difficult it must be for single parents. I told him that I was a single parent for 18 years. He looked very surprised, stopped eating, turned more to face me, leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and asked me why? I shrugged my shoulders, tilted my head slightly to my right and quietly answered that I suppose I have commitment issues. I told him that I wanted to make sure I got it right if I got married a second time. He said, but you've been asked haven't you. I told him that I had been asked, but I have never felt confident that it what was right or that it was a marriage I could make last 'til death do us part.' He had a very sad look on his face. I understood the look of sadness as it sometimes makes me sad myself. I try to comfort myself with thoughts that perhaps God has called me to a single life. I recognize that many of the professional and academic things I have done over the last twenty years I may not have been able to do had I been married. Besides, there is no guarantee that life would have been easier or better."
"1446"	"(2006-11-07)"	"I was at an SAID function. I was standing by a wire fence that was maybe 7 or 8 feet high. The wire formed 6 inch squares. I was talking with a man that I don't know. On the other side of the fence, about 10 or 12 feet away was another wire fence. This one was in disrepair and only 3 feet high. On the other side of that fence was a large open area and a group of SAID members were playing baseball. There didn't seem to be an actual game going on. Some small groups of people were simply tossing a ball back and forth and other groups were batting. I asked one of them if I climbed over the tall fence if they would stand below and catch me. I didn't actually think I would fall but I wanted someone there in case I did. They didn't come over. I climbed the fence and as I started to climb over the fence swayed to the ground and I landed gently on my feet before the fence swayed back to its upright position. Now the other fence wasn't there. I walked over to one of the groups that was throwing a baseball. I wanted to join in but didn't have a ball glove and saw how hard and fast they there throwing it. I decided to go sit along the fence and just watch. I was sitting with my knees to my chest, back against the fence, and my arms resting on my knees. Harry B came walking up to me at a brisk pace and cheerfully said something to me as he sat down alongside me. I said something to the effect that it was a good day for sitting alone curled up in my room. He said okay, got up and walked away. I immediately realized that I shouldn't have responded that way. First of all because that is not how I want to portray myself to others, but also because that is not the way I want to be. I want to be more positive, cheerful, and engaging with others. I suddenly realized that all of the members were heading back to the hotel and were already 100 or more feet away. I jumped up and ran to try to catch up with them because I wasn't sure I knew my way back and didn't want to get lost. They were walking through a heavily wooded area. In some places the brush was waist high or higher. I could hear the others in front of me talking but I lost sight of them and became almost frantic about getting lost out there. There were 2 or 3 that had stayed behind in one part of the woods and were talking. I looked at them, I suppose with a facial expression that showed my concern, and then simply nodded towards the group and reassured me to keep going. I am back at the hotel with a man [unknown in waking life] and we went to find Malachi B. He was in his room very upset about something he had done and concerned about what people would think. He thought people would think less of him, or not like him, or be disappointed in him. It seemed that he thought it was related to some work he had done or the way he presented himself. We tried to reassure him that there was nothing to be concerned about. Myself and this other man were sitting on the floor while Mark paced the room, talking and worrying. He finally sat down at a desk and began to type. I had to look twice to see what he was working on and realized that he had brought a typewriter with him. I was thinking that I didn't know anyone even used a typewriter anymore. The words showed up on the paper in very dark lettering. He seemed to make no errors as he typed and the layout of what he typed was very distinctive. I saw something else unusual in his room that I realized he had brought with him. This got me to thinking about how much baggage he had traveled with. I am now in my room and hear someone knock. I went to the door and it was Malachi B. He seemed excited to show me what he had bought. He had gone to a store to buy things that would make him appear more feminine. One of the things was a light pink hat with white lace on it. I couldn't believe he had bought such a thing and was seriously intending to wear it. He actually seemed excited about it. I was getting a bit frustrated with him at this point and thinking that this just doesn't look like him at all and that people like him best as himself. He doesn't need to do this. He could tell by my expression that I didn't really like it. I wanted to force his back against the wall and tell him very strongly that he does not need to do things like this. I was trying to remember if he was married or not. If he wasn't, I was going to kiss him to let him know that he is perfect and attractive in many ways, not just physically, just the way he is."
"1447"	"(2006-11-08)"	"I was in St. Joe staying with my family for a few days at my birth home. There must have been a family event going on because there were quite a few family members around. The extended visit didn't seem to be bothering me. I was out in the garage with some of the family. We were talking and laughing. The large door must have been open because it was very light, in a way that only natural sunlight produces. Gary S showed up unexpectedly. I was so surprised and at first a bit nervous or anxious. He said he had left his job and was in the process of moving to this area. When I asked him why he said he knew I would not be willing to move away from my family. I made sure he knew that I did not want to live in St. Joe or anywhere near this close to them. I love them dearly but I don't want to live that close. I think he understood that. I was also concerned that he had left his job to be with me. I knew he wouldn't be able to find a job in my geographic area that would allow him to work in the same industry. That didn't seem to bother him and he seemed confident that he could find a good position that he would enjoy in another industry. The more time we spent together, the more comfortable I became with the whole idea. When we were together it was almost as though we had never been apart. The same chemistry was certainly there. My parents seemed to like him. They invited him to stay with them as well, while I was still there. He was in the bathtub with the tub doors closed and I went in to use the sink, leaving the door open behind me. Next to the sink was something else, kind of like a sink, only it was less than half the size of the sink and it was close to the front edge of the counter and raised above the counter unlike a traditional sink. It was full of dirty, nasty looking water. I realized that it was plugged and afraid it would overflow. I was using my hand to try to move some of the water into the large sink but it wasn't very effective and not doing much good. Daddy came in with a small plunger and cleared the clog. He said that this happens often. I am in the bathtub with Gary. It is a very large, deep tub. We are being very affectionate, kissing and touching, but nothing more. Others knew we were in the bath together but it didn't seem to bother anyone. Wherever we went or whatever we did, we were usually holding hands, kissing, being affectionate in ways that we considered appropriate when being around others. We are sitting together in the front seat of a car, I was sitting close to Gary S, though not right next to him. Two of my family members were in the back seat. We don't seem to be going anywhere. The car seems to be parked at the house, so I don't know why we would be in it. It was dark outside. I leaned over against him and put my head against his chest. I began stroking his chest through his buttoned dress shirt. I slowly and inconspicuously opened the first two or three buttons so I could caress his chest. I remembered how smooth his skin was and noticed it seemed just has smooth after so many years had passed. He looked down into my eyes and then leaned down and kissed me ever so lightly, gently, yet with so much feeling. It suddenly felt perfect to be there with him. The family members in the back seat decided to get out of the car and give us some time alone. There was a blanket hanging over the back of the seat. Gary S removed his shirt. As I laid my head against his bare chest I pulled the blanket up around us. We continued with these very gentle yet deeply affectionate embraces and kisses."

It was a UPS sticker that they leave when they tried to deliver a package and I wasn't home. I wondered how long it had been there and surprised that I hadn't seen it earlier. I opened the front door just far enough to reach out and pull the sticker off of the window and then closed the door back up. I was thinking about when I could get to the office to pick it up and also wondering what it was. I didn't remember ordering anything."
"1449"	"(2006-11-11)"	"A parish council election bad dream. At the Sunday 8:00 am Mass Father Jerry decided to make a change in the parish council election that had started the evening before. One of the nominees was standing in front of church and she said something that she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with. However, Father Jerry really didn't like it. He immediately told the congregation that she would not be eligible to be voted in to the parish council. He then he was going to announce some names and he wanted the people he announced to come to the front of church. He called five or six people. After they all got to the front of church he announced that these six people were now nominees along with the people on the ballot. I was aggravated by this and concerned about what this was going to do to the process I already had in place."

Peggy K and Mike H are sitting perpendicular to each other. Mike H tells me that he had not intended to make the announcement before Mass and he clearly didn't want to do it. He wasn't asking anyone else to do it nor did he say that he wouldn't do it. He put his elbows on his knees and his face in the palms of his hands, rubbing his face. I stood there and debated whether or not to offer to do it for him, though I really didn't want to do it either."

For some reason we were going to be spending the night there in an office suite, but not the CAS suite. We had come up with makeshift sleeping quarters. BJ decided she was going to sleep with this man that I was interested in, even though she knew of my interest. It didn't bother her. I think he put her off and wouldn't agree to share a bed with her because of his interest in me. I was very concerned about being in that building because I did not want to run into Bill C or for him to even see me."

"1457"	"(2006-11-17)"	"I was Aunt H and Aunt P's house. Aunt H's health had been declining and she was having more and more trouble doing things herself, especially getting around the house. They told me that she mostly just stays in the one room anymore. While I was there she became much worse and apparently wasn't expected to live much longer. She was in her bed. Her children, their spouses, and Aunt P were all in her bedroom and had the door closed. The grandchildren and great-grandchildren were all there but they didn't want them in the bedroom. Someone said they were calling Aunt J so she could come. I asked if anyone had called my mother. At first no one answered me. Finally someone said they hadn't called her and didn't intend to because they didn't want her there. They didn't want to be around her. I was very upset by this. I understood them not wanting to be around her, but was still angry because Aunt H, Aunt P, and Aunt J are her sisters, too, and I thought it was disrespectful and selfish to not tell her or include her in this important time. I debated whether or not to call and tell her myself. I decided to call BJ and tell her and get her opinion as to whether we should let mother know ourselves."
"1458"	"(2006-11-18)"	"I was driving and pulled out, turning left, onto a completely empty four lane street. I thought it was very odd that there was absolutely no traffic on this street. I had barely gotten onto the street when I saw an elementary school marching band a few hundred feet in front of me. I quickly pulled off to the side of the road while I tried to figure out what to do. As I sat there I saw them march a few feet forward and then turn around and march the other direction. I moved my car forward a little bit thinking I might be able to get to the next intersection and turn right and hopefully be out of the path of the parade but that didn't work. The elementary school band met a high school marching band that was marching towards them. They integrated, the elementary school band turned around once again and then they all marched forward, and continued to do so, as they led the rest of the parade through the parade route. I am walking around a city with my husband [unknown in waking life] . We are talking about another man and neither of us can remember his name. It's someone that we have met casually, but that a lot of people know. We are standing at an intersection, there is a red brick building to my right, that is at least two or three stories tall. I hear a second-story window open. As I turned to see what was going on a man leaned out the window and started talking, but I'm not sure if he was talking to us or to someone else. It was the man we had just been talking about. Just seeing him made me smile, though I'm not sure why. As soon as I saw him I remembered his name. It was Danny Collins. [unknown in waking life.] We are not at our home and have some guests there for a social gathering. Danny and his girlfriend are there. My husband and I are sitting and talking to the two of them. Danny and I are sitting on the top of a picnic table, side-by-side yet facing each other. I have my legs up, my arms resting on my knees and my chin resting on my arms. Danny moves into the same position, which puts our faces right next to each other. After sitting this way for a little bit he whispers something to me. I try not to react so my husband or his girlfriend will not realize that Danny whispered something to me, though it practically took my breath away. It was something very romantic and loving. I wasn't surprised as this seems to be something that we do whenever we get the chance. I have the feeling that our intention is to be together at some point in the future. The party is now over and my husband and I are inside. I look out the window and see that we have left all of the decorative lights on. They looked like outdoor Christmas lights. There was something else we left on as well, maybe a water fountain. He said he would go back out and turn everything off. When he got back inside I was already in bed. He joined me and wanted to be intimate but I had no desire to be with him. I could only think about Danny. I told my husband no. He wasn't very happy about that, but I just didn't feel like I could be intimate with him when I felt the way I did about Danny."
"1459"	"(2006-11-18)"	"Myself and two other women were walking down a very dark street to go to work. I was thinking that the company should be responsible for having some kind of lights along the outside of the building. They would be held responsible if anything happened to an employee out here because of the lack of lighting. We could hardly see where we were walking or where the entry door was and I was feeling very uneasy. As soon as we got inside we realized something very bad was going on. There were men inside with guns. The employees that were in there when we arrived had tried to hide. Some of them didn't seem very well hidden and I was concerned that they would be found. This area was very well lit. One person was laying in a prone position on the floor, totally wrapped up in a tarp. But they wrapped the tarp fairly snugly around themselves so the men with gun could easily see it was a body in the tarp. There was roll of some type of fabric or material lying close to that person. Myself and one other person laid down on the floor and tried to cover ourselves with that fabric, only unrolling as much as we needed to so we would be covered. We laid close together and close to the roll in an effort to disguise our bodies. Now I am in a dark corner of another area. I am once again lying on the floor and trying to cover myself with some type of material that is somewhat rolled up, but mostly just piled on the floor. It was heavy and awkward and I found it very difficult to cover myself. Sheila G came up and laid down next to me and tried to pull some of this material away from me to cover herself. She was able to cover herself completely but it left me exposed. When I tried to recover myself she started struggling with me to keep herself covered. I found myself getting angry with her."

"1461"	"(2006-11-23)"	"I was at a place that I can best describe as a castle, and home of royalty, with a large group of people. The only one I can identify is Susan J. Several of us, I'm not sure if it was the entire group or not, were in a very large open room. I don't think there is any furniture in the room or anything like that. Along one of the side walls, a long wall, there is a drapery hanging from the ceiling about six feet into the room, not directly along the wall. It is there as a room partition of sorts and runs the entire length of the wall. We are all on the floor with a few feet between each of us, facing the curtain. We are on knees putting shoes into a compartment under the floor. We have been told that we can keep as many pair of shoes as we are able to fit into our compartment. This will be good for me because I am very good at maximizing space usage by the way I fit items into it. I quickly figure out the best way to place the shoes in the compartment so I can keep as many as possible. The floor is carpeted and there is no visible opening to the compartment. We had to feel for a soft spot in the carpet to identify where the opening was. Then we just had to push the shoes against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through into the compartment. We were able to reach our hand through as well to place the shoes the way we wanted them in the compartment. It didn't make a hole or any kind of opening in the carpet because each time we had to do the same thing again, just press against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through. For some reason it was more difficult some times than others. The best way I can describe it is how a ghost would be depicted walking through a wall."
"1462"	"(2006-11-24)"	"I was in St. Joe. There were five family members there, including myself. Mother and Daddy were two of them, but I don't know who the other two were. I suggested we go for a bike ride, suggesting that we ride around the block like we used to do. They weren't sure what I meant, because we're out in the country so I explain to them that I mean going right down SR46, take the first right across Route 1, take the next right up the road alongside the high school, the next right across the road in front of the high school and then another right back down SR46. As we were getting the bikes down from where Daddy had hung them in the garage I realized we didn't have five bikes. I didn't want Mother to have an excuse not to go so I suggested that we borrow some from the neighbors. Unlike in waking life, the neighbor's house was very close to ours, like city homes are. Their bikes were stored in a very run down shack behind their house. We borrowed two bikes from them. As we got on the bikes someone started out left going up SR46. I started to object because I didn't want to start out going uphill but decided not to say anything."
"1463"	"(2006-11-24)"	"I was in a restaurant attending a special dating event. Everyone there was on a blind date. All of the men were bald, to varying degrees. At one point in the evening they all stopped what they were doing, pulled out hairpieces and put them on. After a few minutes they took them back off and put them away again. I asked the man I was with what that was all about. I don't remember what he said but I remember thinking that it was similar to the fact that Catholic women always used to wear something on their head when entering the church. I was also thinking about the fact that so many men are uncomfortable with baldness because they feel less attractive, but I see nothing unattractive about it all."
"1464"	"(2006-11-25)"	"A football game party for DDSI customers. Ten or twelve people I've never met before show up and only one DDSI customer. We're watching the game in a small upstairs room of my home, where my home office is in waking life. As you face inside the room, the TV is sitting at an angle in the far right corner. I have refreshments set up on a card table in the far left corner. I have a loveseat between the two of those and a sofa along the left wall. I have a few other chairs and a few very small ottoman type stools that a couple of men are sitting on. Someone asks me about a bathroom and I tell them that the one across the hall is being used but that there is one downstairs. I realize that I don't mention the master bathroom but then think that I don't really want people to use my private bathroom anyway. I don't have a master bathroom in waking life. The one customer who does come is a brand new franchise owner. Her business is getting off to a very strong start. She is telling me about some of her successes and sales that she closed. She is very excited. I had come across an old-fashioned wooden wheelbarrow and had sent that to her as a gift. She said that she received and was very excited about and likes it very much. She thanked me for it. I had put some kind of ad in a newspaper about this party, which is why all of these strangers showed up. They were people who enjoy football parties but don't have groups of friends of their own to have parties with. I realized I didn't have the TV turned on yet and it was a couple of minutes past kick-off. I turned the TV on and wasn't sure if there was a problem with the TV or if I just had the wrong channel. The front of the TV had a channel knob like an old-fashioned TV. I wondered out loud if it wasn't supposed to be set on a certain channel because of my cable service. I started turning it to see if I could find the game. One of the men was making some wisecracks about this. I finally told him that he could sit there and be critical or he could try to help. So then he tells me what channel his TV needs to be set on because of cable service. Just as he said that I see a place on the knob that says CBS and realize that is for the cable service. I turn the knob to that and then use the remote to turn to the channel that the game is on. I make a comment that of course I should have tried the channel that said CBS since that stands for Comcast Broadcasting Service."

"1466"	"(2006-11-27)"	"I am at an SAID conference. There is an square overhead tent set up outdoors, supported with just four corner poles. Two adjacent poles are not completely upright and causing a problem, though I don't know why they aren't upright. I'm trying to fix one of them while someone else is trying to fix the other. Kendall B is there. He might be the one trying to help me fix the poles. There are tables set up under the tent to hold books and products that we are selling. There are six tables set up but divided into two sets. Each set of three tables are set up in a U shape with the bottom of the U being in the center of the tent and sitting directly next to each other. The tables don't have that many things on them, I think because it is near the end of conference and this is all that is left. The books that are left have been set in small piles. I'm talking to Kendall B, pointing to his books and telling him that I'm going to spread them out. We are now inside the hotel in a fairly small sitting area with a couple of sofas and a few stuffed chairs and side tables. There is one or more bar areas. I am trying to pack up the things that are left to either ship back or to take back. There is a pile of things that people have either already paid for and have not picked up or asked us to hold for them to come back later and pay and pick them. We agreed to do this as a service to people but also because we want to get as much revenue as possible. One of the bars has a lot of miscellaneous items sitting on it, pencils, books, software boxes, etc. As we're trying to pack up and get everything cleaned up and put away I mention to someone that we need to make sure we don't miss that bar. I has asked someone specifically to get both the software from that bar as well as some books that were left in another area and asked them to make sure they grab all of them. I wanted to make sure we didn't leave them. Jackie L had apparently been sleeping in another area because there are some gold sheets with a pattern to them. The pattern looks like a checkerboard. Some squares are satin-looking and some matte. They are laying on a something that is very close to the floor, maybe a mattress lying on the floor. There is also a pair of gold pajamas laying there. I realized that they belonged to her so I left them there for her to take care of. I go out into the hallway. It's not a long hallway like you would see in a hotel. It's almost more like a foyer to a suite of rooms. I'm looking for Kendall B because I wanted to ask him something. More than once I walk by the doorway of what I think is his room but I'm hesitant to knock and bother him. One time I see him walking around in the room. I go back to the sitting room and eventually he comes into that room. I ask him about his books that are left there."

A man dies because he is gay and my parents are in some way responsible for or involved in his death. I realize that Randy M is this man's son. Randy M doesn't know that my parents are involved. I'm afraid for Randy M's safety because I'm not sure what would happen if my parents find out that the man was Randy M's father. I wonder if Randy M is also gay. I learn something else about Randy M that causes me to not want to see him again. I have a bedroom suite in the home. The doors leading into my suite from the rest of the house is a set of French doors. I went into my suite, closing and locking the doors behind me so Randy M can't come in. It is very odd the way they lock. There is a small gap between the vertical edges of the doors. Most doors fit together snugly at the vertical edges. But with these doors, the locking mechanism is in this gap and you have to reach in the gap and push the locking mechanism in on both doors to lock them. I do that and go into another room of my suite. There is also one French door there. I'm hurrying. Maybe I'm expecting Randy M and want to get the doors locked quickly. Or maybe I don't want my parents to see me with Randy M. The single French door locks the same as the other one and I lock it. There is also a door between those two rooms of the suite. It's not a French door but has a similar kind of locking mechanism. Randy M shows up and just walks in through the single French door. I'm surprised and frustrated. I realize that I must not have actually locked that door. I must not have been careful enough to make sure it was locked. I tell him that I don't want him there or that I don't want to see him right now. I ask him to leave. He refuses. I have a single bed in that room. It looks as though there are no bed linens on it. In another room in my suite is a double bed. I wonder why, when I let him spend the night, we always share this single bed rather than the double in the other room. My father comes into the suite and is talking to Randy M. My older sister has never allowed me into her suite. She comes into my room and sneaks me away while they are talking. She tells me that I can go into her suite because Randy M will never find me there. There is a hidden staircase that leads from my suite up to her suite. The walls of the staircase are white. It has white carpeting. There are several flights of steps that lead up to her room. Each flight of steps is only about five or six steps. So, there are six steps, you turn to the right and go up another six steps, turn to the right and go up another six steps, etc. There is also a handrail attached to the wall to the right of these steps. My sister tells me to hurry up to her suite, though she doesn't go up with me. I'm rushing up the steps to get to her room and hide. I know he won't find me because he will never find the opening to these steps."

"1474"	"(2006-12-04)"	"Matthew and I were scheduled to help with a religious education class one Sunday morning at St. Joe. We were running late. He was driving too fast. We were supposed to be at Bill W and Emma W's house. Because he was driving too fast he missed the driveway when I pointed it out. He quickly pulled into another driveway to turn around. Just on the other side of that driveway there was a sharp curve to the right in the road. Out of frustration I told him that was a great place to decide to turn around because you couldn't see if there was any traffic coming from the other direction. Once he had pulled in and then backed up just a bit I could see that it was clear so I didn't worry about it anymore. Once he got back on the road he was still driving too fast and missed the W's driveway again. He did this four times. The fourth time he caught himself soon enough that he slammed on the brakes and just backed up enough that he could get into the driveway. As soon as we pulled in and parked we quickly started to get out of the car. Daddy came walking out of the house toward us. He was walking pretty quickly and saying something about us being late. Before he even finished what he was saying he realized that I was already upset about being late and decided not to say anything else. We went inside. There was a group of people doing laundry and we were supposed to be helping them. We walked over and they explained what we were supposed to be doing. There were two things that were to be sorted from everything else. Mother came up and helped also. After just a few minutes, we were finished. Matthew went over and sat down in a folding chair to wait to hear what we were supposed to do next. I was talking to Mother and Bev. Bev asked me if I was going to use the bathroom and I said yes. She decided to come with me. When we came back there was a woman sitting in a folding chair. There was one or two full trash bags tied shut and sitting on the floor. We realized that they were full of wet laundry. She was telling us that today we were just washing all of the laundry and that we were going to come back in a week and dry it all. I thought that was a very bad idea because some of it would be partially dry and really wrinkled, colors of some clothes may run onto some of the other clothes, it would smell bad from sitting wet all week. I was tempted to offer to take it all home with me and dry it all myself."
"1475"	"(2006-12-05)"	"I was taking an adult education class at ECHS. There were so many people around, as though high school classes were in session. It was a mix of adults and high school students. I attended my first class. There were two children in the class, maybe ten years old. It turned out that their mothers had sent them to that class to take notes for them because they were attending a different class. A schedule conflict had prevented them from being able to take both classes that they wanted to take. Instead of missing one, they sent their sons to take notes at one of them. By the end of the class I had decided that I was not going to enjoy the class at all. I didn't feel that I was going to get anything out of it. I decided to try to get into a different class. After the class was dismissed I was walking through the hall and overheard some people talking about one of the other classes. It sounded interesting so I decided to try to get into it. I walk up two flights of steps in a stairwell. There are three female students walking in front of me. They are all three significantly overweight, walking side-by-side, and walking very slowly. One of them tells the other two that they need to walk faster because I am behind them. I say that they don't need to, that I'm fine. When we get to the top I follow them through the door. We walk through a small room or a hallway. We arrive at the section of the school where I wanted to be. I tell them that I need to follow them anyway or I would likely get lost. One of them asked me the last time I was at the school and was able to walk around without getting lost. I told them it was thirty years ago, in 1975, when I graduated. They looked at me incredulously. I don't know if they couldn't believe that I had gone to school there, that I had gone there thirty years ago, or if they had never even considered the fact that the school had been there that long. I was thinking about how much the school at changed. They have added on numerous times and done major remodels. As we continued to walk I finally figured out where I was and walked away from them. I headed for the front of the school where the office was. I was sitting in a classroom next to a woman who was talking and carrying on. I was thinking that being in a class with her could be very trying, especially if I ended up sitting next to her because she would be very distracting. She talked all the time, even when the instructor was talking."
"1476"	"(2006-12-07)"	"I was in Bill C's office, sitting across from him at his desk. It wasn't a tense conversation but certainly very reserved. He said something about it being a long time and I responded that yes it has been about a year and a half. I was wondering why he had asked me to come and meet with him. I was also feeling surprised at myself for agreeing to come. I wished he would just quit stalling and tell me why he had asked me there. It felt like he was avoiding telling me because he wasn't sure how I would react. He continues to make small talk, still being very reserved and not smiling much if at all. When he does smile it is barely a smile. Bryan N comes into Bill's office. I don't know if he realizes that I am in there or not. But he comes in anyway to ask Bill C something. Yet, it doesn't seem like they speak at all. Because of something Bill C says I finally realize that he has asked me here to ask me to come back to work for him. I'm thinking about the fact that I want absolutely nothing to do with Bryan N but that I also don't think I could come back because of the way things were the last time but also because I don't think they would be any different if I came back. I doubt that Bill C would respect me or my abilities any more this time than he did the last. But I don't think any of the problems would change. He was walking around the office as he was talking to me. For the first time since I arrived I noticed his hair when he turned his back to me. He had let it grow very long. It came just below the collar of his shirt. It was black, with no grey and very curly, with all of it hanging in small curls. I thought it looked very odd, I didn't like it at all. I couldn't believe that he had wanted to do that or that he liked it, or that Jane C liked it. He finally said something to me about it. When he got very close to me, and was facing me, I realized that it was a wig because I could see part of the cap across his forehead. I told him that. He said something about his hair becoming even thinner. To me that just isn't a big deal, even though I know it is to men who are balding. I just don't think balding men are any less attractive. He said that's why he was wearing this wig. He took it off and I told him that I thought he looked so much better without it. He left off. There are two other women who come into his office and then a third comes in. All three are dressed very professionally in business suits. Two of them are my age or maybe even older. One is a younger, maybe in her mid to late 30's. I'm very surprised that he hired these three women, especially since they all three appear to be very capable professionally, to sell and conduct his training. Then I see two very young women leave the office and find out they are employed there as well. I think to myself that they seem more like the type of women I would expect Bill C to hire. They are both very dressed very provocatively and outrageously. One is wearing an animal print outfit. The skirt is so short it just barely covers her bottom. The other one is dressed in black leather. She is wearing something that looks something like a pair of shorts but the bottom hem doesn't even come to the bottom of her buttocks. At least two or three inches of her buttocks are uncovered and she is aware of this. It's intentional. I think it's outrageous. I look at the other three women with this questioning look of disbelief. They give me a look that says, I know. Can you believe it? I say something to Bill C. He says that he doesn't think it's a problem. I try to explain to him that they represent him and his company and ask if that's the kind of impression he wants people to get about him and the company. I ask him if he isn't at all concerned about what that is doing to his reputation. I tell him that it is absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable in a business office, in any professional environment but especially in his business. There are now about a dozen women in the office. I say something to one of them about her shoes. She, and the others, seem glad to hear whatever it is that I say, finding it to be useful professional advice. Bill C suggests that I take them all back to the training room and talk to them about things like that. I don't have a lot of time but I tell him that I will be happy to go back and share a few things with them about shoes. That won't take long but they are very important to a woman's professional appearance. I followed Bill C back to the training room and I'm feeling butterflies in my stomach because I haven't been there since I left the company. I know that he has made a lot of changes to the office since then. As we're walking I'm thinking about various dreams that I've had about the office over the last year and half. At the end of a long hallway he led me into a training room through a doorway to our right. It's a very small room. I look around, surprised that it's a training room. It's pretty messy and I don't see any chairs or tables. At the back of that room there is another door, along the left wall. He goes through that door so I follow him and realize that it leads to another training room. Apparently the second doorway is one that the trainers use to go back and forth between the two rooms. It has another entrance for clients. I don't know why he didn't take me in that door. It's a much larger room but it is also a mess. There are no tables and chairs set up for training and there are boxes and stuff sitting everywhere. It looks like they are using it as a storage room. Women start coming in and finding places to sit. Now, Lisa U is there. I suggested we do the presentation together and she said that was fine. After I said I wondered how we do it together given that it was all impromptu. I suggested she just chime in whenever she had anything to add. She was sitting in a chair to my left, leaned over resting her elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands. She nodded yes and said that was fine. I decided that I would do this by talking about the shoes that each of the women attending had on and discuss why they were or were not appropriate for business. So I told Lisa U we would just alternate. I would discuss a pair and then she could discuss a pair, etc. Now there are easily thirty or more women there. It appears as though there are a row of three rooms that are each connected to the other by a doorway just slightly wider than a normal doorway would be. The women have taken their chairs and lined them around the walls of each room. We're having to go through each room as we talk so all of the women can hear what we're saying and see the shoe we're talking about. I ask the first woman to my right in the main room to hand me one of her shoes. I decided to have her pass the shoe around for each woman in all three rooms to look at it. This first shoe was unusual so I told Lisa U she was welcome to do the first one because I knew she would have no problem coming up with something. After just a short time Lisa U had to leave. I realized it was taking a long time because we were passing each shoe around. I didn't want to be there much longer and I wanted to get this over, even though the women seemed to be enjoying it and they were giving me the impression that they were learning something. After we had done the first few pairs I started skipping some women's shoes if they were very similar to a pair we had already discussed. I also thought that doing it this way was creating too much downtime. Quite a few women had to leave early, so there were a lot fewer there. I asked them all to move their chairs into the one largest room, in rows, so they could all fit in one room. One of the shoes I discussed was black with about a two-inch heal. It had few rhinestones in different colors on the top, placed to create a very subtle and tasteful design. I told the women that this was one of my favorites so far because it was very professional yet the rhinestones set it a part a bit and gave it a little style. However, it was also very dirty so I emphasized the importance of taking care of their shoes and how dirty shoes can impact the impression someone gets about you. People get the impression that you don't take care of things or that you don't care about impressions or about details and that kind of thing. One of the shoes was a closed-toe flat with hardly any heel to it at all. I told them that my problem with it was that it would not be comfortable for very long if they spend a lot of time on their feet because it doesn't offer support for the legs and back. It would take a toll on your posture. Also your feet, legs, and back may start to feel tired or achy and that would take a toll on your mood or attitude, which in turn impacts your work, especially if you are interacting with other people. Another pair that I discussed was a dress thong with was also almost no heel. I told them that the same thing applied to this pair because of the lack of heel but that a thong of any kind was also way too casual and inappropriate for business attire. There was a closed-toe wedge that I showed and said that I particularly liked because the height of the heel gave it a more professional appearance. Because it was a wedge it would be very comfortable, unlike a regular high-heeled shoe, and not cause any of the foot, leg, or back discomfort that can be associated with high-heeled shoes. There was one that was a closed-toe wedge. It was two-toned, with the bottom half all around the shoe being brown and the upper half being tan or beige. It had some type of embellishment on the top of each shoe. It might have been a very small tassle or bow but I can't recall exactly. I held it up saying that it was also one of my favorites. I reminded them of the positives of a wedge-heel. I mentioned that closed-toes shoes are more professional than anything with an open-toe. But then I also mentioned that the style, with the two colors and the embellishment on top was also a positive. It provided a sense of style and implies creativity."
"1477"	"(2006-12-08)"	"I was living in one part of a huge home that almost seems like an old castle or mansion. The part that I was living in was more like a small suite, with two bedrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen, and bathroom. The rest of the house was haunted. There was a man who gave public tours of the home, talking about the hauntings and sightings. He would point out certain hot spots in the home where a particular type of sighting would occur on a regular basis. One of the hot spots was at the top of a staircase. If you stood facing the wall with the staircase leading down to your right, there was artwork hanging on the wall directly in front of you. If you paused there to look at the artwork, something that looked like smoke or steam would rise from the floor. It would rise about 6 feet from the floor and not spread out much wider than the average width of a person. It wasn't always noticeable to the person standing there but was clearly noticeable to anyone standing any distance away. This type of sighting appeared in several different locations and most other locations it was much heavier or more visible. Some people claimed to see ghostly people. Some of my family members were visiting so I took them on a tour and pointed out the hot spots. I was standing at the top of the staircase when that sighting occurred. I noticed it immediately and said, see? That's what I was talking about. Did you see it? At least some of them said they had. As we were moving about the home I started seeing numerous ghostly people. I was surprised because I had not seen them before. I was somewhat afraid but not terribly so. The way some of them looked made them more frightening. Some of the men were unshaven and dirty and dressed in worn and tattered clothing. They were more frightening. They were trying to get my attention because they wanted something from me. One of them walked into me. I had never had that happen before. Because it hadn't happened to me before I didn't know what to do and he was able to become part of me. After a few minutes I was able to do something that forced him out. Once I did that, I was able to prevent others from it when they tried. This upset some of them and that made me a little more afraid. Aunt H appeared. I was happily surprised to see her and spoke with her. She gave me a bouquet of pink and purple silk flowers. Each bloom was similar to a Hibiscus bloom. The bouquet also had some stems of green silk leaves. Only one other member of my family could see any of these ghosts, but even they couldn't see Aunt H. I didn't tell them who I was talking with because I wasn't sure how some of them might react if they knew one of the ghosts. I was particularly concerned how Mother might react. At the same time I seemed to be having flashbacks of Aunt H and Aunt P when they were a bit younger, maybe 30 years ago. Aunt H will turn 90 in just over two months. I am talking to my family and there is an empty bud vase sitting on a counter or high-top piece of furniture, in front of me. Suddenly, and one at a time, these same pink and purple flowers come shooting out of the top of the vase one at a time. As they reach a peak in the air they begin to fall and as they do I catch them. I immediately say, that's Aunt H. She wants to let Mother know that she is here. I tell her to slow down because I'm having trouble catching each flower as fast as they are coming out of the vase. I'm catching them with my right hand and trying to put them in my left hand by the stem as I catch each one. I don't think my family wants to believe me but this is such an unusual thing, and they can tell I am quite surprised by the event myself, that I think they are convinced that I'm telling them the truth. The other ghosts are now being much more aggressive in trying to enter my body. Along one wall in the kitchen is a small settee. A very rough looking man is sitting on the settee. He is actually more slouched, laying haphazardly at a diagonal with one leg outstretched and the foot pointing upward and the other leg bent near the edge of the settee with the foot flat against the floor. He is looking at me as though he is upset with me. I just look away and try to ignore him. There were ten or twelve ghosts wandering around at once at this point. I noticed the former owner of the home, the man who had built it. He had been deceased for many, many years, maybe even close to one hundred years. I immediately approached him as I was excited to see him. I didn't know anything about him but I thought he would really enjoy seeing his home again. I introduced myself, told him I was living there and asked if I could walk around the home and property with him. He seemed very warm and friendly and immediately welcomed my offer to walk with him. As we walked around I pointed out where I was living. He seemed to like that someone had created this small suite in the home and that someone was living here. He also appreciated that it had been so well cared-for. I could tell a lot of love and care had gone into creating this home. I pointed out some particular things that had been done in an attempt to preserve them and slight changes that had to be made at times to be able to preserve them. He nodded yes with interest as I pointed this out. Sometimes he nod seemed more one of understanding and approval. I think he could tell that there were times that I didn't like alterations that were made even though someone had told me they had to be done for preservation. At those times I felt that his nod was more intended to help me feel okay about the alterations. We took a very unusual staircase, I can't recall if we were going up or down. It was not quite spiral but somewhat and it had a very unusual banister. It didn't seem to be made of wood or wrought-iron. I don't know what it was made of. It was dark green in color and had a somewhat ornate design in each piece. He told me about a special area that he had created for his wife on one of the upper floors. It was very well-lit and light-colored in its d_cor. I could tell he was very happy to have done that for his wife, pleased with how it turned out, and was reminiscing about how much she had enjoyed it. I told some of my family about this. We went outside to walk the grounds. I was a bit more apprehensive about this as I wasn't sure how he would feel about the changes that had been made to the landscaping. It turned out I was right to be apprehensive. He wasn't angry, but he was clearly sad about some of the changes. There were a lot of adult trees. These were young trees that he had planted that had been allowed to grow to maturity. He was grateful for that. I was walked beneath the trees on what appeared to be a worn path from others walking there, I would occasionally bend over to try to pull up things that I knew shouldn't be growing there. I would notice a sad smile on his face, appreciating my respect for and efforts to restore the original beauty of the landscaping and the landscaping plan he had so thoughtfully and carefully put into place. There was a man sitting in a lawn lounge chair not too far from us but we both decided to ignore him and keep walking. It felt like a violation of the landscape for that man to be sitting in such a chair and to be sitting where he was.  "
"1478"	"(2006-12-09)"	"I was living in a townhouse that looked similar to mine in waking life except that there were only two townhomes to a building. There was a bit of a side yard between each building, making it look more like a neighborhood of houses. The townhomes also had fairly large backyards that weren't that wide but they were fairly deep. I was outside working in my flowerbed behind the building and I noticed that someone new had moved into the building to my left. It was a young black woman. She was very excited to be there, especially to have a yard and flowerbeds that she could work in. She was also working in her flower beds. She had really thought out what she wanted to do with them, went to a store and bought the things she needed. I walked over to introduce myself and tell her that I liked what she was doing with her flower beds. I was also wondering if I could do something similar without looking like I was just copying what she was doing. I didn't think either one of us would be too happy with me just copying her. She had started by working the dirt really well. It was a beautiful dark brown, well-tilled and ready for planting. She had also bought an edging that looked just like the outside of the building. I thought that was kind of cool and wondered where she had found it, though I knew it wasn't my style. I just didn't know such a thing was available. I think she had a friend helping her and something was said or done that brought attention to a shed in the backyard. For the first time I realized that the shed in my own backyard was partially mine to use. Each building had a shed about midway back that was divided in half and each half was to be used by the tenant of that half of the townhome. I went back to mine and realized my house key worked to unlock my half of the shed. When I opened it I saw that it was full of folding chairs. The previous tenant and hung some wooden racks, for lack of a better description, so they could store all of these chairs in there by hanging them. There were easily 50 chairs hanging in there. There were five rows along the inside wall of the shed with about ten chairs to each row. I don't know who was around but I asked if anyone could use some folding chairs. I don't know if the previous tenant had forgotten them or had knowingly just left them there. They obviously didn't want them because I've been living there for nearly 10 years. Later I'm in the shed with a man I know and the chairs are no longer in there. The floor has a few joists but no other flooring. The dirt can be seen through the joists. There are also so beams running across the top of the shed, with an open space between the beams and the ceiling. We notice some wood planks just laying across these beams and the man I am with begins to pull them down. I mention that they might be good to use to create a floor in the shed, nailing them to the existing joists. He agrees that would work well. I was talking to the new neighbor about living in these buildings because she was somewhat concerned about sharing a wall with neighbors. I told her it had rarely been a problem for me but said something about Wanda U and her family that share my building. We were laughing a bit. At this point it was more like I was observing myself in the dream because I was watching myself talk with the new neighbor about Wanda U and her family and suddenly saw that Wanda U was standing there talking with us at the same time. It made me feel uncomfortable. Even though it didn't seem to be bothering Wanda U at all, maybe she had even started it, it still made me uncomfortable. We went back to talking about flowerbeds. I realized that I had not been to my flowerbed, or flower garden, that was near the shed in quite some time. I keep forgetting that it is even there. I think about other times that I have had this same or a very similar experience."
"1479"	"(2006-12-09)"	"I was working with a group of people on an outdoor project of some type. I was in a helicopter with one of the men I was working with. He was piloting the helicopter. Another man we were working with was piloting another helicopter at the same time. The two helicopters got very close to each other midair so the two pilots could reach out a window for one to hand the other something. We were now all in the basement of my birth home. We were very tired from whatever we had been working on and were lying on the sofas, resting. Quite a few members of my family were upstairs baking cookies and making gingerbread houses. One of the houses had been put together and was sitting on a table in the basement but it had not yet been decorated. After a little while, I decided to get up and work on decorating the gingerbread house that was sitting down there. I began by running white icing along all of the wall and ceiling joints. The man I had been in the helicopter with got up and decided to help me. I was surprised that he wanted to do this."
"1480"	"(2006-12-09)"	"I was working in a restaurant that served alcohol. All of the waitresses had one particular employee assigned to help them but I don't know what they did to help. I was one of those assigned to a waitress. I only worked when she did. Part of my pay was a percentage of her tips. So anything I did to help her get better tips helped me as well. She was involved in some bad situation, or with someone who was a bad influence, and authorities came to the restaurant to question her during our shift. They asked her for proof of something. She was going through her wallet but wasn't able to find what she needed or what they were looking for so she had to leave with them. Since she had to leave my shift was over as well. We didn't process her tips for our shift that day before she left. They were all in a heavy, glass, goblet-shaped water glass. There were some scraps of paper in there also. Mostly what was in there were paper money, though there was also a one-dollar coin and a couple of fifty-cent pieces. The dollar coin was much larger than in waking life, maybe even three or four times as large. I counted up her tips and took my 10% out, having two other employees watch while I did it so they could verify the amounts. I wondered if the employees who would be left there knew how to close at night but decided not to worry about it and go ahead and leave. As I was leaving I saw a manager coming in so I was reassured that it would be no problem. Directly outside the door a patron's car was parked. I walked along the driver's side of that car and around the back of it, while getting out my car keys, thinking that I was parked on the right side of that car. I looked up and realized that I was parked along the right side of the building."
"1481"	"(2006-12-10)"	"I was helping with landscaping in someone's front yard. The homeowner had hired a professional decorator to work in their home and that person was in charge of landscaping as well. Large, flat river rocks had been placed two or three feet out and all across the front of the house. At one end, someone had covered some of them, about three feet in width, with mulch. I thought that must be what needed to be done next so I continued covering the others with mulch. The decorator came out and told me that the mulch was supposed to have gone down first and then the river rocks. I apologized and said I would change it so I went about lifting all of the river rocks above the mulch and sitting them on top of it. I used my sleeve to wipe any remainder of mulch off of each rock. Gloria S was there and began helping me lift the river rocks above the mulch. She seemed aggravated at me for making this mistake. Somewhere along the line George Clooney was the decorator. He came out and we had a conversation about his plans for the yard."
"1482"	"(2006-12-10)"	"I had an appointment with Sister Toni. Before my appointment was over it was almost time for Mass. I told her I just had one other thing I would like to discuss with her briefly after Mass if possible. She said that was not a problem at all. We went to Mass in the chapel. Bryan N was there. I acted as though I didn't see him as I didn't want to interact with him in anyway. There are no kneelers in the chapel. When it came time in the Mass to kneel Bryan N sat down in his chair. When he saw the rest of us kneel on the floor he did the same. After Mass I stayed in the chapel waiting for him to leave, again so I wouldn't have to risk interacting with him in any way. I was getting impatient because he was waiting so long. He was the last one, besides me in the chapel. Sister Toni came in and he said something to her about meeting her somewhere to go someplace together. This made me very uncomfortable and a little bit upset, though I know I had no reason or right to be upset by this. It felt a bit as though she was taking sides or betraying me, which I know is ridiculous. I went back to her office to wait for her. Just outside her office she had a very small, enclosed, grassy area. I was looking out the window and noticed a path across the middle of the area that looked like it had been made by two tires very close together. The grass was completely gone and the dirt was slightly raised between the two tire tracks. It was only a few feet long so I thought this was very bizarre. There wasn't enough room for anything with tires to even be in there let alone wear such a path in the grass. Then I noticed something similar at one end of the area. I was going to ask her what happened to her grass. I sat and waited and saw her out in the main area doing something. She seemed to either be putting some things away from Mass or preparing for something else, maybe both. She finally saw me in my office and remembered that she had told me could talk a few more minutes after Mass. She said she would be right in. I kept waiting and waiting. I couldn't decided whether to keep waiting or to go ahead and leave. Most of the time I couldn't see her out there so I wasn't even sure she was still out there. I thought about just leaving a check on her desk but realized I wouldn't have another appointment scheduled then."
"1483"	"(2006-12-13)"	"I was working at WDF, making some phone calls. A new promotion had just been received by the franchise owners. I would be on the phone talking with someone and two more people would call and get my voice mail and leave messages. After this happened a number of times I finally told Al H that I might need help with some of the calls. I talked to a few new franchise owners, using a headset. As soon as they told me who they were I asked them to hold for just a second and I reached for my laptop to move it front of me so it would be easier for me to take down more information and more accurately. Then I would start by asking them for some basic information like contact information. I had written notes on post-it's about people I needed to call back. While I was on the phone Marcia N came up and grabbed some of them and I overheard her say, I'll just take some of these and return them. She also said something to the effect that I was obviously going to need help with this, implying something about my competence. She had not heard what I said to Al H. I didn't like it that she took the messages without asking me nor did I like what she said. If I was going to ask for help, I wanted to go through them and decide which ones I needed or wanted to call myself and which ones I was willing to turn over to someone else because the people were calling for a variety of reasons. Then Deena A came up and grabbed a bunch of them that I was going to need to go over with Al H. This bothered me even more. But, again, because I was on the phone at the time I couldn't stop her either. As soon as I got off the phone I went to both Marcia N and Deena A and told them I needed the messages back. They both seemed to get irritated with me. I said I just need to figure out where I am with all of these before anybody walks off with them. They were both so irritated and thought I didn't need them back or they thought I was up to something. I'm not sure what. I'm now sitting on the edge of a bed working. They bring all of the messages back and more toss them to me than hand them to me nicely. Some of them just land on the bed. They aren't in any kind of a neat pile and the post-its are different colors. Thankfully they were written on post-its or I'm sure some of them would have gotten lost going back and forth. I'm sitting on the bed trying to sort through them and decide to create an Excel sheet to type in who called, their phone number, date of the call, and a message about what needs to be done or if they left a message what their message was. After I did that I would be better able to determine how Marcia N and Deena A could best help."
"1484"	"(2006-12-13)"	"I am at Bill C's house. He has a three-year-old daughter and a twelve-year-old son. We are working on a project so I am staying at his house for a few days, a few nights. His daughter becomes ill. It's something unusual so at first they don't believe me when I tell them that I suspect something is wrong with her. He has a live-in nurse, and even she didn't take me too seriously when I first told her the little girl wasn't well. The nurse's room is in a different part of the house than mine, closer to the daughter's room. Whenever the daughter gets upset because she is feeling worse, I am the only person she wants much to do with. It seems that I am the only person who is able to calm and comfort her. One time she is telling me, as best a toddler can, that she had a sore on her genitals but that it had gone away. I'm not sure why, but I thought it was a blister. I picked her up to carry her to the nurse's room. As we were walking I told her that we needed to tell the nurse about it. She began to cry a little bit, very softly. I assured her that it was okay and that nothing was wrong. I tried to explain to her that the nurse needs to know these things so she can help her get better faster. She stopped crying. When we talked to the nurse she said it was normal for this illness and nothing to be concerned about. I took the daughter back to her bed and started to leave. She started again to cry softly. I walked back to her and asked her what was wrong. She said she didn't want me to leave. I told Bill C I would just move my things to her room and just stay in her room. I was concerned that I wouldn't get much work done this way, as I had been doing most of my work in my bedroom. But comforting the little girl was my first priority, and being there for her. I thought it was especially important since I was the one she seemed to want with her most often. Bill C had someone put a second bed in the daughter's room, parallel to each other. The two beds sat right next to each other with no space between them. Her bed is a little higher than mine. I'm standing there holding the little girl and rocking back and forth, from side to side, on my feet. I tried to get her to rest her head on my shoulder, by trying to gently guide it down to my shoulder while saying, it's okay. Just lay your head down and go to sleep. Her whole body tensed up, preventing me from lowering her head to my shoulder. She didn't want to sleep. I went back to the nurse's room and told her about this. That concerned the nurse. The nurse threw six or seven balls of different colors and sizes into an adjacent room, hoping the little girl would go after them. I didn't like this as it seemed to much like asking a dog to play fetch. The little girl immediately wanted me to let her down on the floor and she ran into the other room after the balls. She picked up a ball and ran to the doorway and threw it to me. Bill C was standing in the room where the balls were so I thought it was odd that she would throw them to me instead of to him. She did this with each of the balls. Apparently this alone was significant to the nurse but I don't know why. I'm holding her again, talking to her softly. Bill C comes up behind me and puts his arms around both of us. He leans his face in close to my right cheek and kissed me on the cheek. After that he doesn't move away, and whispers that he loves me. I think this is all bizarre. I pulled away to the left, as much as I could with his arms so snugly around us both, and asked him what he said, in a very low tone as I didn't want to further disturb his daughter by letting her know I was feeling bothered. He said the same thing again, still in a very soft whisper. Even though I couldn't hear him very clearly I was sure that is what he said. I put the little girl in bed and then I get in my own bed, laying in the middle. Bill C comes in and lays down next to me, so I move over just a little, not wanting him to think he was welcome there but more feeling forced to move over some. He decides that he is going to sleep in there too. I'm thinking that between the two of them I'm not going to get any sleep at all. Between the fact that I don't sleep well when someone else is in bed with me and my concern and caring for the little girl I was thinking that I wasn't going to get any sleep at all. Bill C is tossing and turning. I finally turn to my left to face him and ask him what the problem is, why he is being so restless. He tells me that it is just very hard to be in bed with someone that you want to make love to and not be able to. He is implying that he can't because of his daughter, not because of a wife. I'm thinking that I don't want to get involved with him that way. He is laying on his back so I had to lean over the top of him and put my face pretty close to his so I can hear him. When he finishes we kiss. I'd like to think I didn't initiate it but it seems as though I did. I hear the little girl begin to cry softly. I turn back to her and ask her what is wrong. She says that she wants me to sleep with her. At first I'm thinking that I can't do much more, but I tell her I will move closer to her. I move to the edge of my bed where I can lay on my left side and put my right hand on her. This comforts her and she goes back to sleep. Bill C is still in my bed and moves closer to me. He is laying on his left side as well. I occasionally feel his body touch my lower back when he moves in his sleep. I know he isn't doing it intentionally. The next day I decide to help clean up after a meal. I end up doing a bunch of dishes by hand, and by myself. I ask him a couple of times why he isn't helping. He makes some off-handed remark about not needing to or there being no reason for him to help. He thinks it is perfectly fine for me to be doing this and doing it alone because of gender. I find this very frustrating but I feel that I can't say too much because I work for him. I push it a couple of times by asking him again. He knows I'm getting more upset that he isn't helping but it doesn't change anything. He still makes no effort to help. His son walks through the room, coming in one door and out another. He says something as he walks through. After he's gone I ask Bill C about what he said. At the time I knew what he said but I can't recall now. I don't know what I asked or why. I am drying some glasses with a dish towel. There are some coffee cups, not coffee mugs. They have something in them that wasn't a drink. It reminds me of dried jell-o but the colors are blue and yellow. I'm trying to get it out of the cups and then I continue washing and drying glasses."

"1490"	"(2006-12-21)"	"There was something going on in my home that there was someone else there. I don't know how many people were there, not alot but I think more than one. I was standing in the hallway, leaning with my back against the wall, facing my office door. I saw Ben D coming up the steps and was shocked to see him there. He looked up at me with his familiar huge smile as he climbed the steps. I stood there frozen, not even being able to imagine why he was there. As he reached the landing, without saying a word he approached me, put his arms around me and began to kiss me. I reciprocated. I put both hands up and began to run them along the smooth skin of his head, quickly realizing that he was letting his hair grow. About that time he pulled slightly away and told me that he had been thinking about letting his hair grow back and told me why. I told him I think he is very handsome the way he is but I'm sure he would be just as handsome if he let his hair grow back. I could see it was very short, fairly thin, and completely gray, not the longer, thick, black hair I recalled from the picture he had once shown me. As we continued to kiss he stopped for a moment again and said something about someone seeing us. I took his hand and led him across the hallway into my bedroom, asking with a smile if this would be more comfortable. He smiled and excitedly said absolutely. He removed just his shirt and lied down on his back. I didn't remove any of my clothing but lied down next to him on my left side. He once again put his arms around me and we continued to kiss. He wanted to make love but I wasn't sure what I wanted. I told him to wait just a minute while I went to the bathroom. I was using the bathroom and he came walking in. I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable and said something to him. He knew he had made me uncomfortable by coming in the bathroom while I was using it. Rather than apologizing and leaving he stood in front of me talking about why this should be perfectly fine with me, because it's a perfectly normal human function. Nothing he said made me feel any more okay with it. We decided to go out in public, a few places, but I'm not sure where. One place seemed to be church, but not for a service. Before we left he had asked me to put something in my handbag for him and I told him I couldn't. I think the truth is that for some reason I didn't want to and I think he suspected this. So he had an off-white bag, the best I can describe it is what some would call a ""man bag,"" that he carried with him under his arm, even though it appeared to have two handles. One other time while we were out he made some comment about the bag, insinuating that he wished I would have helped him so he wouldn't have to be carrying it with him. I didn't respond. While we were out he finally told me why he was there. He had been diagnosed with a rare, untreatable, terminal illness. The doctors had given him about three months to live and he wanted to spend those three months here. My first reaction was extreme sadness and a desire to do whatever I could for him, and to help him with whatever he wanted. I suppose the fact that he would never do this in waking life didn't even occur to me in the dream. We were back at my home, though it now looks very different than my waking life home. It reminds me more of an old Victorian home, with lots of beautiful, dark wood throughout each of its large rooms. Someone I lived with was talking about others who lived there and how messy they were, leaving their things lying about. She said something about wishing there weren't so many people living there. As she said that I saw Ben D's luggage sitting on the floor in a corner. There was quite a bit since he had hoped to be staying. At first I wondered how my roommate was going to take this news. But I quickly realized that she is a very, kind and compassionate person and would be accepting of the idea with no ill feelings. Somewhere through this I was thinking about how sad it would be to not see him at conference anymore."
"1491"	"(2006-12-24)"	"Football stadium, one long side of it was for the Colts and the other long side of it had nothing to do with football. I was attending an event on the non-football side, not in the city where I live, and had a sleeping room on the 14th floor. Macy F was also attending but had her own room on a lower floor. We were both frustrated by something at the event. I found a solution and shared it with her but she either didn't like it or didn't believe me. There was a male child who wanted to experience some type of parachute thing there. The cords of the parachute were laced through a slit in a cement floor, part of the building, for safety and came together at the end, held together by a yellow, metal piece that had a hook on the other end of it. The cords went in one end and the hook was on the other. The child was floating in the air attached to this parachute. Alan K and another man were standing beneath the cement floor holding the ends of the cords just above the yellow piece to try to assure that the child did not go off into the air. I was concerned that if the wind was too strong they might lose their grip so I hooked the yellow, metal piece to a hook on the bottom side of the cement floor. When the child was back down and unattached the two men saw what I had done and became very angry. They said they could have gotten injured because I did that. I was upset with them, thinking that they seemed to be more concerned about themselves than about this child. I got lost on my way to my room and found myself on the far other side of the stadium, the football side. I was feeling nervous and upset about being lost and about having gotten so far from where I needed to be. I asked someone for directions to get back and they didn't seem to know what I was talking about, but gave me directions anyway. I tried to follow their directions but it didn't get me anywhere. Then I saw a woman and asked her. She didn't seem to know what I was talking about either. She didn't realize that there was another side to this building, and that it had a completely different purpose. We were looking out a row of very large single pane windows, larger than you would see at an airport terminal. The only thing visible was land. I don't know if it was just dirt, or grass, or some of both. There might have been some trees but I'm not sure. She said something to imply that she was having trouble believing me about their being another side to this building because all we could see from the windows was this land. I always took steps up to my room. The steps appeared to be in an area kind of like a stair well on it was about twice the size, maybe a bit larger, of a normal stairwell. There were two flights of steps, each facing opposite the other, between each floor. The bottom flight had an angled wall that rose about three or four feet higher than each step. It seems that I took these steps a number of times, but not always to get to my room, or at least they didn't always lead to my room."

"1494"	"(2006-12-25)"	"I decided to go for a bike ride and take a route that I had not ridden in awhile. I was going to return by taking a long country road that ended directly in front of my home. If I kept riding in the same direction as the road I would ride directly into my driveway. This is not all like my waking life home. As I was riding various country roads toward my home I would come to intersections. The first couple of times I slowed way down, almost stopping, before turning onto another road. At the final intersection, however, I didn't slow down at all. I decided I could maintain my speed and navigate the turns without incident. The first was a 90 degree right turn and then less than a undred a feet further ahead was a 90 degree left turn. I navigated both successfully without toppling my bicycle. The left turn put me on the long straight road that led to my house. As I road I came to a large mansion of a home that was being built. I thought about the fact that I had stopped there some months before and talked to the woman owner about a job as property manager. I would guess the woman owner to be somewhere around seventy years of age, with lovely, silver-grey hair. I decided to stop and see if she was there and follow up with her. The structure was not yet completely enclosed so I just walked in through an opening. I saw several construction workers and asked one if the owner was there. I had barely gotten the question out when she walked up. I reintroduced myself and told her I was there to follow up with her regarding our previous conversation. She didn't seem to remember me, but was willing to talk with me again because she was still looking for a property manager to help her finish the project and then perform various functions once the building was completed. There was another younger woman there as well. She had blonde hair and was thirty or forty years old. She was not there the last time and did most of the talking this time. In building this project, they had moved some important items from another property. One item was a very large, beautiful, ornate driveway arch that was made of cement. It was a very pale salmon color and looked very regal. They had also relocated an old cemetery that had contained six or so gravesites. When they relocated it they had not reburied the coffins, all of which looked like the 6 sided pine boxes that were once used for burials. Each looked very weathered and had a cross on top. They were a hundred or more years old and had historical significance. There was something else that they had moved, also of historical significance. They had not done anything with either of these sites because they were waiting to hear what they were required to do, both legally and according to historic preservation requirements. Before I went in to find the owner I had looked at both of these sites again. I found them fascinating and thought it would be quite a bit of fun to recreate or restore these two historically significant sites. When I was inside talking to the owner and her younger employee, I mentioned these two sites. The younger woman said they were likely not going to do anything else with them as they recently learned they were not required to do anything. My first thought that this was disrespectful, especially to the people whose remains were in the coffins. They were intending to just leave the coffins sitting above ground. I knew immediately that if I were to get the job I would try to convince the owner to do something with both of these sites that would be both respectful of the individuals buried but also respectful of the historical significance of the two sites. After we finished talking I got back on my bike and continued my ride home. I had not gone very far when I saw someone else was building a new home, but this one was being build right on the road, so the only way to continue down the road was to ride through the home. It was not fully enclosed yet. I apologized as I was riding through, though there was really no alternative other than to ride through the grass. I decided to stop and see if I might be able to get a part-time, temp job with the construction company. I was talking to the project manager as he and two other men were working. One of the men didn't seem very competent and I could tell by the way the other two looked at each other that they were frustrated with him. I reached up and helped with something they were doing that the third man didn't seem able to do. They seemed impressed that I knew what to do and was able to do it. I told them that I'm not afraid of power tools, have some working knowledge of this kind of work, and can handle small tasks like this. The project manager told the other man they should give me a chance so the other man pulled out a sheet of paper and looked at to see when they could use me. He said I could come in at 3:30 and work until twelve. At first I thought he meant 3:30 in the afternoon. Since it was just going to be five hours a day I decided it would be fine. Five hours a day doesn't fit with the twelve o'clock stop time. Then he clarified that he mean come in at 3:30 in the morning and work until 7 in the morning. I started to say that I couldn't do that but then quickly said okay, thinking that the experience would be good and since it was only part-time it would be okay. I asked him about clothing requirements. He told me that I would need to wear dark grey pants, something like Dockers and a dark red golf shirt. I knew this meant that I would need to go shopping that day so I would have the clothes I need to go to work in the morning. I thanked him and got back on my bike to continue my ride home. After riding a short distance I came upon another house being built in the road. A little later there was a spa type business that was partially built in the road and partially on both sides of the road. I didn't understand how it could be that I hadn't seen it there before as I had to take this road to get from my house to another road or street to go anywhere. This spa had been there for some time. It had numerous regular customers, several were there at that time. None of it was fully enclosed, so it was exposed to the elements. The part in the road looked like a very large spa tub. It had lounge chairs sitting all around it and employees checking in with the customers sitting there to see if they wanted or needed anything. All of the customers were wearing thick, white, terry-cloth robes like you would typically see in a spa. Two women got up and walked to a part of the spa that was to the right of the road, talking to each other as they walked. I wondered how expensive their services were and thought it would be nice to be able to come here on occasion. As I continued my ride home there were several other businesses built on the road. It didn't even cross my mind how people get to these places since they are all built in the road and there is no other road leading to any of them. Several times I thought it seemed to be a long ride home. I didn't remember the road being nearly this long. I kept looking off into the distance to reassure myself that I was going in the right direction. It never looked like I was but I knew I had to be because off in the distance looked like nothing but landscape and I knew the other end of the road ended at an intersection with a bunch of buildings around on all four corners of the intersection and branching out in every direction. There were also a number of times when it all felt like I had this exact same experience before. It was similar to when I dream something and realize that I had dreamt it before, though I wasn't thinking about it being a dream at the time."
"1495"	"(2006-12-25)"	"I was a medical surgical intern at a hospital. The cast of Grey's Anatomy were employees there as well. I had been given the assignment of leading a bypass operation on a child. The other interns were very upset that I had been given the assignment. Dr. Bailey told them that it had been given to me because she and the chief of surgery believed that I was the one most capable of it doing it successfully. The other interns didn't agree so they continued to be upset about it. There were two other surgeries in progress and I needed to wait for them to be completed before I could begin the one I was doing. I lined up my surgical team and did some other prep work, including reviewing the patient's medical records, while I was waiting. There were two male, resident doctors who were vying for my affection. I was somewhat attracted to both and was interested in each for different reasons, but I was unquestionably more interested in a relationship with one over the other. I knew I had to decide between the two and then let them both know what my decision was. I think I had been hesitating because I did like them both and enjoyed having both of them in my life, even if it was for different reasons. I just really didn't want to say goodbye to either one, but I did eventually decide to commit to the one that I knew was the right choice for me and then told them both about my decision. The one I chose wanted to rub it in to the other. I didn't like that. There was a heated discussion between a resident doctor and one or more of the other interns. It wasn't related to the surgery I was going to be doing. While I was waiting I went to look in on a patient that was seems to be there for someone else's surgery, as though we needed him to help us with treating someone else. It seems to be similar to being a plasma donor but it's more involved than that."

"1497"	"(2006-12-26)"	"I was working at ITI in Kimberli W's office. She wasn't supposed to be there that day but she was. I was still working at her desk and computer. She didn't seem to be doing anything though. I didn't know if she was going to be there all day or just part of the day. At lunch time she was going to run some personal errand and asked me if I wanted to go along. I just smiled and said no thank you. She seemed a bit put-off by that, though there was no reason for her to. She knows that I like to work through my lunch break and go home an hour earlier instead. She came back with what looked to be a white, plastic grocery bag. It had four plastic tumblers in it, each a different color. I would guess them to be 12oz size. The president of the school had called her into his office and wanted to chat with her about not using her time well. When she came back she was, of course, upset by this. We looked out the window and saw that the president had gone outside with another employee and was hitting baseballs. Kimberli W was going around talking with various people. A couple times I tried to say something to her but each time she interrupted and either spoke to me or to someone else. I was thinking that the next time I see him I might jokingly say something to him about not inviting me to play. My reason for doing this was an indirect way to try to point out that he had just spoken to Kimberli W about not using his time well then he went outside with another employee to hit baseballs. I wasn't upset just because it was Kimberli W. It was the principle that bothered me. I was going to ask Kimberli W if she wanted to dare me to say something to him knowing that when someone dares me to do something I normally take the dare. Before I had a chance to say anything he came back in. He came in to her office again. She and I were both there. Before she had a chance to say anything I told him that he didn't invite me to join him. He looked at me with a confused look. I told him that I saw him outside as I pointed toward the window. He half-smiled. I told him I played the catcher position for about 6 years on a women's softball team and I was pretty good at it. I said that I could have been his catcher. I was just joking around with him. He said something to indicate some interest in the fact that I played on a women's softball team and especially in that position. After he walked away, there were several times that various female employees came into the office to get something. I finally realized that the errand Kimberli W had run at lunch time was something that she had taken orders for something and she had gone to pick up the merchandise. The other employees who had purchased things from her were coming in to her office to pay her and pick up their things. One time someone came in and Kimberli W wasn't around but she saw her things sitting on the floor. She wanted to pay and take her things instead of waiting for Kimberli W or coming back. I asked her to wait while I tried to find Kimberli W's credit card. Then I realized it wasn't Kimberli W's credit card that I would need. I needed this woman's credit card. She handed it to me. I wrote down all of the information that I thought Kimberli W would need on something that I had seen others have as a receipt. She left with her merchandise and her receipt. I went after her and told her that I was sorry to bother her but she had left with all copies of the receipt instead of just the pink copy. There were actually two different types of receipts. I took the pink slip out of each one and gave them to her. She said something to me. "

As I got ready to leave he offered to make me some coffee. Even though I said no, he insisted. Then he had me put the first two fingers of my right hand in a box of powered chocolate. When I took them out he told me to put them in my mouth and lick them off. Obviously, this felt very provocative to me and it appeared to me that he had a romantic interest in me, or something other than professional. We played around, though I don't know how to explain it. It was nothing sexual at all. I had something of his and he was chasing me around the house trying to get it back and we were laughing. He caught me in a room with a bed, knocking me down on the bed. We kissed but we were interrupted by another man that he knew so we got up and went back out into the other room. Eventually he asked me on a date.

I decided that since it was so unusual for him to show up in one of my dreams that I should call him, so I did. We decided to meet. He was living in an apartment with Chip P. Chip P looked just as he did in high school, not appearing to have aged a bit. James K looked as though he had aged, but as with many men, looked even better than he did in high school. I was remembering how he looked in high school, as though I was looking at his senior photo. He no longer wore glasses. He still seemed very reserved and not very confident around women. Chip P was just as outgoing and confident as ever. We decided to leave the apartment and go somewhere for a cup of coffee. We developed an attraction to each other and decided to go on a date. I knew he was dating someone else and she knew about me. He had to choose between us. I had a sense that he was going to choose me, though I wasn't confident of that."

I was going to divide them into their theorist groups and have each group sit together each week. Some of the students changed them after I had put them where I wanted them.

When I saw what time it was I was just frantic. I was rushing around trying to figure out what to do and the quickest way to get ready and get there. I decided I should call Judy A and tell her what happened, though I didn't know what I was going to say to her. This was so major, so bad, for me to do this. I went to the computer to try to find her phone number but then quit and asked Matthew to find it for me.

There were no rails or anything to hold on to, but this was what everyone used for transportation. They simply stood on it while it traveled. The time period seems to be the Victorian Era. I was concerned about falling off so I reached up and put my hand on the shoulder of a man standing in front of me and said something to him about my concern. He reassured me that there was no reason for concern. He was wearing a dark green jacket and a top hat. We arrived at the center of a small town. I am walking around the town with this man and two other people, a man and a woman. The woman reminds me of a TV character named Miranda. The second man decided to go off by himself for a bit and then rejoin us. Miranda and I needed a restroom. The first man said there weren't any around. I suggested that surely one of the shops had a public restroom or one they would let an out-of-towner use. Miranda and I went into a women dress shop to inquire. The woman working there pointed to two doors, one for men and one for women. I went to the women's room and opened the door. The doorway was very narrow. I had to turn sideways to get in, and even then I really had to inhale and squeeze through. Inside, there was barely room to move. My arms nearly touched the walls on either side of me and there was little more room than that in front of me. There was no sink to wash your hands, just this tiny closet of a room. Miranda later went off by herself, leaving the first man and me to walk alone."
"1505"	"(2007-01-05)"	"Matthew was out for awhile so I decided to fix lunch. I was going to deep-fry something, which I would never do in waking life. As I was waiting for the oil to heat I saw a plate of mini egg rolls sitting on the counter and decided to reheat them by putting them in the oil as well. I had a very large soup pan and only had a few inches of oil in it. As the things I put in started cooking I was doing some other things in the kitchen and suddenly noticed oil spilling out of the pan onto the stove and the counter top. I just kept working and then noticed the oil getting very near the edge of the countertop. I quickly grabbed a few paper towels and placed them at the edge to prevent the oil from going on to the floor. Then I noticed that some had already dripped onto the floor. I took my paper towel and began trying to wipe up the oil wherever I saw it. I noticed that the burner drip tray was completely full of oil. I looked into the pan and saw that there was almost no oil left in it. I turned off the burner. Using a strainer spoon, I lifted the food out of the pan in a little at a time and placed it all on a plate that had a paper towel on it, so the some of the oil would soak into the paper towel. Sometime during this Matthew came home and had some leftovers with him from the meal he had while he was out. It was also something fried, but there were little bits of whatever it was. I put it in the oil with my things to reheat it as well. I had just finished taking the things off the stove when some of my family showed up. We all sat down in the living room. After a little while I realized that they were planning to stay for a little while but I knew I needed to eat so I brought the plate of things I had taken off the stove, popped one in my mouth and brought the rest to the living room to share. I sat the plate on an ottoman and told everyone to help themselves. BJ is the only person that took one. I continued to eat as we talked. I told Matthew that I had a new project I wanted him to help me with. I told him that I wanted to make the screened porch usable and especially, to put my chaise lounge that sits on the patio in the summer out there so I have a place that I can sit and read. It appeared that he didn't really see what I was going for, or didn't think it would work. I said that I realized I wouldn't be able to use the room when it is raining, but I could use it any other time. I also said I don't know why I haven't done anything with it before now. I've thought about it before and even talked about it before. In the dream I was trying to remember which of my waking life homes had this screened in porch. I thought about the house on Lakeland Dr., but immediately remembered that we had built a deck on the back of that house that ran 2/3rd of the length of the house. I then remembered, still in the dream, that I had dreamt about this same screened porch before, not that it had been on any of my homes. It is certainly something I would love to have on a home. The porch runs the full length of my home in the dream, which is a long ranch home. It isn't very wide. We all walk out there to talk about what I want to do with it. As soon as we enter the porch we see lots of things sitting here and there. There is a bicycle, a single chair facing a small cabinet housing a Nintendo video game. As I look at the various things I look at Matthew and ask if he remembered it was out there and if it was something he still wanted. Some of the things I was disappointed in myself that I had forgotten that they were there. Someone said they noticed three pair of boots sitting just inside the door that leads to the yard. They said that was a sign that this room was obviously used some times. I'm sitting on a small outdoor bench facing the other part of the house. Bill F. is sitting to my right. I mention some item that was back there and asked him if he wanted it and he shook his head no. I mentioned something else and asked if he wanted that and he shook his head no again. Then, I asked him if he wanted to play the video game and he shook his head yes as he stood up to walk over to it. Then BJ came up and was crouched down near the floor and showed me a sketch she did for what she thought I should do in the room. Her drawing showed various pieces of dark wood furniture and the primary color in the room was a deep red. As she was explaining her suggestions to me I was just thinking that it was nice and I agreed with her, but that would all take money and I'm still unemployed."
"1506"	"(2007-01-06)"	"Most of this nightmare felt like a chase scene from a movie. I was at my birth home spending the night. Bev was a child, maybe six or seven years old. I was in bed doing something on my laptop. I put the laptop away and tried to go to sleep. I couldn't get comfortable so I finally took my clothes off, thinking that no one ever comes in the room or even opens the door without my permission when I'm spending the night there. A few minutes later Bev came and crawled into bed. I decided I would quietly my clothes back on as soon as she fell asleep and in the meantime I would just make sure there were always blankets between us. Something seemed to be wrong but she wouldn't say much. Mother came in the room and gave her what must have been a favorite doll that was wrapped in two blankets. A little while later Mother came in the room with a small bouquet of flowers and gave those to Bev, laying them with her in bed. I thought this was very odd. After Mother left the room I coaxed Bev into talking to me. She wasn't feeling well physically. Mother had given her something and then brought the doll and the flowers in for comfort. I moved the blankets off of bed because of the flowers and realized that mother had wrapped Bev in two plastic bags. The one closest to her was the kind of plastic bag you use for fresh produce at a grocery store, but Bev fit in it completely. There was another plastic bag over the top of it. They were completely stuck to her body because they were making her so hot. I quickly took them off of her for fear of what they would do to her. I became furious with Mother for doing this and wondered why she would do such a thing, especially to Bev. I moved her close to me and just held her close to me and rubbed her back to comfort her. I think I was trying to comfort myself as much as her. I reached over to set my alarm so I wouldn't oversleep in the morning. As I did I hit the sleep button instead of the button to set the time on the alarm. This aggravated me because I didn't want to be listening to music for a half hour. I turned the volume way down and hoped I would remember to turn it back up in a half hour. Other members of the family showed up and came into the room. Mother and Daddy stayed in their bedroom the whole time. We began talking about some of the things they had done to all of us over the years. A few decided that it was time to confront them and then walk away. I asked Bev if she would want to come and live with me and she said yes. I didn't want to leave her there after that. Then Todd A came and sat next to her and she cuddled up to him. I asked her if she would rather live with me or be wherever Todd A was and she said with Todd A. I was surprised and hurt but did my best not to show it. Bob F had each of us write a note to Mother and Daddy on small note cards. I didn't want to do it. I was concerned about what this would do to Daddy, since he is the more fragile of the two, both emotionally and physically. I finally wrote something but I didn't even know how to begin to put into words what I felt, especially on this little card. I don't think what I wrote was even close to accurate. It was more of something just to appease my siblings. After everyone was done writing their notes Bob F took them to their bedroom, gave them to them, and then returned to my room. I told Bev she needed to pack a few things right away. We were all just going to leave. Bev kept getting distracted and I kept trying to get her focused on getting some things together so we could leave. We were all going to leave together so no one person was left alone to possibly face them. Before we could leave they walked into my bedroom. It's a small room so it seemed like wall-to-wall people. There was just barely room for them to step inside the door. I don't remember much of the conversation except that they tried to address a few of us individually about what we had written on the card. When they got to me, I mostly told them that they could never accept me for who I am and what I want to do with my life. They responded and as tears came to my eyes my voice cracked as I told them I've never been able to just be myself around them and we've never been able to talk to them. Mother walked out of the room for a couple of minutes and then returned with what appeared to be a six or so medicine tablets in her hand. She began to tell me how she had found these laying here and there when I was still living at home, before I got married. I looked at the small white, round pills and asked what they were. Daddy asked me what they looked like. I just looked up at him and then at Mother and knew immediately that they were birth control pills. Mother looked at me with the same disgust that had become familiar to me so many years ago. I got angry and asked her why she would save them, especially all of these years. Before she had a chance to answer I asked her if it made her angry because I didn't talk to her first like Bev did. I reminded her that she suggested that Bev move in with her fianc_e before she got married. At least I didn't do that. They both turned and walked out of the run and we all left. I kept Bev close to me because I knew this would be most upsetting to her. I thought she and I were going to get in BJ's car but then Brian F told me that BJ was riding with her and there was room for us in his car because it was some unusual kind of car with three rows of seats. As Bev and I got in the middle seat I saw the third row of seats behind us. Now we were trying to get away without someone catching us. We seemed to be on the high school property. There were quite a few buildings and there were cement steps what seemed to be about every hundred feet or so. They were very close together. Each time we came to a set of steps there were three flights. The first flight went one direction, the next flight went in the opposite direction, and the third flight in the same direction as the first. Brian F backed down the flights of steps in his car. He went so fast that I was frightened but he did it so cleanly that I realized he had done this more than once before. As is typical for him, he was laughing as he did it. Sometimes he took these hills that were as steep down and then immediately up again just like a roller coaster. Bev and I neither one liked it at all and I told him so. He said it was necessary. I didn't recognize or know a few of the people with us. They were friends of some of the family members. We had to stop for a little while for some reason. One of the females with us that I didn't know decided she was going to use the restroom while we were stopped. The restroom was not enclosed along the front. It was a long row of stalls with doors, but no walls. It was night time so you couldn't see much. If I strained my eyes I could see her feet under the stall door. It was a coed restroom. She took so long we kept asking her if she was okay or if she was about ready to go. She finally came out and now we had to wait for someone else. I decided to use the restroom very quickly before we left again. Six or eight other family members followed me. Now there were no walls to the stalls. It was just three long rows of toilets out in the open. I was very embarrassed and didn't like this when the other family members came in but none of them seemed to mind. An employee was standing there waiting for us to leave so she could close up for the night. I quickly got up and walked away. After everyone else was back in the cars I went back to the restroom hoping to use it in private but the woman had replaced all of the toilets with tan plastic chairs. We were no longer in cars. We were in something that reminds me of the cars of a roller coaster at an amusement park, except that each car could only seat one person and the person in front actually drove it. There were several of these though, with several members of the family in each. The first couple of times that we got out and back in I put Bev in the seat with me even though the seat was only made to hold one person. I had her wear the seatbelt. The last two times we got out and back in Bev wanted to sit alone in the very back seat. I said okay, but frequently turned around to check on her. We were now traveling on rails that looked somewhat like roller coaster tracks, except the look of what was on the bottom of them changed frequently. There were three or four different looks in all. The track was barely wider than the width of an adult. Some times we traveled on them much faster than others. People who worked on this property knew we were there and were chasing us. Peggy F and some of Bob F's boys were with us. Mari Kate S was with us and was car sick. She was sitting right behind me. Nothing I suggested to her helped her. Now the car that I was in was being driven by someone I didn't know. He stopped the car long enough to put a plastic tub next to her in case she became too ill. We got split up. They started pointing guns at us. Brian F pulled out a gun, shot, and killed one of the men. I was horrified and even more concerned about what this was all doing to Bev. The others let us think we were all getting away and then I suddenly saw a series of explosions on a track a little distance from us. I could only watch as I realized that members of my family were being killed one-by-one. I was too upset to even scream or cry. I was trying to think who might have been in that car. I got out and began running with Bev. I thought we were getting away. As we kept running, down steps, sliding down some cement tracks, etc., other family members would see us and join us. We got to a place that looked like a bit of a maze and we saw a guard with a flashlight approaching. We all crouched down as far as we could hoping not to be detected. I was covering Bev. The guard was practically right next to us, shining the flashlight around looking at various things. Sometimes the beam of her flashlight just barely missed us. Bev was now an adult and was sitting further behind me. She had on a dangling bracelet that kept making noise. I heard others behind me giggling. I was getting very upset. The guard was going to hear this. She did and shined her flashlight on us. All of the women in our group offered to give her all of our jewelry if she would just let us go. She agreed. We got to a grassy hill. All we had to do was climb the hill, get through a wire fence and cross the road on the other side of the fence. Then we could disappear into the wooded area there. Actually, I was thinking that once we were off of their property they couldn't do anything, but I didn't want to take any chances. I wanted to get into the woods so they couldn't spot us. Bev was small again now. I raced across the road with her and some other family members followed me. Someone thought we should stay visible to try to get the attention of any of the others if we saw them. I thought one person could be the lookout for the others without being seen, only to stand out and get their attention if they saw them. It would minimize the risk. At the end I wondered if everyone was actually okay, that maybe someone else had been killed in the explosions. [I didn't record all of this because I don't want to.]"

"1509"	"(2007-01-09)"	"Matthew as a child, probably 9-years-old or less. Living in a very bad neighborhood. I wasn't his mom. A tall, large, black woman was his mom. I don't know if his mom didn't realize how dangerous the neighborhood was or if she just didn't think much about it. She would let him walk places alone, even after dark. There were two opposing gangs in the area. The first time he went out one of the gangs went after him but an older man stopped them. He was working with the other gang to get them to change their ways and use their strengths and abilities to contribute to the community. After that first time, whenever Matthew went out this other gang always looked out for him and protected him. There was an old, run-down, cracker box of a house, except it was only one square room. All four walls were mostly windows and the only furniture was a few worn wooden benches with no backs. This was a hang-out spot for the good gang. One time I was in there with Matthew. It was very dark in there and there were signs of some kind hanging in every window, blocking the view. Some members of the bad gang were outside trying to look in. As I got down to lay on the floor under one of the benches I told Matthew to do the same and to stay very quiet until they went away. Some members of the good gang showed up and got rid of the other men. When they came in they said something to Matthew and I. Something happened with the old man. I don't know if he died or if he had move away and not be with the gang. Maybe he was losing the house. I just have this sense of loss. Matthew went home to his mom. They lived in a very strange looking apartment building. When he entered the front door there was a long hallway in front of him. The floor was dirty, white tiles and the walls were white also, but not clean at all. The people who lived there were very cautious with their locks and such because it was such a bad area. Someone got upset because he had made too much noise. He went into his apartment where his mom was. As soon as he got home she bolted and chained the door. I have this sense of a very large, almost poster size, color photograph of her sitting on an easel, and again a sense of loss. I think she died."
"1510"	"(2007-01-09)"	"Attending the Ellen DeGeneres TV program. She was having a contest related to painting t-shirts. I didn't want to paint on any of my t-shirts and didn't want to tell her that. But I wanted to participate in the contest. I decided to paint on my black SAID t-shirt with black paint. You could only see it if you were really looking for it, or at certain angles. You could feel it. I thought that would be unique and get her attention anyway. I used a can of spray paint, while wearing the shirt, and painted the name Ellen in large block letters on the front. I realized I would have to take it off and put it on backwards so I could paint her last name on the back of the shirt. I was sitting in the audience. The back rows had very few people sitting in them, but I was one of them. I was there alone. When it was time to leave I saw the cap to the spray paint and to my water bottle lying next to me but I couldn't find the spray paint or the water bottle. "
"1511"	"(2007-01-10)"	"I was organizing things, and putting them in order. I was working in the office of a retail business. An employee was stealing clothing from the company for her baby or toddler, partially because there were things that she needed and couldn't afford but some of things she stole were simply things that she wanted. One part of the office reminds me of the backroom of NTNS except it was much longer and the ceiling was much higher. We have lost something and there are several of us looking for it. We're looking in an area that looks like the backroom. It seems to be about the same size and shape of a flipchart but I know that's not what it is. It does have something to do with information though. Susan J is working in the backroom of NTNS. She is very cheery. There have been some changes and she is telling me how much more comfortable she is working there now. There are two male employees and one male member of the top management team get into an elevator. I reached out and stopped the doors from closing so I could get in as well. We thought we had stopped this employee from stealing. I'm sitting in a car in a parking lot and see her with a male in vehicle. I realize that she has still been stealing from us and her mom has been helping her without being aware that she is helping her to steal. It's as though I'm watching a TV commercial with a bunch of young people in their late teens or early twenties. The camera focuses in on just one of them. They are humming a tune while going. The camera changes focus to another one who is humming the same tune. They do this maybe ten or twelve times with a number of different people. The background or environment is different each time. There is a marching band in uniform giving a performance. The song that they are playing is the same one that all of the young people were humming."
"1512"	"(2007-01-11)"	"I'm standing with a group of people looking at a large parcel of land. We are going to be building a home for Uncle J and Aunt A. Then someone rips off a corner of something, still related to the house and it reveals another layer of something. It is significant that they are doing this. It signifies something. We build the house with all of the latest technological advances. Their bed is particularly unusual. It is motorized and comes apart into sections that turn it into a square sitting area. It does something else as well but I can't recall now what it was. I thought they would especially like that part. Their whirlpool tub was also unique in what it does. I knew they would also be very excited about that. We all had to stop working on the house to attend a wedding. While I was at the wedding Marlene F came up to me. She had two, very pretty, dark-silver chain necklaces fashioned in a twisted rope look that she laid down in front of me. I was sitting and looked up at her and said, you need the necklaces that I was responsible for buying and I would go home to get them. We had a prior discussion some weeks ago about me being able to do something to help. She thought this was the list I could do, to buy these necklaces. They wanted one for each female guest at the wedding. I agreed to take care of this because I thought I could take care of it without my crazy schedule and over-commitment getting in the way. When she came up to me I didn't want to tell her that I didn't do it, especially that I had forgotten. So I gave her the impression that I simply forgot to bring them with me. As I was leaving I realized that even if I was able to find them right now she was still going to have to wrap each of them and she needed seven hundred of them. That was going to take a long time to wrap. As I walked out of the building there was a long line of people waiting to get in. It must have been the reception line, that people were congratulating the newlyweds as they entered the building. I saw some of the Kunkel's, my cousins, standing in line. I asked if any of them had been to the house yet to see the progress we had made but none of them had. I was driving alone in a very unusual little car. It kind of reminds me of a bumper car at an amusement park except that it is taller. There is room for only one person. There was nothing where my legs went. There were no pedals, no steering wheel or anything. I don't know where they would have room for those things, or even for an engine. I'm driving and I wanted to turn around and thinking that I knew there was a place shortly in front of me that I could turn around. When I got there I saw a chain link gate across the drive so I couldn't pull in there to turn around. It was a retail business area. These gates continued at every drive along there. I remembered street or road a few hundred feet in front of me that I take often that would be just as easy for me to take rather than just turning around on the same road I was on. I realized that the city had been doing major road construction and had completely gotten rid of this street or road. I had to keep going and was wondering how long I would have to drive to find a place to turn around. There were no more businesses, only a fence between the roadway and some grassy land, or fields, with trees in the distance on both sides of the road. I realized that I could just take 96th Street so I turned right as soon as I came to it. I took that to A1 Rd and prepared to turn right again. I was back in a retail business district again. I was concerned about the safety of turning right on red because the intersection was angled in a way that made it very difficult for me to see if anything was coming from my left to be sure that it was clear for me to turn right. I was thinking about talking to someone about this change. As I was driving down A1 Rd I pulled off along the side of the road. Uncle J and Aunt A walked up. Uncle J is standing in the grass to my right, but has crouched down to talk to me about this car that I'm driving. He is saying that it isn't legal to drive it on these roads. I told him that I'm aware of this but that it is so convenient for someone like me and how I wish someone would make a car like this that I could legally drive all the time. Aunt A is standing on the other side of my car reading a newspaper. She tells me about an ad in the paper for a place that is having a sale on chain necklaces. They are very nice quality but they are only ninety-nine cents each. The sale was going to end at 1:00 p.m. I looked at my watch and it was 1:01. I asked them if they had been to the house yet and they said they hadn't. I was so excited about what we were doing that I really wanted to be there when they saw it, especially the master suite with the special bed and whirlpool tub. I told them I was very sure that they were really going to love it. I decided to call the store and tell them my predicament and see if they would give me the sale price anyway because I needed seven hundred or all they had. It was now ten or fifteen minutes after the hour. I went to different stores but had trouble finding simple, silver chain necklaces and certainly couldn't find anyone that had seven hundred of them.

"1515"	"(2006-01-13)"	"Many of my family members were at my home for a gathering. It didn't look like my waking life home, inside or out. I had a basement in this home and outside you had to walk up eight or so steps to get to the front door. I had a Ficus Tree sitting near a door between a hallway and the living room. We had set up some folding chairs to have enough room for people to sit and one of them was sitting across from but very close to this tree, narrowing the walking space from the hallway into the living room. As people went through there they were constantly brushing against the tree and knocking leaves off. At first I was trying to keep them thinking that it was a silk tree and I could just put them back on later. By the end of the afternoon there were only a few branches left that still had leaves on them. Someone started talking about this and I said I was just going to reattach as many of the leaves that I still had so it wasn't a problem. But as I looked at it more I realized that it wasn't silk at all, that it was a live tree. I felt foolish for not knowing this. I realized this because I saw that it was live because the leaves were starting to brown and die from the abuse it had taken all day. I picked it up because it was very light, just like a silk one would be, and turned it a bit sideways and talked to someone about the fact that it was dying. I knew I needed to just dispose of it at this point. Someone offered to take it out to the dumpster for me. I said something to someone about how much larger the room felt without the tree in there. I was trying to be nice but inside I was very sad that my tree had been killed because I had it for so many years prior and I hate it when any of my houseplants die. Without telling me, when they did that they actually decided to chop up the branches and trunk and bring them back in so I could use them for firewood. There much more firewood from it than I would have imagined, with longer and thicker pieces than I thought it had. But it was clean and easy for me to move and manage so I appreciated it. When you came in the front door, you would take a few steps to your left and then there was a wall to your left running vertically in the direction you were facing. It was a short wall and that is where the fireplace was. When facing the fireplace, at the left end of the fireplace was another wall that created a corner, but that wall was a small curve away from the fireplace. I had them set the wood on the floor in front of the fireplace and on the hearth. Matthew asked me if I had ever used that fireplace since we had been living there and I told him I didn't think we had but I love fireplaces and would certainly love to. I was trying to remember why I had never used it. I used the fireplaces in my previous homes quite frequently. We all went downstairs but I don't remember why. I was talking about the fact that I would like to rearrange the furniture and things down there to create several different areas or zones. I wanted a small sitting area where people could just sit and talk or read, an area to watch TV, and an area for games as I had one or two game tables, though I can't remember what kind they were. Bev and Matthew thought it would be fun to help me move things around and see what we could come up with so the other adults decided to help. I immediately thought of three chairs down there that I thought would be best for the sitting area. People brought other chairs over for that area and I was trying to kindly tell them that I didn't think they were the best there. I didn't want to nix everything they tried or be critical when they were willing to help me. We finally agreed on three chairs and a small round table. The table sat against the wall with two chairs flanking it and one facing it and all placed fairly close together so it was a very cozy area where people could talk quietly and still be able to hear each other very well. That part was easy but the rest we kept moving things around and around trying to find something that worked. I seemed to have more than one sofa. There is a somewhat short hallway leading away from the main area of the basement that leads to doctor's offices. I asked what they thought about storing the children's toys along the wall in the hallway across from the office doors. I thought the hallway was wide enough that they wouldn't be in the way and the children could get the toys and bring them into the main area to play rather than playing in the hallway. Still, no one thought that was a good idea. I had walked away for a little bit and when I came back they had placed two sofas in the hall along the same wall as the office doors. It didn't leave very much room to walk through there and I said that there had to be enough room for patients to walk through there to get to the doctors offices. Behind the sofas looks like a huge storage area with all kinds of boxes and stuff sitting there, almost forming a wall behind the sofas. Where the main area met the hallway there was another set of steps leading up to a room or two that were not part of the house where we came down from. Doctor C was up there sleeping. While we were moving things around he came down as he was getting ready to leave for work, to see patients. He was very tired and somewhat grumpy, which wasn't all that unusual. I talked to him briefly as he was fixing his tie. He had on black slacks with a grey tweed suit jacket, white shirt, and black tie. He looked very handsome. I think that particular combination makes most men look good. As he got ready to head up the other set of steps to leave I put my hand on his upper back and told him to have a good day. Outside near the dumpster I saw two large round flowerpots, probably twenty inches in diameter. One had a large, white Hydrangea in it that didn't have many blooms left on it, which is why someone had set it by the dumpster. The other had some kind of deep rose colored flower in it that was wilted and falling over the edge of the pot. I asked some of the male family members if they would get them and bring them into my home. I wanted to see if I could save them because I thought they were both such pretty flowers and I didn't have any hydrangeas or the other. They thought I was kind of crazy but they did as I asked. Doctor C came back from work and everyone is still in the basement, sitting around tables and other places eating a casual dinner of sub sandwiches that we had made. Doctor C picked up a full length sub, took a couple of bites of it, set it down on a chair and walked away. Seconds later he went back and picked it up. I was standing on a landing half way up the steps that led up to the other room or two. I was leaning against the wall just watching everyone and smiling. Doctor C came up to where I was standing. I turned slightly and leaned my back against the wall. He stood very close to me, facing me. He held his sandwich with one hand and with his right hand turned me slightly so he could put his right arm around my back and pull me closer. We didn't say much, if anything, just stood there slightly smiling at each other. A couple of times, in between bites, he leaned a bit closer and gave me a very quick, light kiss on the lips."
"1516"	"(2007-01-14)"	"Bob F and I were babysitting Bev's children at her house. She only had two and they were both much younger than in waking life, and much closer in age. We took them somewhere in an SUV. It had gotten very quiet in the car so I asked where everyone was. Neither of the children answered. I turned around and didn't see either of them in the two seats behind us. It was dark so I reached back with my hand to see if I could feel them on the floor but they weren't there. I became panicked. Bob F turned the vehicle around and started slowly retracing our route while we watched outside to see if we could find them, thinking that they had maybe somehow gotten out of the vehicle. We were on a street in a subdivision and there were children everywhere trick or treating. We finally stopped the car, got out and opened the back of the SUV. There they were they were crouched down behind the back seat hiding from us. They thought it was funny until they realized how angry we were. I told them to never, ever do anything like that again. We took the Bob F was going to drive me home when they got back and then drive all the way back to his house, which would mean five or six hours driving time for him. Bev called about eight in the evening to say they were on their way home and asked if we wanted them to stop and get anything on their way. We said no, we were fine. She was concerned about Bob F staying awake doing all that driving, especially so late at night. I told her that he and I agreed we would stop along the way to get something if he started getting drowsy. When they arrived home Bev tried to get Rachel S to bed while we got ready to go but she said she only wanted me to put her to bed. I went back into the house and helped her get ready for bed. I got a peach-colored, lightweight nightgown that was very girly and pretty and had a matching robe. In the bathroom I got the nightgown on her, helped her put the robe on, and then walked her into her bedroom. She lay down on the floor under a hardback chair and immediately closed her eyes and fell asleep. I went back outside and told Bev she fell asleep almost immediately after she lay down. I commented that she does the same thing Bev used to do, sleeping on the floor all the time."
"1517"	"(2007-01-14)"	"I had gone out to run errands. I walked by one store that should have been open and saw a sign in the window that it was closed for bass fishing. My first thought was that it was kind of odd but then thought it was also kind of cool that someone would do that today. I went in to Sullivan's for something. I walked by a display of small boats for fishing. One in particular, was only large enough for one individual and was made particularly for bass fishing. I could tell there had been several there and that there was only one left. The one that was left was one I had taken in to sell on consignment. It was in perfect condition when I took it there but now it was coming apart at the seams. I picked it up, intending to take it home and fix it. Halfway to the door I decided I shouldn't do that so I went and placed it back where it had been. I went to an older male employee and said something to him. He acted very nonchalant but followed me to the display. Then I noticed that there was a large piece of it missing also. I was upset that it was in perfect condition when I brought it in. He took it and said he was going to go look at it and see what it would take to repair it. He came back with it and told me it was going to cost me more than one hundred dollars to have it repaired. I was furious. They shouldn't be charging me to repair this when they were responsible for it being damaged. I told him I was just going to take it back home and I picked it up and left. I left through a different door that I came in. There were lots of employees working just outside the door, some on various types of large equipment. One woman sitting and working on top of a large piece of machinery stopped me and asked me if I wanted a job. I inquired as to why she would stop me and ask me that as I didn't know her at all and had never even seen her before. She said I just looked like someone who could do the job well. I asked her what the work was. She asked me to wait just a second. Then she told me to take her place and she would show me how easy it was. It required me to line two one quarter inch pieces of paper on top of each other and then on top of a specific part of a full sheet of paper and feeding them into this machine lined up just perfectly and then entering some codes. I couldn't get the paper lined up. The woman's supervisor walked up and stood on the other side of the machine trying to help me. I said I couldn't keep doing this right now. She looked at me quizzically. I said that I left the house this morning at six thirty, intending to run a five-minute errand so I didn't dress for being out and about. I had on a very short pajama dress that barely covered by bottom and I was concerned each time that I leaned forward that if anyone was standing behind me they would see part of my bottom. I kept reaching behind me and trying to tug it down and sit on it but it was making me very nervous and uncomfortable. Finally, she said I would do fine and asked me when I could start. She said I could work as much or as little as I wanted and could come in whenever I wanted without notice. I was still confused as to why they would want to hire me when they knew nothing about me. The supervisor said I was obviously way over qualified for this job but they would be glad to have me. She asked me something, and with a shy smile I said that I do have a Ph.D. She just smiled and nodded her head up and down. I told her I would give it a try and probably come in some the next day, which was Friday. They thanked me and said they would look forward to seeing me. I walked away and got lost on the property. They had so many different work areas that were partially enclosed with three walls and a ceiling but never a fourth wall. I kept ending up in places that I knew was for employees only. The first time I felt very nervous about this but then realized that I am an employee now so it won't be quite so bad that I'm there. Each area looked very different, with different kinds of equipment and different structural elements inside each. Some had conveyor belts that moved upward at an angle and led into a small square in the wall. Some had steps. Most of them had places every few feet that barriers would lower from the ceiling to prevent people who were walking or on other equipment from proceeding if a large piece of equipment was coming through. It was intended to prevent any types of accidents or injuries. These barriers didn't look the same in each area. Sometimes the area was broken into sections in that I would walk a few feet and another barrier would come down. As soon as it was safe it would raise and I could proceed a little further and then another barrier would come down. Sometimes there would someone standing on something higher than floor level who would shout out to let people know a barrier was about to drop. I kept reaching behind me and tugging at the back of my pajama gown. One time I felt a hole in it so I began walking with one hand behind me covering the hole. I was getting tired from so much walking because the facility was so large and I just kept getting lost and I was carrying this boat with me. Finally, a man came up to me on something that reminds me of a small flat bed trailer with a painted steel pipe on one end in an upside down u-shape. Attached to the top of the pipe was something that was used to propel it forward and to steer it. It was a flat piece shaped like shield with a round handle protruding from the small end and pointing towards the person who would be steering. The person driving it would stand on it at this point and use that handle to move it side to side for steering and pump it up and down to propel it forward. I told him I was a new employee and didn't know my way around and that I kept getting lost and was getting very tired. This man directed me back to where I needed to be and told me I could use this to get me there. When I first got on I could get it to move forward. He showed me I had to use a little more pressure and then I got it to go. I had to keep stopping for the barriers and I still kept getting lost. I was getting so frustrated and agitated and upset. I felt like crying. I was wishing someone would just take me to where I needed to be. I kept finding myself back at places that I had already been. Once I thought I was at the right place so I got off the flat bed and began walking to the entry and then realized it wasn't. Someone else came up to me and offered me a kind of scooter to use. Both the flatbed and the scooter were a bright, industrial yellow. I tried again and continued to get lost. A few times when I stopped an employee would talk to me briefly. I finally got back to the entry that I needed and was so relieved. There were other things that I needed to get to my car. An employee and the owner were standing there and offered to help me carry the things to my car. The employee started off to the left and the manager told her to come the other way. There was a narrow enclosed staircase to the right that he said would be much closer and quicker. The employee started up first and then the manager nodded his head for me to go next. I told him I would rather follow him, though I didn't want to tell him that it was because of my short pajama gown. He went ahead of me. When we neared the top of the steps the employee said something about how much closer and quicker it was and the manager said didn't I tell you?"
"1518"	"(2007-01-14)"	"I was using the bathroom at ITI. I went to wash my hands and couldn't find the soap dispenser. I was wondering what they did with it. Then the towel dispenser wasn't where it used to be. I found where they had moved it. Another woman was in there and partially blocking the towel dispenser. I reached for a towel but what I pulled out felt more like a wad of hair strands, which made me very uncomfortable. I just threw them in the trash receptacle. It felt like the other woman was watching me. I stepped back to the counter to check my hair and realized I had left my headband in before I left home and was actually wearing two of them. I had one black fabric one, the type that is a circle that you slip around your neck and then pull up over your hair. On top of that I had a red plastic one that you simply slide onto the top of your head where you want it to hold your hair back. My hair was white blonde, very straight. The length was just above chin. I took the red headband off and placed it in my bag. There was a partial wall partition between this counter and another. I stepped to the other side of the wall partition, away from the other woman to finish fixing my hair. I liked the way it looked that day. As I got ready to leave the bathroom I couldn't remember where I had been working that morning. Then I realized that I hadn't been working there at all that morning. They hadn't called me yet to come back in. I had been operating in a trance all morning and had gotten up, got dressed, and came here without even realizing it. I was so embarrassed and I didn't want anyone to know. Fortunately, I could leave the bathroom and get to the door without anyone but the receptionist seeing me. She wouldn't know any different so I just left. I was very upset as I got in my car and left. I got to the circle in the road and it was only one lane instead of the two that it has in waking life. There was a row of people standing in the lane. They were all facing one man at the front of the line, who was facing them and talking. They were having some kind of a meeting. Even though I was in my car, it felt like I was just standing behind the last person in the line. I was contemplating what to do. I wouldn't go the wrong way on the circle and risk being hit head-on by another car, but there really wasn't a way for me to do that anyway from where I was. There was no other place for me to go. I decided to wait and see if they were getting ready to move but the front man just kept talking. I finally moved over to get his attention. He seemed irritated but finally directed the people to move off of the circle so car traffic could continue to use it. As I headed south on Meridian I was still very upset about operating in a trance earlier. I was thinking about all the things I might have done without even realizing it. What if anyone else had seen me? Had I spoken with anyone? It was very upsetting. When I approached the ramp to the highway I realized that the city had been doing some major construction and was turning this into one of those highway rest areas that you see on overpasses in Chicago. Between thinking about that and still being upset about what happened earlier I missed my ramp and didn't realize it until I had gone another two or more miles. I was got very upset with myself now for my lack of focus on my driving and where I was going. I tried to decide the best way for me to go now to get back home. It was raining and there was lots of traffic, which was making me feel even more agitated. I decided I would go to Westfield Blvd and take that home but then passed it without realizing it. I was trying to figure out what to do next and found myself downtown. I'm driving through this one lane street that feels more like a walking path. I remember someone else driving me through here so I know that it really is intended for cars. It weaves around a number of historical buildings that are very old and beautiful in their architectural detail. I finally decided to just park and take a walk. I was thinking about how nice it would be to be able to shop at some different stores to find clothing a little higher quality and with a little more style than what I normally buy. I decide to just walk through some of the stores and see what types of things are available and at what price. I stopped to look at something displayed in a window. Two men cross behind me and enter a dry cleaner. Within minutes they come out and go on their way. As they are walking away from me I recognize the one man as someone I had met with for an informational interview. I was glad that he hadn't seen me. The other man I recognized but I couldn't remember where I had met or seen him before. I continued to walk and find myself walking through a building close to the Humanities Council office. I remembered having lunch there with the president of the Humanities Council. It was the start of lunch hour and the place was beginning to get busy with working people on their lunch break. I had walked through the building to get to the other side of the block instead of walking all the way around in the rain. As I stepped outside again I opened my umbrella and began to stroll down the street. I wasn't in a hurry and wasn't sure where I even wanted to go. I wasn't familiar with the stores downtown, what stores were there or where they were or anything. I stopped momentarily on a corner. There was an older couple standing there under a navy blue umbrella. The edges of the umbrella were made very different than anything I had ever seen before in that the ends folded in creating little pockets on the underside edges of the umbrella. I realized that this kept the water from dripping on you so much and thought that was a very nice feature for an umbrella. She said something to me about enjoying the rain and I agreed with her and commented that not too many people feel that way about rain. She smiled. The three of us began chatting. While we were chatting the state governor walked up to us with another man. The governor knew this couple I was talking with and stopped to say hello to them. He looked at me so I extended my hand and introduced myself. He half-smiled, shook my hand and then continued talking with the couple. Now other people had gathered and joined the conversation and I found myself on the outside of the gathering with no one even seeing me there. I tried briefly to get the attention of the woman I had been talking to so I could mind my manners and tell her it was nice chatting with her but I couldn't so I just walked away. As I walked I came upon another older woman. She said something to me about shopping. I asked her if she would mind telling me where she shops for her clothes as I really liked her style. She thanked me and told the names of two stores that she shops at mostly. I had not heard of either so I asked her where they were and she pointed them out to me. I walked into the first one and felt very disoriented. I couldn't tell if I was in a mall or in a single store. There seemed to be construction going on. I saw some women clothing through an opening so I went in there. There weren't a lot of things and there were too many women shopping around my size for me to be able to look at anything. I heard a group of friends talking. One of them looked and sounded so much like Dorothea D that I looked closely several times to be sure it wasn't her. I went to another area with women clothing. The third area I went in to I finally decided to at least try something on, so I selected two items. A sales clerk saw me and headed towards me. She wasn't sure which dressing room to send me to but finally decided on one and pointed it out to me. Just as I got to the entrance a man came out. This made me wonder if I was in the right place but there was nothing else around so I decided it had to me. Maybe this was just a main entrance and behind the door I would find separate entrances for men and for women. That wasn't the case but I realized it was only women in there. The whole thing was made out of heavy cardboard. There was a swinging door at the main entrance that didn't fit right and was hard to push open. Each of the single dressing booths were barely deep enough for a person to stand inside. I couldn't stand inside and change clothes so I left the door partially open. I tried to change in a way that I wouldn't feel too exposed. The first thing I tried on was a pair of black dress pants that was part of a suit. They were way too tight on the thighs and I couldn't even get them all the way on my thighs. I was very discouraged but realized that sized fit differently at different stores. I know this from experience so now I at least have a better idea of what size I will need to buy if I shop at this store. I decided not to even try the other thing on."
"1519"	"(2007-01-15)"	"I was at my birth home in my old bedroom except that it wasn't a home anymore. The current owners had turned it into a business office. I was surrounded by piles of paper and working with at least two other people in that room."
"1520"	"(2007-01-15)"	"Matthew was supposed to come home and go with me to see a movie or play. I can't figure out from the images which it is. He find out he wasn't going to be able to come. Before he told me he tracked down one of my friends from high school and invited her and her son to come and go with me and he would provide the tickets. Just minutes after he told that he wasn't going to be able to come, Dorothea D and Alex D showed up. Alex D was still a boy, maybe twelve years old. I was very happy to see her. She told me what Matthew did. The movie or play we were going to see was something like The Christmas Carol. Rumor had it that the way it was presented made it somewhat scary to the audience. If it was a play it was because of the way the scary characters moved through the audience. If it was a movie it was because they had a technique to project the scary characters to look as though they were floating through the audience. There is an image of a character that appears to be covered in a very large white sheet and has very large black oval holes for eyes. It didn't look like there was a person in it at all but it did give the appearance of being alive.I looked into the area where the audience sits and saw there was another show in progress but very few people in the audience. One row of seats was full and there were just a few people sitting here and there throughout the rest of the theater."
"1521"	"(2007-01-16)"	"I was either writing a paper or grading a paper and inserting a couple of descriptive words that would show what it would take to earn each letter grade. Also a few descriptive words about that particular paper for each letter grade. At first I tried to create a table using Excel, where the first column was the letter grade, the second column was the descriptive words for the letter grade and the third column the descriptive words for that particular paper. When I inserted it into the document it wasn't very clear. It looked very fuzzy. I didn't like it at all. Then I tried doing it all vertically, instead of in a row. I didn't like the way that looked either and it seemed very confusing. It felt like I worked on this a long time."
"1522"	"(2007-01-17)"	"I was driving on a country road with someone. There was nothing but flat, empty fields for mile after mile. We finally came to a small building. It was dark outside. We went in. I was with Macy F. This is where we were staying for this year's conference. Other people began arriving. This one building is where everyone was going to be staying and it wasn't very large. It had three sleeping rooms that were connected. You had to walk through the first room to get to the second and through the first and second to get to the third. Each room had four sets of bunk beds. Two sets on each side of the room. This is where everyone attending the conference was staying. The men were staying in the third room. There were only 24 people attending the conference. I was talking to someone about the exhibit area. It must have been cold outside because they had to wipe off the window, like they were wiping off frost, so we could see outside. They pointed as they talked. There was a row of four or five small, brown, wood buildings. They were all just one-story. The smallest one on the end to my right was Amici's. The person I was talking to said this was the entire campus, along with the building we were in. I was dumbfounded. I couldn't believe any of this. I couldn't believe Bart H agreed to this location when we could have so few people there. How were we ever going to recoup our expenses? There were so many things going through my mind. Macy F said something to the effect of Bart H was going to get all of his expenses paid so nothing else mattered. Other people began arriving. Most of them were people who had attended previous conferences. Most of them were as dumbfounded as I was about the facilities. There was a group of people sitting and talking. Kendall B was one of them. I was one of them. I was thinking that with this being such a small conference perhaps Kendall B wouldn't be quite so busy this time and have time to have a conversation with him. I asked and he said absolutely, that it would fine. Later I realized that it wouldn't happen. I wasn't surprised but I was a bit disappointed. When it was finally time for me to sit and talk with Kendall B I was incredibly uneasy, uncomfortable, anxious. I was thinking about this as I sat there waiting for him. Feeling this way didn't really surprise as I've never sat down and had a face-to-face conversation with him. I've spoken briefly to him face-to-face, but never to sit down and have a real conversation or discussion and I've only had one telephone conversation with him. Nearly all of our communication has been via email which doesn't evoke the same feelings of anxiety or uneasiness etc. It also occurred to me how much I have always cared and continue to care, about his opinion of me and I'm concerned that a face-to-face meeting might offer more opportunity for me to do or say something I regret that would have a negative impact on his opinion of me. I don't think Macy F was planning on attending many if any of the conference activities. On the last day of conference we're talking about our trips home the next day. We want to be able to stay on the beach until the last possible minute and then hurry back to our rooms, pack our final few things and then head to the airport without showering first. We wondered if the airline would be okay with this. The next morning we do all of our packing except a few last minute items and then head to the beach until the last possible minute. We hurry back to our rooms, hurriedly get our last few things in our bags and then head to the airport. We stopped for gas. I was standing there talking to a group of people. I flicked my fingers at them the way you would after you wash your hands to get rid of some of the excess water. When I did that it allows each of them to know something that they didn't know before or do something that they couldn't do before."
"1523"	"(2007-01-18)"	"I was at ECHS. I noticed something outside of the school, something about the lot. They were doing some kind of work or changing something. It almost feels as though I was breaking into the school. Horses. Learning to lasso but not while sitting on or riding a horse. There was a man teaching me and another man. I learned how to do this much quicker than the man. Once we learned how to do this we would receive some privilege. It would allow us to do something that we currently aren't allowed to do and/or give us access to some area that we currently didn't have access to. Ken W, one of the teachers. I am in a classroom that isn't mine. I hear someone approaching so I quickly close and lock the door. The person comes to the door and puts their key in the lock but when they push on the door it won't open because I'm leaning against it as hard as possible to try to keep him from being able to open it. He jiggles the key and turns the door knob. Sometimes he pushes hard enough that he is able to get it open just an inch or two but I am fortunately able to get closed immediately again. He can't see me standing there but I don't know why because there is paned glass in the door. It must be frosted glass because I can see his form but cannot see him clearly. In a retail store. They have completely rearranged a clothing store that is for both genders and all ages. The children's clothing is now placed somewhere different. It's not that big of a store. I decide to change my clothes and go out to the horses and do something with them and practice lassoing. I went to my closet and was looking through things trying to decide what I wanted to wear. I was looking for something denim, a denim shirt or denim vest. As I'm walking out I don't want to be seen because I don't want people to see me skipping out but then I realize that this is going to help me with work so I have no reason to feel guilty about going out there right now. As I'm walking someone else is walking towards me and says something to me about the horses or about doing something for or with the horses. I either said that I already did it or that I'm on my way to do it now."

I opened the document to make the change and realized that the piece of information that I thought I needed to change was in a pdf, which meant it would already be correct and I wouldn't need to change it. I opened the pdf anyway to make sure and then I got confused. Then another thought occurred to me, making me think I did need to edit it anyway. Then another thought, which made me think it was okay. I went round and round like this for quite some time. I was becoming agitated, mostly because of my uncertainty about the right thing to do."

"1527"	"(2007-01-22)"	"I had remarried Darren and we were living in my townhouse. BJ and Kim H were there. Kim H started repainting living room. She had misunderstood something I said earlier about painting and started painting the wrong thing. Darren was being very mean to me. I heard BJ tell Kim H that she had never heard him talk to me that way before. I was kind of glad she had. Someone in the family finally saw how he treated me. We all started painting. I noticed on the wall behind the sofa that I had made a large rectangle out of the lighter shade of green but that it had dark green vertical streaks in it. It just looked like a messed up paint job. I didn't remember having done that or even remember it being that way. Some people weren't being very careful with the drop cloths and I was worried they were going to get paint on the floor or on the baseboard. It was getting very late and we were all very tired. Mike M called and said he would come over and help finish up if I wanted. When he first called I didn't recognize his voice so I had to ask who it was. I was so surprised and happy to hear from him. I asked him if he meant the offer and he said yes. I could tell by the tone of his voice he didn't really want to but that he wanted to be available if I really did want or need his help. I told him I really appreciated the offer but that it wasn't necessary."
"1528"	"(2007-01-23)"	"I was in a very unusual two-story home. One end of the home is attached to the owner's retail store. The home was owned by a couple with two young adult children. The woman had asked me to talk to a decorator about some changes she wanted made to the home, including structural changes. I am talking to the decorator about creating a very nice master suite with a luxurious master bath. I specified a whirlpool tub and for the shower I specified a bench seat and making it a steam shower. I wondered about talking to him about a sauna but decided against it, thinking that what I had already specified would be sufficient. They also wanted to expand their garage. I walked him out to the garage, which was one-car only. It was completely empty. I told him that all four members of the family have their own car. The outer wall of the garage is the wall that was attached to the retail store so I didn't know how he would be able to expand it to house more than one car. The owners had not specified if they wanted it to house just one additional car or all four cars. The son had several friends spending the night. His bedroom is on the first floor. The daughter's bedroom in on the second floor but it is only accessible via a ladder and by going up this ladder you can only access her bedroom. The room ran the full width of the house though it was no wider than an average bedroom. There was a bed on each end. She had one friend spending the night and I was spending the night. The parents had decided I would sleep in the daughter's room. I could tell she was not too pleased about this. To try to make it easier I told her I would just sleep on the floor in the middle of the room. The son and his friends are in there watching TV but are also planning to sleep in there. The son has never kissed a girl before and he wants me to teach him how. I keep telling him that I can't do that but he tries once anyway. There is a square opening in the wall that is barely big enough for a person to fit through. It is an opening for a rectangular area with a diameter no bigger than the square opening. I crawl in there and lie down on my back intending to sleep in there away from the others. The son crawls in and I tell him he needs to get out. He tries again to kiss me. Then one of his friends crawls in. They finally both get out. The daughter's friend tells the parents that I am making out with the boys. I defend myself and tell them that it is not true, though I don't tell them what their son did. They don't believe me. The daughter has left the house because she was very upset about something unrelated. As soon as the parents hear that she is gone they panic and decide they are going out to try to find her. The son and I are going along. We are rushing around to find shoes and coats so we can leave. The son goes out on his own and comes back to tell his parents that he found her and she is dead. He found her floating on her back in the water behind the house. We all go out. It is dark out so we can barely see where we are walking. It is a steep hill so we lean back to try to keep our balance as we make our way down the steep embankment. We get to the bottom and the son shines a flashlight on his sisters' body. It hardly looks like her. She looks like she has been out there for a long time instead of a just a few hours. I only look for a few seconds because it is so disturbing. The inside of the house, the walls, the floors, the ceiling, is constructed with unfinished wood. The stairways are very unusual or are ladders. There is a pole that the boys use to go downstairs, sliding down as though it were a fireman's pole. There is a man there that I need to leave as soon as possible so they don't try to involve me in any of the drama. I follow him to get out and away. I'm now on a boat with this man, Frank B from Trading Spaces. There is still a problem. He realizes that we just need to get off of this boat. We create another kind of boat out of unfinished wood and poles. There are quite a few of us that get on and go off on our own. It has two levels but there are several sections on each level. As we're floating along the water, at times there is low hanging foliage that brushes the top of the boat, almost coming inside at times. We see things that we can eat. Since we have no food on the boat we start pulling these off the branches as we continue to move. We can't stop the boat. We don't know what some of the things are but we take them anyway. We also see bananas. As soon as we see those we begin grabbing those quickly so we can get as many as possible even though we know we shouldn't eat more than one day for good colon health. Someone in another section had seen and grabbed a bunch of strawberries. We're taking turns steering the boat. Someone tells me that it's time for me to take a break and get some rest. I climb up on a platform that is just big enough to lie down on. It is held in place by a wooden pole on each corner that is fairly small in diameter, maybe only 3 or 4 inches. But the platform seemed very sturdy. There was something laying on the platform and I just lay on top of it. As I was laying there I kept reaching for this stuff to make sure it didn't fall off. Frank was either sitting or laying on a platform underneath me. Someone said something to me that caused me to be concerned about his well-being. We were on this thing for quite some time. Frank and I became quite close and ended up getting married. We are in danger from someone that wasn't on either boat. We had to be very careful to keep everyone on the boat safe from the people on shore. Some of the people on the boat also became a threat. We had to be especially careful not to go in the sections of the boat where these people are. One person in the dangerous group knew me and Frank and didn't want to see us get hurt so he helped us to stay together and safe. Some of us had gotten off the boat and were in the water. I had several six-inch square pieces of paper with notes on them from Jennifer F. They were notes for her boyfriend. I was worried that they were going to get wet. I managed to get them in a plastic container that was almost exactly the same size as the papers. He was one of the people on the shore that we were in danger of. Yet, because he knew me, he was not doing anything to harm any of us. He essentially pretended not to see us."

"1530"	"(2007-01-27)"	"I had a very bad headache. It occurred to me that I had read about someone having a dream about a way to get rid of a headache by pressing their fingers together. I decided to try it but then I couldn't remember which finger they used to press against their thumb. I thought it was the third finger so I started by trying that one. After only a few seconds I changed to my second finger and then to the first. Finally, I used all three at once. I was disappointed that it wasn't helping but then decided it was just because I didn't remember how to do it correctly."
"1531"	"(2007-01-28)"	"I had gone to an office to talk to someone I knew about helping me find a job. I went into an office building and entered a pair of glass doors into an office suite. In the middle of an open area, there was a man sitting at a desk facing the door. I told him I was looking for Richard Walker [unknown in waking life] . He nodded his head toward a man sitting at a desk to my right. The man's back was to me. When he heard his name he turned around. I realized it wasn't the Richard Walker I was looking for. I raised the palm of my hand toward him and apologized, saying, I'm sorry, wrong Richard Walker. Somewhere before this I saw Al H there, realizing that he was running this office. I think we said hello to each other but nothing more. He was working at a large desk and personal work space to my left as I stood facing inside the office. As I turned to leave and opened the door he called me and asked me to come back in for a minute. I suppose he knew I was looking for a job. I stood in front of his desk as he started asking some questions about my job search. I told him that I am currently working but looking for something more suitable in job role and in salary. He asked me what salary I was looking for. As he did I noticed him write down $68,000. However, it was not $68,000 even. I just can't remember the last three numbers. I told him that he knows that I can't name a salary because there is too much involved that impacts that number. He said yes he realized that but asked me to give him a ballpark number anyway. After hesitating for a few seconds I finally said it would have to at least be between $65,000 and $70,000. I sat down in a chair in front of his desk. Richard Walker was sitting in a chair next to me but sitting at an angle where I could barely see any of his face. Al H asked his opinion about offering me a job and he said he couldn't offer an unbiased opinion because he knows me. As he said this he turned so I could see his face and I realized that it wasn't the Richard Walker that I was looking for. It was actually Randy M. I was very upset that Randy M was involved in this discussion, partially because he knows very little about me professionally and partially because I had not wanted to see Randy M again. When I was ready to leave Randy M said he was going to walk me to my car. I really didn't want him to but I couldn't say that in front of Al H. As we walked to the car he was acting the same toward me as always. I was trying to be polite, but not encourage any of the same type of treatment that I have received from him in the past. We are in a car together, he is driving. I am naked, lying back in the front passenger seat and trying to cover myself with my arms and hands. I'm feeling agitated and frustrated. I see a truck driver looking down into the car at me and say that I don't like that truck drivers can see down into cars. I am trying to put my bra on while still keeping myself covered. Randy M keeps looking over at me and grinning and I keep telling him to just keep his eyes on the road."
"1532"	"(2007-01-30)"	"Matthew was with me. I was trying to find the church that I take our parish's donations to. They have a little white shed for missions behind their church. I was having trouble finding it. In part of it we were in a car, I was driving. Part of it we were walking through a building. We ended up in a Methodist church. We were sitting in one of the pews during a service. I told Matthew that grandma used to be a Methodist and that their services are very similar to that of a Catholic Mass. We were in an office. We walked down a long hall and into an office directly at the end of the hall. We were looking for someone by a specific name, though I can't remember the name now. We wanted to buy a KTC card. When we walked into his office he was on the phone. He acknowledged us and ended his phone call. When I told him why we were there he looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about. After I said something else he said, yes, yes, and started shuffling through the piles of papers on his desk. I realized that we must be the first ones to buy one from him. They had just reopened the company and just beginning to market them again. He was obviously not prepared as I appeared to be the first person requesting to purchase one."
"1533"	"(2007-02-01)"	"I was going to Uncle P's visitation. I walked into the room up a middle aisle between rows of chairs that had been set up. I got halfway to the casket and stopped. It didn't even look like him. I was taken aback by how different he looked. I remembered seeing a picture of him at Christmas and I never would have known it was him if someone hadn't told me. He looked so different because of his illness."
"1534"	"(2007-02-01)"	"I was hosting an event for a group of women in my home. Two of the women were there to help me set up. One of them arrived a little earlier than the other and I had already talked to her about what needed to be done. I walked her to the room that I thought we should use because it had the most room to set up folding chairs. When the second one showed up I had to do the same thing again. I walked her to that same room and explained that I was intending to set up folding chairs in rows. I was motioning with my hands as I talked. We went into another room that looked like an attic storage area except that it had very high ceilings, like a warehouse. There was something that resembled a ladder that led to the lower floor. The lower floor also looked like a warehouse. There were things on this upper level that we needed to take to the lower level, I think they were all empty boxes. On the lower level there were things that needed to be taken to the upper level. I said something about this being temporary, through the holiday season. The things on the lower level had things that I had moved for or replaced with holiday decorations. Some of the things on the lower level were empty boxes from Christmas decorations. We were running out of time and we still had very much to do. I began standing at the bottom of the ladder and just pushing these things up to get them on the upper floor so someone up there could move them to the area where they needed to be stored. I needed time to take a shower because I was getting so hot and sweaty moving these boxes. I was concerned that I wouldn't have time for a shower."

All of the checkout lines were long. Cardboard displays of toys by registers. One had small, 6 x 3 boxes of little stuffed dolls, mostly twins. I decided to buy two of them for the twins, one pink and one yellow, each looked slightly different. I decided I needed to buy something for Kaitlyn S as well. Ended up buying eight or ten items. Cashier in a wheelchair. A teenager on probation. Walked me home to show me a shortcut. Walked Uncle H's house in my mother's hometown. He and Aunt R alive and healthy. He was exercising and body looked very young and toned. Aunt R healthy and lost much weight. Looked beautiful. Aunt J also alive and healthy. Lost weight and looked young and beautiful. Wondered how this would make Mother feel, to be the only one still overweight. Uncle H's house. Went to his garage to fix my bicycle. Started to rain so I opened the main garage door. There was only enough room for me to barely step inside and move my bicycle barely inside. I was going to add air to the tires but then realized the tires were completely removed. They were going to Wal-mart and taking Susan W and Debbie Wo along so I went too, planning to buy new tires for my bike as Uncle H had suggested. Aunt R and the girls were in the backseat so I reached to open the front seat. Uncle H moved some things off the seat onto the floor. There wasn't much room for my feet. As I got in he told me I could sit in the backseat on the way home. I was embarrassed and said that was fine. I thought Since Aunt R had gotten in the back seat they intended for me to sit in the front but I was obviously wrong. Now numerous other relatives there. We never did go to Wal-Mart. The house is now Linda W and Dick W's house. Several relatives want to help me market myself online to help me successfully establish myself in a new profession. Mostly it was younger relatives, like newly out of college, who were helping. I trusted them and was glad to have the help. I walked away from everyone else with BJ and tried to tell her my latest news about my degree. Unfortunately someone overheard me."
"1540"	"(2007-02-13)"	"I went to BR Park with a female friend. While there, I went to use a bathroom. The stalls were made of wood but the walls were the same height as a normal bathroom stall. Each stall had two toilets and were outdoors. When I went into a stall Malachi B was in there. I pretended not to know him because I found it embarrassing enough to have to share a stall with someone, let alone a man and someone I know. There was a rundown golf course. No one used it anymore because the park had discontinued maintaining it. My friend and I took a ball and a putter and were walking the course, just putting from the greens. It still wasn't easy because it was in such bad condition. We weren't being very successful getting it into the hole. A man came up to us and said something to us about being on the course. He apparently thought we shouldn't be there. We said we didn't think it mattered to the park maintenance people and the condition didn't bother us. I hit one ball that went way past the hole, off the green, in a straight line, and ended near a wooded area. Some well-known man came up to the green we were on and putted into that hole. The ball went just past the hole, did a u-turn, and then rolled right into the hole. I couldn't believe it and was thinking that was a very skillful shot that he had developed. Later in the day I went to use the bathroom again and again Malachi B was in the stall I went in. He immediately looked up and recognized me and said hello. I sat down and we talked. He was holding a newspaper up, as he had been reading it. I was hoping he would leave so I could use the toilet in privacy. He got a call on his cell phone and answered it. He was talking to his sister about a program he was doing in the city that evening. She was supposed to come and help him but she called to tell him that she wouldn't be able to. After he got off the phone he said something about who had called and why. I told him I would be happy to help him. He looked at me as if to ask why. I told him that I live very near there and I didn't have any plans for that evening. I also said that, besides, it would be a good learning opportunity for me as I feel that I could always learn something from him. I mentioned that his was one of the dream course syllabi that I referenced when creating my own. I smiled when I told him that from the looks of his syllabus I thought he was pretty demanding, because of all the reading he requires, and all scientific papers no less. He finally did accept my offer to help with his program."

"1542"	"(2007-02-17)"	"I am with my sister, though not a waking life sister. She is tall, thin, and has long, black hair. We are riding in a convertible with someone else unknown driving. My sister is sitting on the front of the car facing the back with her legs hanging down into the inside of car. We are in my mother's home state, driving on I-74 towards CO where the landscape along both sides of the highway is just hills and trees. My sister has a gun. It appears to be a rapid-fire rifle. She is shooting into the hills as we drive. There was highway construction. The woman who has driving said something to my sister but my sister disagreed with her. Still, I thought they got along very well and seemed to compliment each other. The woman mentioned her therapist and my sister decided that maybe she should go see that therapist. We went to the apartment of the woman who was driving. Her and my sister entered the building before me. By the time I got in the building I didn't see either of them and wasn't sure where to go. I was standing facing a long hallway. There was an apartment to my left where the door was on a wall that angled away from me. The door was open and the inside was fully lit. I stepped to the door and realized that was not the correct apartment. About halfway down the hall was another apartment to my left with its door open and lights on inside. I went all the way inside that one until some man came out of another room and I realized I was in the wrong apartment. I rushed out. At the end of the hall was a third apartment to my left with the door partially open and some light coming out. I went in that one and was finally in her apartment. My sister and I were going to be spending the night so we were talking about where we would each sleep. She had a very long sofa, about ten feet in length, that was angled at each end. My sister suggested that she and I could sleep there, each at one end. The woman suggested that my sister could share her bed but my sister didn't me to have to sleep on the sofa when they both would be in a bed. I said I was fine with that and said that I knew while we were still in the car that the two of them would get together eventually. Two men and two of us women trying to sleep next to each other on a shell-shaped piece of furniture. A man laid down next to me and we immediately realized that all four of us wouldn't fit there. We still considered trying. I walk out of my bedroom at my birth home and there is a young man, tall, with black hair, standing at the stove with his back to me. He was standing there completely naked and removing groceries from brown paper bags. I stood there silent wondering who he was and why he was standing there naked. He must have heard me walk into the room because he turned completely around. I gasped and he said, what? I knew it was Mother's boyfriend, but I don't know how I knew that. I was furious. I rushed outside and got in her very expensive new car. I backed out into the road and then back into a grassy field on the same side of the road. I put the car in drive, got back onto the road, then hit the gas hard, and sped off. Mother comes to the woman's apartment when all of the neighbors are there. There are a number of people naked in a hot tub. Mother removes her clothes and gets in the hot tub. I can't believe she did that. The other people all think it's great that she is so uninhibited that she is willing to do that at her age. She couldn't keep her head above the water. I reached under her arms to try to hold her up but she would slide right out of my hands and back under water. One of the men in the hot tub moved towards her and held her up so she wouldn't keep going under. My brother Brian F showed up at 3 am wanting help picking up some kind of equipment. BJ was fine helping. When I went outside I saw that he had also gotten John S to come and help. More activity with apartment neighbors. One of the people there was the woman's ex-husband. They didn't get along well at all. Later I found out it was all an act, that they were working together, putting on this act, to get something they otherwise wouldn't be able to."
"1543"	"(2007-02-17)"	"I went to Sears looking for a particular type of toy. It was a four-inch clear square box with something inside it. I knew some people might think it was something for Christmas but I knew it wasn't. I also knew it had something in common with another type of toy and if I mentioned that toy to people working at the store they would know what I was talking about. I asked one employee and at first he just said they didn't have it. Then I mentioned the other toy and he nodded his head yes and said I could find it on the ground floor. I walked off thinking that I could just take the escalator to the ground floor but after taking the escalator down two levels it ended there and didn't go down to the ground level. I kept trying to find the way myself. I finally asked an employee and they gave me directions."
"1544"	"(2007-02-18)"	"I was sent to temp at CAS on Friday. I don't know if they had given Bill C the name of the temp they were sending or not. I don't know why, but I went in to work wearing a pair of dark green sweatpants and a grey t-shirt. The office looked different than in waking life. There were two adjacent walls to the suite that were all glass. Instead of entering into a reception area, the suite door led into a large, open office area that had six or eight desks. I arrived for work, sat down at one of the desks and started working. There was a glass window on one of the walls of Bill C's office. I could see him in there and I'm sure he saw me come in but he didn't come out. The entire time I was there he didn't speak a word to me or vice versa. It was very uncomfortable. I was debating whether or not I should be the one to break the ice and go in and talk to him. Before I decided to do anything I realized that he was getting ready to leave to meet Jane C and go somewhere. It almost seems as though they were attending a wake or funeral. Jane C met him in the lobby of the office building as did someone else they knew. The third person was a little person, a woman I think. I was thinking how odd it looked to see a little person with Bill C and Jane C since they are both so extraordinarily tall. I went out to my car to get something and saw that Bill C was still there getting something from his car. Terry D pulled up parallel to Bill C's car and was waiting for Bill C. Apparently Bill C was going somewhere with Terry D. Bill C took a call on his cell phone, standing outside his car. I walked up to the passenger side of Terry D's car and leaned over to look in the window. He saw me coming, rolled the window down and leaned over to talk to me. He asked me how I was doing and before I could answer said something to the effect of judging by my mood I was doing okay or pretty well. He asked what I was doing these days, professionally. I told him I was teaching two classes at U of I. I don't know why I said that because he already knew that. I told him I was teaching a class somewhere else as well, I think ITI. Then I told him I was also doing temp work. I didn't tell him why I was there that day and he didn't ask. I started back to the office and decided to go back and ask him if he thought I should try to talk to Bill C. I got to his car and asked if I could ask him something. He hesitated for just a second, shrugged his shoulders and said sure. As soon as he did that I realized I was asking him for free advice and I shouldn't be doing that. I asked him anyway. Before he could answer Bill C started towards his car so I left and went back into the office. I went to use the women room. When I came out there was a young man standing bent over at the waist, with one or both arms resting on a banister or half-wall. He had a grin on his face. I didn't know him but thought it was curious that he was standing there and especially curious that he was standing there alone, not talking on a phone or anything, no one around, but he had a grin on his face. I went back into the office and there were now three or four other employees there. One was a young woman and the others were all young men. I just sat down at my desk and started working again. The man from outside the women room came in and sat down at a desk behind me. After just a minute or two he threw a large white-coated paperclip at me. As it hit me He got up and walked to the front of the rows of desks. There were two of the other employees, one woman and one man, working at the desks in the row to my right and one working at a desk in front of me. He asked some very rude, sarcastic question about my sweatpants and the way they fit. He was moving around very dramatically, talking in a loud voice and laughing. I picked up the thing that he threw at me, it reminded me of a white artist eraser, and threw it at him but missed because someone else was in the way. I knew I should not have been dressed the way I was but that didn't give them the right to treat me this way. I gathered up my personal notebook and handbag and walked out of the office. It was raining outside but at the moment it didn't even bother me much that I didn't have an umbrella. Between the double rows of parking spaces were strips of grass with a few young trees in each. The trees weren't more than eight feet tall. Late Monday morning Bill C called. My stomach was in knots, just hearing his voice and knowing I had to talk to him now, and because I was pretty sure why he was calling. He identified himself and asked if he was mistaken or if I was supposed to be there again today to finish the task he hired me to do. I told him I had not intended to come back today because of what happened with his employees on Friday. He wanted to know what happened but I didn't really want to tell him, partially because I didn't want to discuss my mistake in dressing the way I did, but partially because I didn't want to discuss the way I was treated, for his employees sake or mine. Though, I'm not sure he would have been upset with his employees. I also was simply very uncomfortable talking to him at all. I finally said as little as possible about what happened. He wanted to know who threw the paperclip at me and was saying things. I said I didn't know his name. He said three or four names of current employees and said that he had to know who it was to do anything about it. I didn't want him to do anything about it, but he kept pressuring me to describe the man. I finally told him that the man was a bit taller than me and fairly thin. His hair was brown or ash blonde and very short, cut with clippers close to his head for the most part. Those were the only identifying features I could come up with."

Vince P was very aloof; in fact, I'm not sure he spoke to me at all. Mostly I spoke to Sue P. After I greeted them at the door, they went into another area and began introducing themselves to some of the other guests. Doctor C and Sara C also came. I was very happy to see him and spent some time talking with him and catching up. A light bulb had gone out in the fixture above the food table. Matthew climbed up on a chair to change it and placed one foot on one of the long sides of the table as he reached for the burned out bulb. The table began to tip slightly. I was standing on the other side of the table so I grabbed it quickly to balance it and keep it from going over. He didn't put all of his weight on it, just enough to steady himself as he reached for the bulb."
"1553"	"(2007-03-01)"	"I was looking for an apartment with Bill F. An employee of one apartment complex was driving us around in a golf cart to show us the different types of units but also to show us some of the features offered by the community. I looked up and saw a second floor walkway to several apartments that I remembered seeing before. I remembered either that Jo V had lived there or moved in there or that I had thought about moving in there, or that I had been there before. I'm not sure which. But I remember it from another dream even though in the dream I thought it was something I remembered from waking life. There was a rectangular shaped cement pond just outside of one of the buildings. At night they put a tarp over it and a blanket and the employee that was working the overnight shift slept on it. There was a wood, plank bridge along one of the long sides of the pond. It had ropes along the sides to hold on to as you cross. It was very shaky and I did not like walking across it. It was getting late, starting to get dark and I wanted to go home. One of the employees said something that led me to believe that we were expected to spend the night as a way of trying the community out before making a decision. After the employee left, Bill F and I decided to try to figure out a way to get back home without the employees finding out."
"1554"	"(2007-03-04)"	"It was my first day back to work at CAS after a few week leave of absence. I went into the office building. The office was on the second floor, unlike in waking life. I decided to take the stairs rather than the elevator. As I got to the top, I looked toward the CAS office and couldn't see the receptionist desk like I usually can. The front wall is all glass, though in the dream the wall was about twice as long as in waking life. I wondered why I couldn't see the receptionist desk. There was a lot of sun shining in through an outdoor window so at first I thought that was why I couldn't see it. As I got closer to the office suite door I realized I couldn't see the receptionist desk because they had put up a partial fabric wall, the type that is sometimes used to create cubicles in offices, all along the front glass wall to hide employee desks. Even so, they no longer had a receptionist or reception desk. I went in and walked behind the wall. They had two or three rows of desks with two or three desks in each row. Bryan N was working at one of them. Bill C had made these changes while I was away so I didn't know where he wanted me to work now. Bill C came out of his office and walked me to the desk where he wanted me to work. There was one row of desks in between the one where Bryan N was working and the one where I would be working. He sat down at the desk and began doing something on the computer. He realized there was a problem and was becoming very aggravated. As always, he began snapping at me. I realized that he and Bryan N had made some changes to the computers while I was gone and what they did was causing problems. Bill C realized this wouldn't have happened if I had done this and he always hates it when I can do something that he can't, especially if he decides to do something different than what I recommend and it ends up not working out or causing a problem. His way of dealing with it is to get angry with me. I realized that it was not the computer I had before I left and suspected that was part of the problem. Bill C denied that it was a different computer. I could tell by the look on Bryan N's face that something was up and then he asked what difference it would make. I told him that my old computer was built to handle the capacity of all the software I need to do my job. Then he admitted that he had taken my old computer because he knew it was better than the one he had been using. Now he was upset because he had to give my computer back and because he had been caught. He was being rude and snappy as he prepared to switch the computers back. Bill C was acting as he always did when he didn't want to acknowledge something. The office is also much longer than in waking life. There are a number of large rooms as you walk the length of the office. Bill C had hired quite a few people. He had hired three just to manage training materials and to conduct training in our office."
"1555"	"(2007-03-05)"	"I was doing SAID work at the computer for an event other than conference. I went to a store to do some shopping. I was looking for candleholders in the right shade of purple that would match something someone else was doing for the event. I happened to see that person at the store so I picked up a purple candleholder and took it over to her to get her opinion as to how good of a match it was. She wasn't sure. There were large and long rectangular pieces of fabric hanging from the ceiling. They were a rainbow of colors, including two shades of purple hanging next to each other. I pointed to them and asked her if she could tell if one of those was the right shade. She said the lighter one, which was lavender. I didn't think that was right but said okay and went and got two lavender candleholders. The first two that I had picked up were about four or six inches in diameter and about three inches deep. The lavender ones were square with slightly rounded corners. They were about 2 inch square. Even though I didn't think they were the right color, based on what I remembered seeing, I picked up two of them. I was walking through the store to look for some other things and I saw the other woman again talking to someone. I waited until she was free and then walked up to her and told her I just wanted to make sure I had the right shade."

The one he had saved for me looked just like and it didn't. The stone in it was a couple of inches high, reminding me almost of an obelisk. The stone was ruby red, just like the stones in our class rings. I was thinking about the fact that we never did get that first date that he wanted so long ago. I was actually kind of happy about the possibility of finally spending some time with him and seeing how we would get along."
"1558"	"(2007-03-08)"	"Vince P arrived at public event that I was helping to host. I was sitting behind a rectangular table, the heavy steel, fold-up kind, six feet long. It was a registration or welcoming area. He walked up to someone else sitting behind this row of tables. I'm sure he saw me, but he quickly looked away. I said, Vince P. It's good to see you. I've tried to reach you a number of times over recent years and you haven't returned my calls. He looked at me and again looked away. I told him that I sensed there was an issue between us and I'd like to find out what it is. I told him that if I did something wrong or hurtful I wanted to make it right."
"1559"	"(2007-03-11)"	"My Personal War. In the presence of his family, a man I had been dating asked me to marry him. It almost seems as though it is Marshall E. We were sitting side-by-side on a sofa, with him to my right. He turned his body sideways to better face me, pulled out an engagement ring, and proposed. I quickly glanced around the room at the members of his family and they all seemed very pleased by this. I was quite taken aback, not expecting this proposal at all. I hesitated, unsure that I loved him, or at least unsure that I loved him enough to marry him. Now there was some kind of battle going on outside. Someone helped us escape the danger. We were outside running away from it, running on patterned cement with flecks of color in it. When we got to a certain point, we knew we were free. We all then split up and went our separate ways. I am in a house with a number of people. They are bringing people inside who are injured. The man, Marshall E, who asked me to marry him, is one of them. They have the injured people laying on something, I don't know if it is tables, beds, or gurneys. There are white, sheer curtains covering all of the windows. I and another woman are each standing at opposites sides of a window and move the curtains just enough with our hands to be able to see outside. The building is surrounded by the military and everyone out there is engaged in active fire. I hate this. I hate violence. I'm thinking about Marshall E. I haven't gone over to him since they brought him in. I feel like I should, but I'm concerned that if I do he will read something into it. I haven't given him an answer yet to his proposal. I still don't know how I feel and if I want to say yes.  There is another injured man in there that they know is not going to survive. Someone goes over to him, reaches into the injured man's stomach with his hands, and pulls out one of his internal organs. He then takes the organ over to Marshall E and puts it in him. This is going to save Marshall E's life. I think I end up leaving with Marshall E."

"1565"	"(2007-03-24)"	"The main scenario kept repeating. It seems that everyone, or maybe just some of us, knew it was going to keep repeating, though we didn't realize it was a dream. Certain elements would change each time. Sometimes things would change because people would choose to do things differently than they did the last time. The basis for the choices varied between personal reasons, right and wrong, good and bad, socially acceptable or not, and morals and ethics. Most of the choices seemed to be about relationships or the choices were made recognizing the impact on some relationships or to avoid impact on some relationships. At times, it wasn't until after the fact that the impact on someone else was brought to someone's attention. Sometimes this resulted in them choosing differently the next time and others times the same choices were made. At least once the choice was simply to have a different attitude. Following that, the people involved were discussing how positively it impacted the entire scenario - something that was considered threatening, a monster, was now non-threatening and helpful. The entire planet was being wiped out by water in a flood type event. The water was dark, murky, and muddy. All of the survivors, most of the time, seemed to be on one ship."

Two of the cars were luxury cars, the same make and model but different colors and one was a ""gold"" edition of that model. I really wanted to win one of them. A customer I had been talking with had left but I saw through a window that she was coming back. I realized that she had won both of the luxury cars. She was in her late sixties or early seventies, with very short blonde hair, styled in a manner that you might expect for someone of her age. She asked me if I would go with her to claim the two cars and drive one of them to her home. I agreed and went into to change my clothes before going with her. While I was changing, she left and came back with her male hair stylist. She told one if my male coworkers that she no longer needed me to go with her. Her stylist was going instead. He was a man in his early or mid thirties, very thin build, with short, choppy, blonde hair. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't want me to go now. I was looking forward to driving one of those particular cars. I walked up to her and her stylist and said something to her about her hair. It was shoulder-length, full, kind of frizzy looking. I said something to her about the color of her hair being similar to mine, while lifting a some strands of mine up close to hers. The stylist disagreed, saying that hers was more yellow-blonde while mine is more ash blonde. He said something about how she styles her hair as he touched it here and there. I was surprised that it looked this way on purpose."

I was in the middle of a conversation or doing something with someone else when Ben D came in. I may have been playing a game of some sort. I was pleasantly surprised to see him and wanted very much to greet him immediately but knew that I had to finish whatever it was that I was involved in. As time passed, I kept watching him interacting with others and wishing it were me. I began to fear that he would leave before I had an opportunity to talk with him. Something happened that had put me in danger. Some of the people in attendance were discussing this and trying to figure out what to do. It seems that mostly they were afraid to do anything. About that time, I noticed that Ben D had crawled into a small, dark opening above the gas tank. [Huge horizontal gas tank people used to use to heat their homes.] I realized that he was preparing to attack the person who was trying to harm me. I overheard someone talking about some physical skill he has that he was intending to use to do this. I was surprised and impressed about this skill, but also flattered that he would make this effort to protect me. Ben D and I spent an entire day together, just doing ordinary things. We both had such a nice time. I knew I would like to do this many, many more times, but wouldn't allow myself to even think about that because I knew it would never happen."

We were having a nice conversation as were walking outside. It must have been winter as I was wearing winter gloves. I decided to take them off, but I don't know why. As we walked, he was rubbing one of my hands. When we arrived back at the lecture hall, I sat near the back, or top. It was a huge hall. I made my way to the end because I wanted to sit off by myself since I was just there to observe him teaching. There wasn't much room. He was talking to the class and then began singing. He was singing a love song. As he continued to sing, he started walking towards me. Then he walked up to wear I was sitting and stood right in front of me as he continued to sing, while looking only at me. As he finished the song, he reached for my hand. I was touched and flattered, and embarrassed. I felt very attracted to him. One of the students made a comment about not paying to be sung to, or to sit through him singing a song to one individual. Doctor Pi asked the student if he had just criticized the university that he represents and works to teach him through, or if he was just having a bad day. The student then looked embarrassed and said that he was having a very bad day."

Matthew was much younger. Conversations with neighbors. Looking outside and realizing that I am still getting used to where I am now living. I forgot that it is a very short walk, across something that resembles a large, gravel parking lot, to a number of small stores. I asked him if he wanted to walk across this large gravel area to a convenience store and get a popsicle. I took some change from my wallet and placed it in my pocket. Popsicle in my pocket. The first one partially melted but I ate it anyway. A second and third one completed melted. None of the three had been in wrappers. Tennis courts surrounded by chain link fence. People playing on one of them. Different people playing on them now. I decided to walk down one small street that was lined with small shops, and then go home and make a list of the shops that were there that we might want to visit the future. The list was to remind us that they were there so we wouldn't get in the car and drive to other stores for the same thing. Driving down a narrow country road that was hardly big enough for two cars. It had been raining. Lots of water puddles. Some I tried to avoid. Mostly I tried to drive very slowly so the water wouldn't splash up on the car. I mostly didn't want it to splash on the windshield. I realized I slowly I was driving and wondered if there were any cars behind getting aggravated with me. When I turned around to look there were no other cars there. At that point, it also felt more as if I was walking."

I was thinking about things that I sold and feeling very sad that I had sold some of the things that I had. In particular, I had sold the turntable that Matthew just bought me for my birthday. I was feeling very upset about that, because at the time I wasn't even thinking about the fact that it was a gift from Matthew. He didn't know that I had sold it and I didn't want him to know.

Macy F, Vince P, Tim R, and I were sharing one large room. There was a partition, or a wall, that separated the men's beds from ours. The younger male had gotten a separate room for himself. We had been out somewhere and came back to the hotel. All five of us were in the larger room. All but the younger male were sitting on Vince P or Tim's bed talking. Macy F and I were sitting at the foot of the bed and they were sitting at the head of the bed. I was getting really tired and sleepy so I laid down, on my side, but tried to keep myself awake to continue to participate in the conversation. As we continued to talk, each of the others did the same thing. We were each stretched out. By alternating body positions, we all fit in the bed. Tim R had been drinking, quite a bit. He sat up and reached for another drink. Vince P was trying to stop him because he knew Tim R had already had too much. Tim R wouldn't give up the drink so Vince P got a glass of milk and was trying to get him to alternate between the alcohol and the milk. Apparently, this was a common occurrence with Tim R. When I realized that I wondered if that had anything to do with my feeling of discomfort with him since I met him. I hadn't been able to identify why he made me uncomfortable. Maybe it had something to do with this type of behavior. Macy F and I decided to go with the young man to his room to get away from Tim R. Just before we left the room Tim R went over to my bed and started vomiting all over my bed, over and over. Macy F left and went into the other man's room. Something sexual happened after going into his room."

While he was checking in, I excused myself, telling him that I needed to use the restroom. What I actually did was sneak into another hotel room. I hadn't had a chance to shave that morning and I wanted to do that before we went to our room. I knew it wouldn't take me that long so I thought I could get in and out without anyone knowing. The room I snuck into was a suite of several bedrooms and each had a private bathroom. While I was using their bathtub to shave, the whole family that had reserved that room arrived. The couple whose bathroom I was using came in and realized someone was in there. I somehow managed to get out without anyone from that family seeing me. There was a big ordeal between the time that they realized I was in there and the time I actually got out unseen. I was at a computer screen and there were several columns of information, each were a different category yet all were related to the time Ben D and I were going to spend together. I was trying to decide on which three columns I wanted for that time."

I was pushing some of the carts in the parking lot further into the cart corral so they weren't in the aisle where people need to drive. They weren't in people's way so they wouldn't hit them or whatever. As I was doing that, Julie D walked up and asked me what I was doing there. I don't recall my response. She told me that I need to be at home. My CRHP sisters knew that I had been at home sick that day, that I had called in to work to say I wasn't going in because I was sick. I had been at home all day, but I wasn't sick. When I spoke to Julie D, I was trying to make myself sound sick. I went into the store and told her that I was there with Matthew, and would only be there a few minutes before returning home. That wasn't our intention, though. I sat and talked with her for a few minutes, sitting on a bench. I told her I needed to go find Matthew so I could get back home. I went and found Matthew. He didn't want to go. He didn't want to hurry. I told him that Julie D had seen me, and we had talked briefly, so I couldn't stay. I decided I could stay long enough to get some chocolate. I kept pestering Matthew about going home. I finally suggested that if I was going to stay I should be using one of the carts that is a scooter. That way if I ran into Julie D again, she might be more likely to believe that I am sick."

When he heard this, he became very upset, got up, and walked away. I jumped up and went after him. He didn't want to talk to me. I felt as though he wanted nothing more to do with me ever. I kept trying to convince him that what they said is no longer true. That I have worked hard at changing that old, negative behavior. I asked him if we couldn't at least talk about it. He sat down in a chair with his arms folded across his chest in a very closed-body, defiant position. It didn't seem that he was going to hear or believe anything I had to say. I don't know if he was so angry because of the actual old behavior or because I didn't tell him about it. I kept saying that I continue to work on it and continue to make progress.

It's not that the others are faceless, but for some reason only this one stuck in my mind. He was sitting in a chair with his left hand at his head or face, maybe with his head resting against his hand. He had dark-colored hair, almost black. It was not thick, very straight, layered, parted in the middle, and a little longer than most men wear their hair. In the front, it hung down across his forehead, like bangs."

All of the other houses along these same few blocks are complete and the homeowners have become friends. Wes S and I have both met everyone, so we have not integrated into the group yet. The group participates in a number of activities together. Some of it is community service. Wes S and I are the only single people and neither of us have small children as the other families do. Some of the individuals are having relationships outside of their marriage with someone else in the same group. Wes S is moving in after I have. When I heard someone was moving into that house, I didn't initially know who it was. I see Wes S socializing with one of the other female homeowners and wonder if he is in a relationship with her, though later learn that he isn't. When he and I finally do meet again and talk, I find out that he is not in a relationship with anyone. It is late evening, dark outside, and we are standing outside his home, on a deck. He is leaning with his back against the railing and I am standing facing him, resting against his chest. He has his arms around my waist. Even though we are both single, he feels there is a reason why we cannot pursue a relationship. He is also planning to move again very soon. He tells me that he still loves me, that he will always love me. It seems this is painful for both of us, to have feelings for each other and not be able to be in a real relationship."

She said there was one close by and walked with me to show me where it was. She couldn't find it, so said we needed to go to another floor. Again, she couldn't find it so took me to yet another floor. We ended up in this huge open room that looked like a game arcade. One of us asked someone in there and they pointed us to the restroom. The mens and women rooms doors were side by side. They were brown doors that looked antique and very heavy. A child told me that I had to win a token of some kind to be able to get into the restroom. I had to have quarters to put into this machine to win the tokens and I needed two tokens because he told me I would need one to get out also. I started putting quarters in the machine but ran out. The young boy put some in for me and won two tokens right away, that he gave me to use for the women room. I went in several different rooms. Each one looked like some type of entertainment area, almost like areas of a casino. There were rows of chairs. The chairs appeared to be upholstered arm chairs. When I approached one I realized that they were all toilets. I had still not gotten to use the women room but I wasn't about to use one of these, especially not out in the open like everyone else was doing. There was another kind of competition going on. It seems that it was some type of wrestling. There was something that I wanted, I don't know if it was just to use the women room. It might have been that I just wanted to leave. But I knew if I participated in this wrestling match and won it would be the easiest way for me to get whatever it was that I wanted. I volunteered to compete but then learned that I needed to remove most of my clothing and I didn't want to do that. I decided I would anyway because whatever it was I wanted it that bad. Then a young black man came up and started undressing because he was going to compete before me. Someone was helping him undress. They pulled a shirt off over his head and there was another under it. They did this at least five times. Each one was a different color but they were all made the same. All these shirts gave him more time before he had to actually begin wrestling."
"1607"	"(2007-07-17)"	"I was getting dressed for a conference gala. "
"1608"	"(2007-07-18)"	"I was traveling with a man I knew to an event. [unknown] It may have been the SAID conference or some other SAID event. We were going to be traveling by bus, which we had not done before. Since we had not traveled this way before they were a number of things we weren't sure about. We thought we knew where the bus station was. Someone else we knew had told us that we needed to check some of our luggage ahead of time so we had done that. When it was getting close to time to leave, I went to the bus station a little earlier than the person I was traveling with. When I arrived at the location where I thought I needed to be, someone there told me that I needed to go somewhere else just a few blocks further from where I was. I was somewhat concerned about the time so I rushed to get there and wondered if my acquaintance would find it and get there on time. I got there and found out I had plenty of time so I quit worrying about my acquaintance. Earlier I had to ask someone about the location of a bank or ATM machine because I wanted to get some cash before I left. I don't know why we wouldn't have known our way around since we were getting ready to leave to go to the event. When it was time to leave the event and come home, we had to go to the exact same bus station that we went to in order to get to the event. At the event, I was sharing a room with two other people, neither of them the acquaintance that I had traveled with. For some reason I question if they were both women. I'm sure one of them was. One of them I knew, but not that well. The other I did not know as well. The room we were staying in was a large open area. One wall and part of each perpendicular wall connecting to it were all lined with a banquette. My roommates had a daily habit of showering in the evening, while I take my showers in the morning, when I am preparing to start my day. One evening I decided to take a shower and they were concerned that I was going to interfere with their schedule, that I would be in the shower when the first of them was ready to take theirs. It turned out not to be a problem. The next evening I decided to take a shower in the evening again because we were leaving early the next morning and I didn't want to have to get up that much earlier. Again, they were concerned that I was going to interfere with their schedule. While I was in the shower, one of them came in with me and started taking her shower at the same time. It was an extraordinarily large shower, especially in length, but I still was not happy that she had come in with me. I don't like anyone else seeing me naked. I know some people don't mind it in certain situations, like at a gym in a locker room, but I do mind. It makes me very uncomfortable. There were two containers, for lack of a better description, attached to the wall of the shower. They were oval with one straight edge where they connected to the wall. Each had lid that was hinged on the back and lifted to open, much like a toilet. They where both white. One was for dirty laundry. I can't remember now what the other one was for. When I undressed to take my shower, I put my clothes in that container. As I was showering, I remembered that this facility offered free laundry service. I thought that I should have taken advantage of that so I wasn't taking so much dirty laundry home. It would have made it a little nicer for me when I got home and unpacked, to not have quite so much laundry to do. I decided that, after I finished my shower, I would go get alot of my dirty laundry and send it to the laundry service that night because I knew they would return it in the morning before it was time for me to leave. When I went to get it and came back, the clothes I had put in that laundry container earlier were gone. I told my roommate that I had forgotten that the container empties itself from the bottom at set times throughout the day and that the things I had put in there earlier were now gone. I was trying to decide if I was still going to send any of my other things to the laundry service. There were several other people in our room now, waiting for us as we were getting ready. They were sitting on one end of the banquette, in the corner. At the other end, one of my roommates had things sitting on it and was using both angles to get ready. It seems that we were getting ready to attend a final event that evening, but at the same time doing everything we could tonight so we could get ready to leave quickly in the morning. When I am traveling, I usually do as much of my packing as I can the night before. Two of the people who were waiting were Shirley J and Brad G. Someone, other than my roommates, said I could have Brad G help me with anything I needed. I appreciated the idea of having someone help, but was uncomfortable asking Brad G. I didn't believe that he would want to help. He especially wouldn't want to help me. I finally decided I should ask him anyway. When I did, he agreed to do whatever it was that I asked, but then it was Shirley J who actually got up, walked over, and helped. I handed her a pile of papers and said I needed them to be hole-punched and put in a three-ring binder. I handed her a three-ring binder that was folded open, though the rings were closed. It had some papers in it and pile of papers lying loosely in it. I told her those papers also needed to be hole-punched and that binder needed to be prepared. She sat down along the side of a table, with her right side to the table, to do this for me. A young woman I knew was going to be going on a trip and taking a bus for the first time. She was unsure of where to go and was somewhat ill at ease just from the unknowing of not having done it before. I told her what I had learned from my first bus travel experience, especially about the luggage and where she needed to go to catch the bus. I told her that someone had given me slightly wrong information about the location so I didn't want her to make the same mistake. I found out that her mother was going to be traveling with her, but arriving at the bus station later, similar to my acquaintance and myself when we went. When her mother arrived at the bus station, they found out that they had quite a long wait until their bus arrived. They decided to take their swimsuits out of their luggage and go for a swim while they were waiting. They weren't concerned that they would be getting on the bus with wet hair and no makeup. They were playing together in the pool as you might expect from two teenagers, having a great time. The mother was the actress Sally Fields. I couldn't help but notice what good physical condition her body was in and was very envious as she is about ten years older than I am. I was thinking that my body was in very good condition twenty-five years ago, but even then I wore a size eight. I was never as small as she is and my stomach was certainly never that flat, just like a model."

"1611"	"(2007-07-24)"	"I was thinking (in the dream) about the things that sit on my nightstand and how they impact my sleep and my dreams. I was trying to figure out which things I could move. The little things that sit there are there because I want to use them every night and I'm afraid if I put them in the top drawer I will forget. Some of them I have gotten out of the habit of using. Still, I would like to get back in the habit of using them."
"1612"	"(2007-07-28)"	"Wes S is back again already. He is married but planning to divorce his current wife. This is his second marriage. Someone tells me that he has five children. I am quite surprised by that. Both his first and second wife knew of me, just in terms of my being a woman that he has always had some kind of feelings for, or some interest in. His second wife appears very young, she's petite, and has long blond hair. She knew less about me then his first wife, Julie Sa, because she had never seen nor met me. When I met his second wife for the first time she said, ahhhhh, so you are Anna. She went on to say that Wes S has always loved me and that she had heard so much about me. She also said that I was the only one that he ever really wanted to be with. He was not home at the time. It was late at night so she invited me to spend the night there. She was sharing a bed with their two young daughters and said I could sleep there as well. We were all for sleeping in that bed when Wes S came home. His birth family is a very prominent wealthy family in the community. He is divorced and living with his parents in his birth home. It is a very large, old home, but very well maintained. All of the woodwork inside is painted white as are the doors. There is a small foyer type area probably not much more than four feet in diameter, but is more octagonal in shape. I'm standing in this area turning around and counting all the doors. There are seven. I realize that one of them actually isn't a door but just looks like it, two are doors and two are closets, and the other four are doors to different rooms of the home. I am now in a large open room and his mother comes in. She appears very young and energetic for her age, with blond hair and a warm and welcoming smile. As she sees me, she raises her hand and waves and she says you must be Anna. She also says that she has heard so much about me and she is so glad to finally meet me. I tell her that I am also very glad to finally meet her. She is very warm and friendly and treats me like her own daughter. Wes S and I are planning to marry, and he and his family realize how frightening that is for me. They are being very warm, kind, and comforting, trying to help me feel less afraid. Wes S tells me that he may be interested in having a child with me. I am taken aback by this comment, partially because he already has five children, and partially because of our age. While I know I don't want any more children, I'm also afraid to tell Wes S this because I don't want to lose him again. I start thinking that it might not be so bad depending on how involved he is as a father. His mother tells me a story about a time when Wes S was younger and he had come home from a social event. He had several pages in his hands, each one with the words to a different song. He was flipping through them and when he got to one of them, he pulled it out and put it on the top of the stack. She asked him if that was the song that he danced to with me. She said he bashfully nodded his head yes, and went to his room. I am helping Wes S bring Christmas decorations downstairs to decorate inside and outside for the holiday. There is an area that almost seems like a small store yet has very few things in it to sell. I am slightly rearranging those things to make room for the Christmas decorations the young girl who was working there seems irritated by this. I try to disrupt things as little as possible. Wes S, his most recent wife, and I are on a road trip together. We have been driving for quite a while. It's early morning as we approach Las Vegas. Someone mentioned something about finding a place to stop for breakfast. I tell them that I was just recently at Las Vegas with my son and my brother and we found that many of the casinos offer breakfast buffets. His ex-wife looks at me with a disapproving look. I don't know if it's because she doesn't believe me, or because she doesn't want to go somewhere like that for breakfast. I was with mother and we were shopping for my wedding dress. At one store, I was trying on traditional white wedding dresses. I tried on several that had empire with waistlines and the bodices were very decorative with beads and sequins. I said something to someone working there about preferring a style with an empire waistline and an A-line skirt. She corrected my pronunciation of the word empire. I was thinking to myself that the first-time empire dresses were in fashion was before she was even born and before Stacy London had her own TV program telling people to pronounce it differently. However, I said nothing, and simply tried to remember to pronounce it her way. After trying several of the dresses on, there were three that I wanted to try on a second time because I was sure that one of those three was the one that I wanted. I still had to decide between the three of them and I wanted to be sure. It was getting close to time for the store to close, so one of the workers had begun carrying all the clothing to the back room. We couldn't find all of those three dresses again. She did find one of them, and helped me put it on again. I stepped into it but was having a very hard time getting it up over my hips. Mother told me that it was too small. I reminded her that I had no problem getting it on earlier. I continued to wiggle it one side at a time until I got it on. The girl who had been helping us also said something. Mother started looking at dresses on some of the other racks and found a gold beaded dress that she thought would look nice. I looked at it and agreed to try it on thinking that it wasn't so bad. I now had on a gold top and a pair of black pants. I ask the sales girl where the skirt was that went with this top, as I had it on earlier. She didn't seem to know what happened to it. I went to the back and looked at a few more of the formal dresses. I remembered that I have said for some time, that the next time I get married I intended to where a very elegant silver formal gown rather than a traditional white wedding dress. This store didn't have anything like that, so I decided to leave and look elsewhere. I am driving alone around the area of LS Mall. I realized, as I go to my right and across three lanes, that I am driving very dangerously and I need to be more careful for other people. I feel badly about the way I was driving. I turned right onto what I believe is an entrance road to the shopping mall. As soon as I do, I realize that I turned at the wrong place. I continue driving through parking lots hoping that I can get to the mall without going back on to the main street. While zigzagging around a number of buildings and parking lots I do finally get to the mall parking lot. I am with a young girl who used to work at a women's clothing store. She feels sure that this store will have exactly what I'm looking for. We walked into the store and it was empty. There were no racks, no merchandise, and no people. She makes the comment that they shouldn't be running the store this way. I'm confused, because it doesn't even appear to me to beat a store. She walks through a dark doorway and I follow her. It takes us into another empty room, where she again walks through a darkened doorway at the back of the room that leads us into yet another identical room. Each time she enters one of these room she looks around to see if one of the employees are there. Each time it is just another empty room. This happens at least a dozen times. The rooms are not all in a straight line, making it feel a bit like a maze. This makes me feel very uneasy and claustrophobic. I'm getting very nervous. We finally enter a very large room that looks like a large office space full of individual cubicles. There are women working at several of the cubicles who see us come in and acknowledge the girl that I am with. She says something to them about no one being around and about the fact that she brought me there to look for a wedding dress. "
"1613"	"(2007-07-28)"	"After 22 years, I finally decide to give Darren a second chance. Mostly I feel okay about this, but it doesn't seem to take much to shake my confidence and make me wonder if I'm doing the right thing. We are moving into a townhouse in the same community where Matthew lives. We are trying to combine the contents of two households into this townhouse. I get frustrated with some of the junk, in my opinion, that Darren has kept and is trying to move into our home. I finally decide that a lot of this stuff can go in a room in the basement and that will be his space for all of this kind of thing. There was also something about getting our trailers close to the door and other people's vehicles being in the way."
"1614"	"(2007-07-29)"	"I was taking a shower. The shower curtain closed in on me. I was struggling to push it away so it wasn't touching me, so I had room to take a shower. It had formed a complete circle, as though it were on a circular rod. I was at home in my own shower, but there were women standing outside the shower, at least two of them were Sisters from OLGM. It might have been Sister Betty and Sister Toni. One of them showed me a different setting on the massage head that I had not known about. "
"1615"	"(2007-07-30)"	"I bought a small home and was doing some minor renovations before I moved in. Daddy was there to help me. as were Albert S and Dwight W. We were walking around the house talking about the things that needed to be done. It was a two-story home. Daddy asked if I had a flashlight. I hesitated and then said I was pretty sure I had one in my car. Before I had a chance to go get it a couple of other things were mentioned, like light bulbs and toilet paper. I thought I should just drive to my current home and pick up a number of things and come back. Mother and another woman close to her age came in. The five of us were standing in one room talking. Dwight W mentioned something about how he and Albert S treated me in grade school versus how we get along now. He walked up behind me, bent over a bit since he is quite a bit taller than I am, rested his chin on my shoulder, and put his arms around me as he talked. Everyone was smiling and chuckling as he said something about how well we get along now. I didn't find it amusing, but told him that was his good fortune. Before I left, I asked if they thought it would be possible to create a separate doorway into the master bedroom. Right now, the only entry was through a second bedroom, which would be my daughter's room. I didn't want to have to go through her bedroom all the time to get to mine. There were only two bedrooms in the house. It was an older home. The wall they would need to put the doorway was currently covered with dark paneling. They didn't seem to think it would be a problem.

"1616"	"(2007-08-01)"	"I was at the SAID conference. I had spent the night with Ben D. We were getting ready for the day, the first day of conference. He had a presentation that he was getting his materials together for. Either we went to Macy F's room or she came to ours for some reason. We were chatting. We left to go to one of the main conference areas. We walked into the area where the exhibitors and products were to be set up. The room was full of many exhibitors, and only other exhibitors than what I had scheduled. I was dumbfounded, and angry. I stopped and spoke briefly with one of the exhibitors. I asked if they had rented a booth here and they said no, they were just paying a percent of sales. I asked what percentage they were paying and they said it depended on the item. Then I asked them whom they spoke to about being here and they said Loretta M. I immediately became furious. I began moving around the room and speaking with other exhibitors. They had all spoken to Loretta M, and they were all pay percentages of sales as opposed to booth rental. The amounts they were paying all varied. Ron L and a business partner had one of the booths. He had some type of expensive equipment they were showing and selling. He was being charged 45% commission. I approached Loretta M. I was so angry I could hardly speak, but trying to tell her that this was not her place to do this, and especially to do it without my knowledge. "
"1617"	"(2007-08-06)"	"I was at a theater downtown. Whatever I was there for, I was supposed to go back stage. At some point the theater, where the seats normally are, was an indoor athletics field. There indoor youth soccer games being held. I was looking through a window that had horizontal slats about every 6 inches. The slats kept me from having a good view. There were other people around. I told someone that I have always enjoyed the small children play soccer, especially the very young ones. By the time I was ready to leave, the group of high school senior girls had just finished their game. Someone said something to them about it being their last high school game. They were walking away from us but turned to their left, looked over their shoulders, nodded their heads yes, and smiled. There were four girls, all very tall, dressed in beige shirts and shorts. They were all wearing their hair in ponytails. Bev, Aunt H, Aunt P, and Mother were all there. I had been selling things online for various people. A man had given me a food processor to sell. It looked very similar to my old one. I had sold it but the person who bought it returned it, saying that the lid lock was broken. The owner had not told me this. I checked and it was broken. I was upset that I didn't know this prior to placing the ad. Since the owner hadn't told me, I also wondered if I was going to be able to get him to pay the customer back. He agreed to refund the clients money himself, and allowing me to keep my commission for my effort. There was a table with lots of things sitting on it. I was gathering some of the items and sitting them in a shallow box. These were items that I was going to take home to try to sell. Someone started to help me and I said I only wanted the things that were cobalt blue, because I knew they would do well. I was talking to someone about the food processor, saying that it was a shame that the lid lock was broken because it was otherwise a great machine. We were talking about all of the things it would do, while using it to chop something. We just held the lid on snugly using a hand. A priest was there and had overheard our conversation. He asked me what I was going to do with it now. I asked him if he would like it and he very eagerly said yes, so I gave it to him. "
"1618"	"(2000-08-06)"	"I had suggested to the parish council at my church that we have a chili dinner as a fund-raising event. Steve Wi was there and thought that was a great idea. We were having the dinner and it was going extremely well. We had invested about $1000 dollars in it and we had already counted $9000 in revenue. Steve Wi was very excited. As it got close to the end of the event, the members of the council got in line for chili. There were two different kinds. Both kinds had something in them that looked like small rolled tortillas. The tortillas had the chili meat inside them. Someone said that Sandra Bowers [waking life criminal. News program did a show about her story.] was at the dinner and everyone became very frightened. Someone called in a very large security force to try to find and capture her. The members of the security force were all armed. Quite a few people had been killed, but I'm not sure if they were accidentally killed by the security force or killed by Sandra. There was a line of caskets with people who had been killed. Security thought they had killed Sandra and her mother, and they were in two of the caskets. Their caskets weren't sitting side-by-side. The caskets were in a large room that resembled a warehouse. It was fairly dark inside. Sandra and her mother weren't really dead and got out of their caskets as soon as they thought no one was around. Even though they thought they were dead, the security force had not left and were still on full alert. Someone spotted Sandra's mother and shot her. This time she really did die. A little bit later, someone spotted Sandra and shot her. She fell to the ground and they thought they had really killed her that time. She managed to get up and move again. She looked like she hadn't been hurt at all. There was no blood or anything. I was very frightened, and some people thought she was after me. One man was trying to get me to a safe place. There were large pallets, filled with boxes and covered for storage. We were walking across the tops of these boxes. I saw her down below and was trying to hide so she wouldn't see me. There was a plastic bag that I thought I could cover myself with and I would just look like I was one of the dead bodies. I moved the bag and realized it was already covering a dead body. I decided that I would rather lay by a dead body and be safe than to take my chances. At the end it seemed that she had switched identities with someone else."

After he had finished his work he told me that I should not stand by the sink to brush my hair, because hair is what has caused the clog. He was telling me that I should always stand away from the sink so the loose hair would fall on the floor. I said, that way I can just vacuum the fallen hair. He said, yes. "
"1620"	"(2007-08-08)"	"I was in a dating contest, similar to The Bachelor, on TV, though I seem to have gotten involved unintentionally. I had no interest in participating and no interest in the bachelor, but was just playing along. The bachelor was Ben Affleck. When it got down to the final few women, they said the bachelor now had to choose two women for final one-on-one dates. His final choice would be one of those two women. Even though a number of the other women were interested in him, most of us agreed that there was one woman in particular who was the best fit for him. We all decided to talk with him at once and tell him that. He had not spent much time with the woman we had in mind because she is very quiet and reserved. We had asked him to come and meet us because we wanted to talk with him, though we hadn't told him why. We were all dressed in semi-formal attire, and sitting on the walls of a large, public fountain. It was early evening, and the sun was beginning to set. When he arrived, we told him why we wanted to talk with him. We strongly encouraged him to choose her for one of his final dates. He agreed to do so. Then he chose me for his other final date. I was very surprised, and I didn't really want the final date. I also didn't want to tell anyone that I hadn't wanted to participate in this contest and that I had just been playing along. Since most of us had agreed that the other girl was the best match for him, I decided to just go on the date because I thought there would be less chance of him choosing someone other than the one girl we had talked to him about. As we were driving to wherever it was that we were going for our date I asked him if he has dated older women in the past, knowing that he was significantly younger than I am. He said that he has, and that he enjoys older women. I saw that he isn't much older than my son. He asks how old my son is, and gets a surprised look on his face when I answer. He seems to suddenly realize that I am older than he originally thought. I'm pleased that he guessed me to be younger, but start guessing his age. I finally figure out that he is only 19. We are doing something that seems to turn into a water ride that you might see at an amusement or water park. We are huddled together as we are whisked through the water, barely missing being hit by large waves on either side of us. The waves stopped, though we were still moving very rapidly. The thing we were riding in had us facing backwards. We knew something big was coming, but we didn't know what. We decided they had us facing backwards so we couldn't see what was coming. Just then we were moved onto a track, similar to a roller coaster track. We saw it just as we were moved onto it. It was one giant hill down, and then several loops. I was terrified, but it was over so quickly that it turned out to not be a big deal. Now we are on a boat, and he is still talking about a relationship. I would not have a relationship with him even if I had any desire at all to do so. Something is happening outside of the boat and we see other people, maybe in another boat, off to our left, but a level or two lower than us. Two of the people are his parents. He has to do something and these people, especially his parents, are offering tips and encouragement. He is successful with whatever it is. His dad is very proud, his mother is smiling as if to say, of course he was successful."

I had such a great time I jokingly said that I thought I would move to their area so I could spend more evenings like this. They seemed to enjoy it as much as I did. Larry K told us that he had set Matthew up to spend the evening with a young lady, for the purpose of making out. He told Matthew to tell her up front what his intention was for the evening. I was standing behind him while he sat and worked at the computer. I saw him doing things that I didn't know how to do, in programs that I use all the time. I said that if I lived near them I could learn alot from him about computers. He was using alot of keyboard shortcuts that I wasn't aware of. There were four different kind of cakes. Matthew was there with the girl he had gone out with that evening, and one of her girlfriends was there. We were each eating one piece of each cake. We said we were doing a one night splurge. Matthew and I were getting ready to leave. We were driving a small-size pickup truck. We had bunch of things to put in the back to take home. We carried some things out to put in and pulled up a tarp to put the things under it. We both immediately noticed how dirty it was. I was hesitant to sit things down in there with it being so dirty. One of the things we were going to be carrying out to put in there was some laundry, though it was clean laundry. I suggested we take a few of the towels and lay them down and then we can sit everything else on the towels. Sue was sending some food home with us. There was fried chicken, French fries, and some of the cake that we were eating earlier. Alan K and Jean K showed up. Some of their children were at Larry K and Sue K's house. I jokingly said something about Alan K and Jean K's children were at Larry K and Sue K's house and vice versa. Jean told me that her and Alan had adopted a female child from another country. I don't know what country but the child was not Caucasian. The child kept morphing back and forth in age. Initially she wasn't even a toddler yet, then she was suddenly a pregnant teenager with significant nausea. Then she was a toddler. I am at the BE Retreat Center. There were quite a few people there for some type of class or program. Someone asked me about the SDI. There was a short flight of stairs, maybe just six or eight steps. I went up a few steps and then had to climb over a wrought-iron railing to get to wear the person was who asked me the question. A little ways in from the top of the steps there was a round coffee table piled with stuff. There was a magazine type basket with brochures and literature in it. People had piled stuff on top of it, maybe coats,  so you couldn't see it. A few people had made movements that led me to believe that they wanted to hear my answer also. I moved some of the things and grabbed a few of the brochures about the SDI. I handed a brochure to the woman who had asked about the SDI. Then I held the others out to offer some of the other people there. Three people actually moved close and sat down next to the first woman, to make sure they could hear well. I could tell that a few people were planning to listen from where they were and another one that didn't seem to have any interest at all. I started sharing my experience with the program and what a tremendous experience I thought it was. I gave them some of the technical information, like how often and when the class meets and other info like that. There was a couple sitting at a round table with a young child. They had another child that wasn't with them. They had been telling someone else there about an illness the other child had. Someone told them that condition could be much more serious than most people realize, even than most doctors realize. They gave an example of someone they knew. This person strongly recommended they take the child to see a specialist. Others had been listening to this conversation and someone recommended Doctor C. Someone else nodded their head yes. I'm not sure how, but someone knew that I used to work for SVH and asked me if I know Doctor C. I said that I do. The couple asked me where he practices and if he is part of SVH. I told them that he is part of SVH, and gave them his location. Then I also mentioned two of the young patients with this disease that he had cared for. I told them that he is considered one of the best and I certainly highly recommend him. The more this one person talked to them the more concerned they became about their child. I would even say this other person was really scaring them. They had become quite distraught. This couple decided to leave immediately. They were going to do something related to their sick child. Alan K and Jean K were going to go along with them and asked me to watch the toddler. They wanted to go see how they could help. Before they left someone said something about ice cream sounding really good. It was after dark, and most businesses were closed. Someone mentioned that there was something like an outdoor concession stand on the property and they thought they could get ice cream there. They stopped by the stand to see if they had ice cream before going to their car. They were asking the toddler what she wanted. I was putting the toddler to bed in one of the guest rooms. The bed was a little more than waist high to me. The bedding was yellow and white. I am walking through the second floor of the retreat center, and I'm carrying the toddler. It appears to be a very long building. There is no hallway. Each room is as wide as the building or as that wing of the building. The connecting wall of each two rooms didn't have doors but just a wide opening. I was walking to the room where I needed to exit the building to go to my car. Some of the rooms didn't have a front wall. There were very wide steps leading down to the sidewalk. I started toward the steps in one room and then realized that wasn't the right one, that I needed the very last one in the building. The person who was working in the concession stand was in a car and had an accident, hitting the man of the couple with the ill child. Alot of this seems to jump back and forth, as though the scenes of a movie had not been edited into the film in the right sequence. I was taking the toddler home to spend the night with me. I go through the same row of rooms more than once. No one can find the man who got hit since the accident happened. His wife is getting frantic. Alan K and Jean K get in their own vehicle and are going to try to find him.  "
"1624"	"(2007-08-14)"	"I had a temp assignment at ITI, in a department I've not worked in before. All of the desks in this department were in one big open room, set up in rows, with every two desks being set up to face each other. They were also not divided by cubicles. They placed me at a desk facing a woman that was my age or slightly older. She had very blonde hair and wore it the way my aunts were their hair, maybe causing her to give the impression that she is older than she might really be. There was a man at the desk behind her that was slightly older still, with silver-grey hair. He was a large man, not obese, but large. They were both friendly, greeted me, and asked me something. I laughed and told them that I am a permanent temp. I explained that I had been doing temp assignments there since November of last year, with seldom more than a week or two off in-between assignments. They just hadn't seen me there before, because of where their department was located. I was waiting for Jo R to bring me instructions for my assignment. [But Jo was not over this department in waking life.] There was no computer at my desk so I realized I would not be doing any computer work this time. I think she had finally brought me one thing to do and I had finished and was now sitting there waiting for her to bring me the next thing. It was nearly closing time. I got involved in something. When I looked at my watch it was nearly 7:30 p.m. I couldn't believe it. The other two people were still there. I said something about not realizing how late it had gotten and quickly cleaned up my desk and left. When I came in the next day, no one was there yet. I went to get the things I was working on and went back to my desk, after I started laying things out I realized that I was at the wrong desk. I needed to move over four rows. I quickly gathered up my things so I could get moved before anyone came in and saw me at the wrong desk. "
"1625"	"(2007-08-15)"	"I was working on an excel sheet. There were many rows of data. One row was a category column. I was going through, line-by-line, making sure the category was correct for each line. There were many errors. Some I had to really think about to figure out what the correct category would be. [This seemed to go on for a long time. I would partially wake up, go back to sleep, and continue the work. I know it was for a company, and it may have been ITI. But I sense that it was two distinctly separate dreams.]"
"1626"	"(2007-08-16)"	"Al H had reopened WDF and hired Tim W to help him run the company. I'm not sure why I went to the office. I leaned inside the door of a large room. There were quite a few people there. I turned to my left and saw Tim W. I was very pleased to see him and said, Tim! He was standing there talking to someone and looking down at something. When he heard his name he looked up and saw me. He nodded his head in response but didn't say anything. I was disappointed at the way he responded to me. [He was quite a bit shorter than in waking life. But he was over six feet tall in waking life, probably still close to six feet tall in the dream.] I took a few steps into the room. Al H walked in to my right. I turned and saw him and said hello. He seemed more glad to see me than Tim W did, which somewhat surprised me. I probably didn't greet him as warmly as he might have liked. I was involved in discussions about setting up the office and setting up processes and such for how things would be done this time. Marcia N also came back to work there, as did Polete U. [I had a great job interview the day of this dream.]"
"1627"	"(2007-08-17)"	"Matthew and I were attending an event at my birth home. It was being held in the basement. The left side of the basement, where the steps are, was completely under water. I didn't want to join the people on the other side of the basement. Daddy suggested I get out the boat. It was an inflatable, full-size boat. Towards the center of the boat was an area that was raised two or three feet higher than the rest of the boat. People could sit around the lower exterior or they could sit on this higher, interior part. It even had a motor. I was driving it in loops around this side of the basement. The basement was much, much longer than in waking life. It was a little bit wider, but not much. Other people got in the boat with me. There was something about BJ and a friend of hers or someone she knew, meals, and clothing. She had made a quick meal for this other person, putting two raw whole fish in soup broth. One of the fish looked like a baby lobster and the other just an average fish. I went to the bathroom and saw that this person had taken her meal to the bathroom and put it in the toilet, but she didn't flush the toilet, so I saw them in there. I decided not to say anything to her or BJ. Someone had put raw fish in the boat, which was causing a very bad smell. Several members of my extended family were going home with Matthew and I. We talked about taking the boat home. I was going to be driving and wasn't sure how I felt about that. We decided to take a truck, so most people had to ride in the back of the truck, including me. I was sitting towards the middle and talking to someone on a cell phone. We had the boat in the back of the truck with us. People were complaining about the fish smell. As soon as we got home people got out of the truck very quickly to escape the odor. Someone took the boat to clean it out and try to get rid of the smell. I think that was Chris H and Matthew. Matthew found a house for me to buy in my home city and he was going to live with me. The house was three stories tall, above ground. I believe it was a condo, one of two in a building. It was very large, open, with lots of windows and glass pane doors. Each floor had ramps, like handicap ramps, with rails or half-walls on both sides of them. The ramps were in the middle of the rooms though, where they seemed to serve no purpose. The layout of every floor was also very unusual, and hard to describe. They weren't all squares or rectangles, and the rooms on each side of the home weren't all the same depth as the other rooms on that side. The bathrooms were especially odd. They seemed to be big enough for little more than the toilet. The doors to the bathrooms were hinged on the left and opened out. As you opened the door, the toilet was right inside the door to the right, facing the same wall that the door was on. To use it, you had to swing it away from the wall, into the room, but it only came out far enough to be at a 45 degree angle to the door. It was attached fairly high on the wall, just below waist height, my waist. It was also very different in shape. The sit was black and dome-shaped with a two-inch oval opening in the middle front. This was clearly designed for women, but could only be used for urinating. I didn't see any toilet paper and wondered about that. In the corner of the front and right side wall, where the toilet was, there was a very small triangular space, kind of like a shelf. It was probably 2 inches or less in depth. This was our first night in the house, although we didn't have our furniture there yet. We did have all of our boxed things there, all still in boxes. We were all going to sleep on the floor in the same room that night. Bev morphed in age more than once in this dream, and she also appeared at the same time at different ages. Bev as a child was going to spend the night with us, as was Rachel as an infant. Bev the adult was going home. I told her I was concerned about being solely responsible for Rachel the infant. She said it would be fine. Rachel was sleeping. Bev gave me some instructions for caring for her. I was still very uneasy about it. Bev the child was both excited and anxious about staying there. The excitement was that she was always excited when she got to spend the night with me. The anxiety came from fear of the unknown, of a new situation, new surroundings. The previous owners had not turned in all of their keys at the closing. It turns out they had given quite a few people copies of the keys. As we were getting ready to go to sleep, a young man came busting in through a side door. Matthew jumped up and ran toward him. None of us knew who it was. Matthew said something to him, as he headed toward a closet. It turns out he used to live there and he was looking for some things he had left there. He grabbed some of the things that had been left in one closet and left. That had left us all a little shaken. Just as we were beginning to calm down, a car came driving into the main room through another of the glass doors. I was calling for Matthew as I ran to the car. I was standing on the passenger side at the front door, trying to hold it closed so they couldn't get out. I was holding Rachel while I was doing this. Before Matthew got there, someone jumped out of the car using one of the other doors and was holding a gun. He threatened me as he told me to let the guy out of the car. I stepped back and the other guy jumped out and ran to one of the closets. He was also looking for some things that had been left there. He went to more than one closet. He took some of the things and they left. We were obviously a little more shaken this time and finding it more difficult to calm down. Now two young women came in yet another door. They looked pretty shabby, and kind of scary. They had been told the house was empty and that they could come in here to use drugs without worrying about getting caught. I was beginning to think about how quickly we might be able to get all of the locks changed. They left and then yet another young man showed up. This one didn't just come in though. He knocked. We went to the door and he explained that he used to live there and wanted to get the rest of his things out of the closets. We walked with him to the closets. He was surprised when all of his things weren't there. We told him what had happened just before he arrived. He seemed a bit upset, more sad than angry. He was a very well-mannered, well-groomed. He said he was Catholic and had a decent conversation with us. I felt sorry for him, but knew there was nothing I could have done since I didn't even know anyone had left anything in the closets since we had not begun to unpack. "
"1628"	"(2007-08-23)"	"I was with three other people I knew [can't identify in waking] , driving downtown but I can't recall why. It seems we were having trouble finding the place that we were going. I told them that I remember there being a McDonald's nearby so if we can find that I can get us to the right building from there. Just as I finished saying that, I saw the McDonald's just a few blocks ahead and to my right. We were sitting in a booth at a restaurant having lunch. The place was packed. I was looking around and noticed Edward H sitting at a table with three other men. I asked the people I was with to excuse me for a minute as I got up and headed over to his table to say hello. He was sitting on the end nearest me to my left. They were chatting as I walked up. I placed my left hand on his right shoulder as I extended my right to shake his hand. He looked up and shook my hand as I said hello and said it was a pleasant surprise to see him there. He smiled and nodded his head yes but didn't say anything. I didn't know if he would recall having met me. I don't think he did, but didn't want to say that. Samuel K was there, sitting to Edward's left. Across the table from Samuel K was Morton K. Samuel K didn't say anything to me, which I thought was odd as he is the  one at that table that should have known who I was. Morton K extended his hand and said hello it was good to see me. He seemed to truly know me, which is odd since I have only spoken with him once, only as an introduction by someone else and then he had left. I shook his hand and said likewise. I don't know who the fourth person was. "
"1629"	"(2007-08-23)"	"I went into my old SFI store. I was quite surprised at how much it had changed. The type of clothing they were carrying had changed completely from African-American cultural clothing to typical American styles. The way they did displays had also changed. Most of the round racks were two tiers. They seemed to have upgraded everything about the store, though the prices were still lower than you would find at most women's clothing stores. I wondered if Lisa S was around. I was walking around the store looking at their inventory, thinking that I might be able to find a reasonably priced suit jacket that I like. There seemed to be two offices in the store, in two different locations. I was headed into the office to my right. It was a long narrow space. Just as I got to the doorway, I saw Randy M come from the office to my left which was set back further in the store. I was disappointed to see him there. I didn't want to see him again. He was holding something in front of his chest that was about the size and shape of a ruler. It had a yellow balloon attached to it and he was joking around about it to the employees. I went in to the office and said something to whoever was in there about Randy M being there. "
"1630"	"(2007-08-23)"	"I was working on a client database at the computer, though I don't know what company I was working for or who the client was. It seemed to be a word document that had many pages. It was an alphabetical list, or a list that was supposed to be alphabetical. The first thing in each entry looked more like part of an url than a company or individual name in color text. Following that was a brief description in black text. Something about the way the first part of each entry was in there was making it hard to find some of the listings with a search. I was trying to come up with way to make changes so we could quickly and effectively find the entries we wanted when we needed them. I would occasionally say something to someone else related to what I was doing."
"1631"	"(2007-08-24)"	"It felt as though I woke up, sat up in my bed, saw three tables sitting to my left, gave some thought to the things that were sitting on them, and then laid down and went back to sleep. This happened more than once. [I don't have three tables sitting to the left of my bed in waking life. I don't know if I woke up to any degree and can't say with any certainty if I sat up in bed or not.] Later, someone came in and talked to me. I was in a room on a cruise ship setting up displays for fifteen SAID stores. I had three, square tables sitting in a row along the wall. Each had just a few things sitting on them. Each table was a different store. I needed to determine the best layout in this room to set up the fifteen tables. "
"1632"	"(2007-08-24)"	"I was in my home city, I believe at the main branch of the library, with someone. [After waking, I can't identify who this was or even if I knew them in the dream.] We were discussing the beautiful architecture of the building itself and of the cement elements around it. There were cement walls on the property. Instead of just being flat and even on top, towards the end of the walls they sloped up, line patterns in the sloped part, and then a decorative cement element at the top of the slope. I was going to try to draw them as I'm outside waiting for Ben D.  We spent some time together, walking the grounds and talking. Near the building, there were things that I can best describe as iron, scrollwork gates, arched at the top and either brown, or rusted. They were just inches away from the side of the building, and were several stories tall. There is another piece of ironwork behind it and closer to the building. They were slightly offset from a window, so they covered about half, the right half, of a window. Ben D was the age he is in waking life but he was only 1 foot tall and standing on an arched piece of iron between the top of these two pieces. He was completely naked. He had gone out there to relax. When I saw him I became very distressed, worried that he was going to be hurt. We were at least two stories high and if he fell, I wasn't sure he would survive. I opened the window and asked him to please come him, telling him that he was making me very anxious. He asked me to take his hand and help him in. I held his hand as he walked closer to the window. He slipped once and really scared me, but made it back inside safely. I think it was just a day or two later that the same thing happened again. I am now at an event with a large crowd of people, most of whom I knew. Some were family, some were friends, and some were merely acquaintances. I was waiting for Ben D. He had said he would meet me there. I was walking with a man, I'm not sure if it was Ben D, and one or two other people. We were talking about the girls I went to grade school with. Diane S and Paulette W were mentioned then someone asked about Cindy S. I said that she was not part of whatever it was we were talking about. There was also something about Marlene F."
"1633"	"(2007-08-25)"	"I was doing something for SAID. I'm not sure where I was. There were other people I was working with but I don't know who they were. [I'm fairly sure that I knew them in the dream, but don't know if they were people who are familiar to me in waking life.] Occasionally I was in an office that reminds me of the BCC corporate office. Several times, I had to take paperwork to a specific department. After the second time, I remembered a different way to get to that department where I wouldn't have to walk by so many people, or so many of the same people. Once when I went the different way I saw Whitney P. Someone people had been talking about chocolate. She said something about having the good stuff, and pulled out the kind of box that we get from Arthur F. She broke a piece off the corner and began eating it. There was also something about transporting ourselves from one place to another, but not in any real way. It was more like something you see in a sci-fi movie or television program. It seems kind of like walking through walls, but we wouldn't end up in just the next room, but in a totally different place. If you did this in a sci-fi movie, you would end up in a different dimension or different planet, but this more like a faster way to get around here. "
"1634"	"(2007-08-26)"	"It was a Monday in late December or early January. Very cold and dark outside with either a heavy frost or light snow. Matthew and someone else was at my house. Matthew took my trash and recycling out without my asking, which he never does. After he closed the door behind him, I made a comment about this to the other person there. As they were getting ready to leave I told Matthew that was going to take down my Christmas decorations that evening. He chuckled and asked me if I was going to climb up onto the roof. I had forgotten that he had hung lights around the edge of the roof. I told him that I had forgotten about them and asked if he could come back tomorrow to take those down. I had really hoped to have all the decorations down that evening. He said he would come back tomorrow. As they were leaving I started pulling lights off of a bush by the door. They were still turned on, but as I started pulling them off of the bush they went off. I didn't look for the end and take them off in order the way we had put them on. Instead, I just grabbed the strand and started pulling. When they went off Matthew thought they were broken. I didn't think so. I told him that they probably just came unplugged when I pulled on them. This wasn't like my waking home. The front door faced the side yard rather than the street. The bush was to my left as I stood facing outside. It was taller than it was wide.    "
"1635"	"(2007-08-26)"	"I was working for SAID, working on several different projects at once."
"1636"	"(2007-08-27)"	"I was creating a member database for SAID using Excel. It had something to do with finances. I questioned the need for this since we already have a member database, yet had a feeling that it was important. I decided that I should tell Reid W. about the dream. [The line between waking and dreaming is blurred.] It felt like I was working on this for hours. I thought I would wake up feeling more tired rather than rested.  "
"1637"	"(2007-08-28)"	"I went to a meeting at church. When I walked into the room I was surprised to see Richard R there. He saw me and I said, I didn't know you were a member of this parish. He smiled slightly and looked away. He was standing facing one of the tables and had just laid down a notepad or some such. As he looked away he also turned his body away. This bothered me as it seemed like a chilly response. "
"1638"	"(2007-08-31)"	"I had another assignment at ITT and was walking around the building carrying a glass of milk. It didn't have much left in it so I didn't have to worry about spilling it. Jo was standing partially in her doorway, facing out, and leaning against the frame. She was talking to someone. I was going to stop and talk to her but since she was talking to someone else I just looked at her, nodded my head as a hello, and kept walking. I walked over to say hello to Sam and Holly. I reminded them that they wouldn't say goodbye the last time I was there because they both said I would just be back again the next week. I pointed out that it has been four weeks since I've had an assignment there. "
"1639"	"(2007-08-31)"	"Bill C bought a plane and called to invite me to go for a ride with him. It didn't look like any normal airplane. It was shaped more like a helicopter but it didn't have the blades on top like a helicopter. He was also taking Matthew, Bill F, and another guy named Woppler. [Don't know anyone by this name in waking life.] There was a compartment for us to put any personal belongings. It was accessed from the top of the plane and was fairly small. I was shoving to get my jacket in. Bill C said that he had told me there wasn't much room, and that the plane or compartment was really only designed for two people. We stopped at McDonald's for lunch. Bill C just landed the plane in the parking lot where the car spaces were. Bill C and I were at the counter getting ready to order. He was debating whether or not to order the fried water. He debated first, because it was full of sugar and fat. He decided to go ahead and get it. He gave me two sandwiches, knowing I would not want to eat all of that. He said I should eat half of each one and then give the other half to Kara C. Bill F and Matthew were off by themselves and Woppler was off by himself. I hate a little bit of one of the sandwiches and began eating the other. Kara C came in and sat down at a booth with me. She seems older than in waking life. I gave her the first sandwich. Bill C came up to me and said something about Woppler. I asked, do you mean Doctor Woppler? Though I knew that is who he was referring to. He gave me a bit of an aggravated look. He said Woppler had been drinking and was running around outside running around and acting crazy. Bill F and Matthew were out there trying to catch him. There was a lot of commotion about this. Bill C just wanted to catch him, get him in the plane, and leave. I suddenly realized that I hadn't been paying attention to what I was eating while all of this was going on and I had eaten all but one bite of the other sandwich. I quickly apologized to Kara C and offered to buy her another sandwich. She said she had actually had enough and didn't want anything else, but thanked me for offering. We went out to the plane and I was once again trying to stuff my belongings into the storage compartment. We are in a car, with Bill F driving. Woppler and Kara C are not in the car with us. Bill C and I are in the backseat, I am behind the driver. The landscape was beautiful, with lots of water. I asked the guys if they knew of any water sources like these in our home state. They all said no. I'm not sure what to call them. They seem to small to call a river, yet too large to call them a brook. The water was rolling down over hillsides and rocks, and just gorgeous. We had just pulled onto a bridge crossing a fairly wide body of water and we all saw to our right a huge, long wave coming right toward us. I hoped we could get by before it hit the bridge but we didn't. It engulfed the car and seemed to maintain this arch of flowing water over us. Bill F hit the gas and kept driving. I was so scared. I thought it would push the vehicle onto its side or completely off the bridge. Bill F managed to keep driving and get through it. We were all soaking wet, but Bill F and Matthew were covered with mud, head to toe. While still sitting in the driver seat Bill_F pulled his pants off. I thought this was so unlike him. "
"1640"	"(2007-09-01)"	"I was working on my websites and then on the website for SAID. I was going back and forth between documents or screens on the computer. I was working primarily on links for or on both sites. Someone said that I what I had done was similar to or representative of, or reminded them of, spiral theory. "
"1641"	"(2007-09-06)"	"I was working on a website, doing updates. There was a page that introduced the team of people involved in whatever the site was for. Or, I may have suggested that there needed to be such a page and I was creating it. I was going to list the people in alphabetical order by first name, along with a one paragraph bio. However, this meant that I would be first on the list and I wasn't sure that I wanted to be first on the list. As I was trying to think of the people who needed to be included, I recalled that one person was Abby T, so she would be listed ahead of me. When I realized that, I was disappointed that I wouldn't be first on the list. "

"1643"	"(2007-09-07)"	"I was vacuuming my dining room. I wasn't going to move the table and chairs, but just vacuuming around them. I stopped to work on my plants. My plant stand was against the same wall as the wardrobe. I was pulling the dead leaves off. Every shelf was full of plants. Some of the plants had large clumps of dead branches and leaves. It seemed that the more I pulled off the more I found. The table and chairs have been moved out of the dining room. I realized that I had let the plants go so long that there were weeds growing out of the carpet next to the baseboard. I was trying to pull them all out but having trouble with some of them. I had a garbage bag sitting against the opposite wall that was half-full. I started pulling all of the debris in that bag and filled it up. I got out another trash bag and started filling it. I realized I was going to have four bags of trash to take out to the dumpster.  "
"1644"	"(2007-09-09)"	"I was at a SAID conference. There was a large group of people outside around one of the sidewalks. Ben D was standing on the sidewalk facing and talking with another person standing on the sidewalk to his left. I was walking down this sidewalk and was going to need to walk right between them to get through. As I did, Ben D turned to see who was coming. I reached up with my right hand and rubbed the back of his head. He looked very rough, almost scary. He had tattoos covering most of his head and some on his arms as well. As I rubbed his head, I smiled, and just kept walking. I saw him again later, but just from a distance. I was thinking about how much I dislike tattoos and that it was disappointing to see that he had gotten them, especially so many and in such prominent places. There was a final program being held in an auditorium. The final conference gala would be held that evening. I left to go begin getting ready for the gala. I encountered Ben D once again on the sidewalk. This time he was with some other, considerably younger men, who looked just as rough as he did, if not more so. Because he was not in the middle of a conversation with someone else, I stopped to talk with him this time. He was being very unkind, even mean. He told me that all of this time that I thought we were friends he had just been using me, and now he wanted nothing further to do with me. I heard what he was saying, and saw his facial expression while he spoke. Still, something in his eyes led me to believe that he didn't really mean it, but was saying it because these other younger men with him wanted him to tell me that. These men were trying to control who Ben D's successor would be, for his work. They especially wanted to make sure that it wasn't a woman. I headed back to my room. Ben D and the other men followed me. My roommate had already packed and checked out. It was dark outside. I was very nervous about them following me. They wanted to come into my room. I told them no and that I had to pack and check out. I could see some of the staff on the floor above me. They said that I needed to pack and leave because it was past checkout time. The men that were with Ben D forced their way into my room and told me that I was to have sex with Ben D and then they also wanted me to have sex with another one of them, maybe more than one at a time. I was repulsed by the very suggestion. After that, they wanted me to have no further interaction with Ben D, ever. I didn't even want to be with Ben D at that point. Ben D was dressed in something that almost looked like some type of costume. It was scary in appearance. It was black, skin-tight, and covered nearly his entire body, except that his penis stuck out of it. I finally gave in and had very brief intercourse with him. There was nothing loving or caring about it. There was no kissing or cuddling, only intercourse. After just a few minutes, I stopped and told them all to leave. They did."
"1645"	"(2007-09-09)"	"I was at UI and had gone into E Hall to check on my classroom for an upcoming class I was going to be teaching. Another gentleman, about my age, came in for the same reason. We chatted briefly and continued to talk as we left the room because we were both headed in the same direction. He asked about my class. As I told him about my first experience with this class, I also said that I wasn't sure that the Midwest is ready for a class like this. Still, I was glad that the university had decided to give it another chance. I got lost making my way through the building, or disoriented. I stopped a woman in one of the hallways and asked for directions. As she answered me she pointed towards a glass door. As soon as she did, I turned to look and saw the parking lot. As I got to the parking lot, though, I doubted that this is where I had parked. I didn't see my car there. I finally thought I remembered where I had parked and walked around a corner of the building into another parking lot. I saw my car sitting in one of the angled parking spaced near the end of the row. When I walked up to the drivers side door, I saw a big clump of mud in the middle of the door. It was about six inches in diameter and close to an inch deep in the center. I knew a student had done this intentionally, even though they likely didn't know who owned the car. It still bothered me. I put some things in the trunk, came back around and opened the door. Now the mud was in the middle of the drivers seat. I was even more aggravated. It was still kind of wet, so I couldn't just brush it off. I reached in and began scooping it off the seat with my right hand. I did this several times, getting as much as I could. I knew I was just going to have to leave it go at that until I got home and could clean it fully."
"1646"	"(2007-09-12)"	"It seems as though I went back and forth between observing this dream and being in it. Though, I don't know what my role was when I was in it. This family lived in a large home with a big yard. They were getting ready to transplant a small tree or plant. They were somewhat concerned about how difficult it would be to dig a hole that would be big enough. When he started digging he broke through the ground into a large hole. In looking further into the hole they realized that most of their house had no ground foundation. It was sitting on a few inches of dirt. They were so angry that the builder had kept this from them. They realized that they were all in danger by living in this house that could collapse at any time. They confronted whoever was responsible for this. Now the house is on a beach. It is long and narrow, and very natural looking. It has wood floors, exposed wood on the walls and ceilings. It wasn't completely closed in. In fact, the outer walls were far and few between. Every so often there was also a wide set of steps leading down to the beach. There are five or six children in the family. They all become ill and are experiencing nausea. The parents are also ill. A male friend arrives to look after everyone. Something happened and I thought to myself that I remembered this from another dream even though it was not a dream I had recorded. There was a room with at least one wall that was all glass. There was hardly room to walk in the room because it was full of piles of boxes and storage containers that had some kind of paperwork in them. There was a desk in the middle of all of the piles. A man was standing outside talking to another man who was inside this room, sitting a the desk. The man outside was responsible for the boxes of papers, but he had not processed it the way he was supposed to. He took some kind of short cut to finish quickly, knowing that he hadn't done what he was supposed to but believing he wouldn't be caught. He did get caught."

"1649"	"(2007-09-16)"	"I was a child at summer camp, rooming with Susan J and one other girl I didn't know. The camp was very strict about us eating only healthy things while we were there. I had snuck in tons of candy in my suitcases, and tried to disguise the packaging in case anyone did see it. My roommates were glad I snuck it in. We each had a piece each evening. More than once, they suspected something and looked in my luggage. It wasn't until the last time that they found it and confiscated it. I hidden some of it someplace else, but later someone else came in and found it too. Some of it was gummy bears. Some of it was Easter peeps. There was more, but I don't know what it was. Some of it was in bottles that looked like Tums antacid. The first time they looked in my luggage and noticed it, I told them it was Tums. Susan J was sleeping in an upper bunk bed. I climbed up in bed with her and wanted to talk to her. I realized I was dreaming. I told her that I knew she was also aware that this was a dream, and I wanted to figure out why we were there. At first, she pretended that she didn't know what I was talking about. She finally gave in and said that she did realize it was a dream. We told our roommate that this was a dream. We talked about the fact that we had been there as children and that in waking life we are in our fifties. [In waking life, we never attended a summer camp.] She talked about her husband. Apparently, they were having problems. She was still wearing her wedding rings. They were bright gold and had lots of diamonds. I was lying on my left side as I listened to her talk. As she talked she began to cry, and soon was sobbing. She laid down, turned her back to me, and then moved back so she was up against me. I put my right arm around her to comfort her, but didn't speak. I was thinking that I was uncomfortable in this physical position with her, but wished I wasn't. We were going canoeing and they were giving us instructions, especially tips on things to do to prevent tipping the canoe over. They took us to an unknown location and the team in each canoe had to find their own way back to camp. Some teams did much better than others in figuring out how to get back. My team didn't. I somehow ended up in the water alone and was swimming towards another team, really struggling. I reached two other girls and told them that I barely know now to swim and that I don't even know how to tread water. I pointed out that I did not have a lifejacket on, which is unusual for me to do when I go canoeing. They didn't realize how serious I was. I was really struggling to get to their canoe. As soon as I thought I was within arm's reach of the canoe, I grabbed it and held on to it. Just as I did that, I heard them say something about people who grab for the canoe ahead of everyone else. When we were back at camp we had our wet shirts laid out somewhere to dry. Some of the staff were going around checking on us and asking about our shirts."
"1650"	"(2007-09-16)"	"Someone named Ed was going to die soon. I knew who he was, though didn't really know him. [Completely unknown in waking life.] He was terminally ill and the doctors were going to end his life in one hour. His wife and mother were very distraught, but making plans for a memorial and viewing service that afternoon, even though he was with them. He was a tall man with thick, black hair. They couldn't bear to take him to the doctor's office so I agreed to take him. I don't think he ever said anything. We got to the doctor's office and the waiting room was packed with people. I walked up to the nurse's station. They were four or five nurses working there. Two were standing and turned to me as I approached. I reached over the counter and handed them a suit jacket on a hanger and told them it was for Ed. They looked at each other and then back at me, as though they didn't know what I was talking about. I turned my head and looked behind me at Ed. He was standing alone in the back of the room. They looked in that direction and immediately knew. They took the jacket and called Ed to the back. I left. The funeral home was to bring the casket to the church shortly after for the viewing and memorial service. Several hours later, there was no sign of anyone. I went back to the doctors office to find out what was happening. The nurses told me that there had been a delay and that the funeral home would be able to pick up the body in about an hour. I was thinking that they would still need time to prepare the body before they can bring him to the church for the memorial. Someone else was with me now as I went back to the church. We were in the vestibule. As I reached to open the doors to the main worship area, I realized Ed was going to come in with me. I told him that he couldn't do that because of how it would affect people. I told him he had to wait back there. As I went into the worship area, I looked around at how many people were there. Many of them seemed to be celebrating. I immediately thought about stories I've heard or read where some cultures celebrate when someone crosses over to another realm and realized this must be what they were doing. They had set up tables of food near the altar and everyone was eating as they waited. Ed's wife and mother were standing near the tables of food, talking with some of their guests. As I approached them his mother walked away. I told his wife what was going on, though I didn't tell her that Ed was in the vestibule. She was visibly shaken. She told me to just get some food and walked away. I didn't recognize any of the food. It was all unusual shapes and sizes. I picked up something that looked kind of like a tortilla salad bowl, but it was thicker and soft like bread. I was looking at other people getting food to try to figure out what to do next. I realized that I had started at the wrong end of the table. I apologized and moved to the other end and followed the line. I figured out that the basic ingredients of most of the food was bread and eggs, and then I also saw some bacon. The plates had something already on them. It was a something dark and round, and this is what I was supposed to sit this bread thing on. Then you were supposed to put the other things in the bread. "
"1651"	"(2007-09-17)"	"I was in my bedroom and thought I heard someone come in the front door downstairs. I went to the top of the steps and looked down at the door and listened for a second. It sounded like someone was walking toward the patio door. I wondered if it was Matthew. As I walked down the stairs I noticed that the large box I had sitting next to the bottom of the steps was gone. When I saw that I realized it was someone else. I heard them go out the patio door so I hurried to follow them. I got to the patio door, opened it and leaned out just as they disappeared around the right corner of the building. I yelled out to them a couple of times. Two men came around the corner. One was tearing up a cardboard box. The other one said something to me. I went back inside and called 911. I told them I had been robbed and the men were still there. I was watching out my front window as I talked to them and saw them pull away. I told them they were leaving and that they were driving a red truck and pulling a short, low, green trailer. The trailer had sides and a back on it that were probably no more than 2 feet high. It had white lettering that something about trees. The police arrived before they could get away. I got down on the floor. I was thinking that this is the one time I might welcome Darren's guns. Just then, Darren comes walking in, and I see one of the robbers behind him with Darren's gun. He comes in and sits down in a chair in front of me. Both chairs are sitting along a side wall facing away from the front of the house. I hear gun shots and we both bend down. I tell him to get down on the floor, so we both lie down on the floor. A man comes in carrying a gun. He is middle-aged, mostly grey hair, short, and has a big belly. Just as I think this is a police officer and we are safe, he takes off running out through the patio door. I hear more shots fired. Once everything is quiet, we stand up and the two men that I thought were the robbers come walking towards the house telling us they are the police officers. I don't believe them so I tell them I want to see their badges. They each pull them out and hold them out for me to see, but they are too far away for me to tell if they are real or not, so I'm not sure if I should believe them or not. "
"1652"	"(2007-09-20)"	"I was attending a business program in a large office building. I was facing a bank of elevators, preparing to go up to the floor where the program was being held. There was a short line of people standing in front of the elevator doors to the far left. The adjoining wall was a wall of windows. It seems that there were at least six elevators. Towards the middle of the row, out a few feet, was a speaker's podium. There was an older man sitting on a high stool behind it. He was tall and thin, with gray hair. I was talking with him and said there is one quality that an individual needs to succeed, and that without it an individual won't succeed. I then asked him what he thinks that one quality is. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was right about this. He said something and I prodded him to take that one quality a bit deeper to come up with the answer I was looking for. After a few seconds I said, perseverance. He immediately said, ah, yes, and nodded his head in agreement. I then asked if he knew who the perfect example of this was, and without giving him a chance to answer, I said, Christopher Gardner. He looked at me as though he didn't know who this was. At just that moment Chris G came walking up to my left to get in the line of people waiting for an elevator. I turned slightly to my left so I could see both the man I had been talking with and Chris G and said to the man that this was his lucky day. As I raised my left hand toward Chris G, I told the man, this is Chris Gardner. I'm not sure why I didn't use his full name. Chris looked at me a little bewildered, not knowing who I was or why I am speaking of him to this man. I am outside walking in grass between two buildings. They don't really seem to be office buildings but I'm not sure they are industrial buildings either. I am dressed in a suit, with an overcoat laying over my left arm and carrying a portfolio. I saw the man I had been talking with earlier and decided to go back and say one more thing to him, related to my job search. As I approached him, he was sitting at a small, square, cafe-type table with an older woman. They appeared to be working as they both had papers in front of them. As I approached him, he looked up at me. I apologized for interrupting and told him I just wanted to ask if he had any openings for an executive. He said he did not, that they were a very small company. He also said that he still had the prior two executive portfolios that I had sent him over the years. I was quite surprised by that. It apparently showed on my face because he said something about taking note of me when he reviewed each of the portfolios. For this reason, he had not forgotten me. I thanked him, turned to my right, and walked away. Maybe ten yards or so in front of me, and to my right, was a lunch counter attached to a wall of windows. I decided to go sit at one of the stools and look over some papers I had with me. There is a feeling of being both outdoors and indoors, and I'm not sure how to explain that. A woman was sitting on the stool immediately to my right. There were just a few small, square, cafe tables behind me. There were some women sitting at one or more of those tables. All of these women work for the man I had been talking with. It sounded as though none of them were happy at their jobs, or with their work. I don't think it had anything to do with this man though. A server approached me from behind and asked if I wanted anything. I said no. She walked away to one of the tables behind me. As she did, I changed my mind. I turned to my left and back and said, excuse me. As she looked towards me, I told her I would like to have a cup of decaf coffee. She nodded her head yes. A few minutes later, she came back with a coffee cup and coffee pot and poured some coffee for me. As I got ready to leave I got out my money to pay for my coffee. It was just a dollar and some change. I got out a little extra for a tip. I was gathering my things and trying to hold them while also picking up my check and money to pay before leaving. I started to take the tip with me and realized that I should just leave the tip on the table. I put two dimes down next to the coffee cup. It seems as though I have a pair of winter gloves in my hand and that I have the check and the money lying on top of those.  "
"1653"	"(2007-09-20)"	"I was in BR. I seemed to be walking toward some of the shops, though I was weaving my way behind them. There wasn't much space, quite a few trees, and it wasn't a straight path. It almost seems as though I am surrounded by buildings, in a very small, oddly-shaped space. There were also a few mannequins in this space, making it difficult to get through at all. Another woman walks up and says something to me. I look at her, smile, respond, and continue making my way to the street in front of the shops. I am in a larger open area, with quite a few young trees. Michele is planning to hold a birthday party there and is talking to me about where to set things up. She points to the trunk of a tree that had been chopped down and said she could sit the cake there. To the left of the trunk there were some large roots protruding above the ground. She said the person she was having the party for could sit on those roots. I am in a small room with Matthew and Chris H. They were roommates and a third roommate had recently moved out. Chris H was not happy with his study space. He had a fairly large, U-shaped desk and credenza. When sitting in his chair facing the bottom of the U, his back was to a window. He also had just enough room to get behind the desk. I reminded them that they had set it up this way to make room for their third roommate. Now that he had left, there was room to reposition the furniture so it would be more comfortable.  I suggested they move the desk and credenza ninety degrees to the right. That way Chris H would have much more room to walk to sit at the desk and he could enjoy the sunlight from two positions. They agreed that was a good idea and decided to do that."
"1654"	"(2007-09-22)"	"There were a lot of people around that I knew. [Don't know them in waking life.] One man was considering suicide. A number of us were trying to keep an eye on him so he wouldn't, but we weren't successful. He jumped into an indoor swimming pool and drowned. We found his body floating on the surface of the pool. Someone told me that Matthew had also committed suicide. Of course, I was devastated. I knew I wouldn't survive this. I started denying it because I didn't see his body. When people would try to convince me I would just argue that they didn't know that for a fact because we didn't see his body. "
"1655"	"(2007-09-23)"	"I was at a meeting at a local school. They had passed around papers that discussed a proposal that someone was trying to get passed. We were supposed to read it and then sign off on it if we agreed or supported the proposal. I just skimmed it to get the general idea because it was so many pages. I didn't see anything that I felt was cause for concern so I signed it. Just as I did they passed another set of papers around, saying that there was an error in the first set. In the meantime, I was listening to some other people discuss the proposal and was now not sure that I wanted to sign. I was somewhat surprised to see Aaron S there. I was thinking that his daughter must be a teenage by now. It had been seven years since I've seen her. I was going to say something to him but then didn't.  "
"1656"	"(2007-09-23)"	"I was looking at a detailed map of the city. It had the last names of the people who lived on each street printed on it where their house would be on the street. I was looking for my name at the end of Lakeland Dr. I was going to be moving back into the house that I used to own there. Connie B was living in the house next door, just as she did in waking life when I sold that house. I was talking to her, I think by phone. She was telling me how much free time she has these days and how much she would like us to get back to having coffee together frequently. She told me to come over most any time. It was a Saturday morning. I was thinking about the conversation I had previously with Connie, and considering walking over to her house to see if she was busy. I debated if I should call first, though we never used to do that. "
"1657"	"(2007-09-25)"	"I was working for an organization, helping them to get their office organized. Someone asked me about a pile of files. I mentioned someone else that I felt they should ask about the files as I was unsure what to do with them. There was something unusual about them. These files were somehow connected to Gary S and there was something very bad about the information that was in them. I mean bad in illegal, unethical, or harmful to someone or more than one person. Gary S was angry with me when he learned that I had find out about the files. He suggested I live in his apartment and he was going to move out. With some doubt, I agreed to move in once he had left. He had left all the furnishings and many of his personal things. I was surprised that he had left his personal things. If he was already angry with me for learning about the files, surely he realized this gave me easy and private access to even more information. I think he had paid to have someone killed and was trying to make sure no one ever knew. "

"1662"	"(2007-10-06)"	"I am at what seems to be a SAID event, though there are people there from SAID and from CRHP. Ben D and I were having some very nice time together. It wasn't intimate or sexual, just being together around other people. It was very nice. I was going to dinner with Ben D and with Julie D from CRHP. Two other women from CRHP decided to join us. I was the last to arrive at the table. Ben D was sitting at the end of one side of a rectangular table and the other two women had taken seats to his left. Julie D had taken a seat across from him. I was disappointed that I couldn't sit next to him. Julie D knew about my relationship with him and looked at me, acknowledging my disappointment with her eyes. Later, when he and I were talking we decided that I would go to SC with him that night. There was a male college student that he was taking home to SC also. Ben D was driving a very small silver sports car. The college guy had several pieces of very large luggage. Ben D was having trouble fitting it in the trunk of his car, which opened by the back window instead of by the rear of the car. He knew he still had to make room for my luggage somewhere. Something was going to have go in the backseat with the college student. I was in the lobby of the CAS office building and saw Bill C. We both seemed genuinely happy to see each other and there was no tension at all. It was as though time had simply wiped it all away, though, nothing was mentioned about the past. I noticed that he had once again changed staff, now having one young woman and one young man working for him as consultants. I agreed to take care of something for him before I left. There was a very large machine in the lobby. It was nearly 5 feet tall and about 3 or 4 feet wide and deep. There was a square opening in the wall, about 2 or 3 feet on each side and bit deeper than that. It was lined with steel sheeting. There was a big pile of what appears to be cash register receipts and I am feeding them into this machine by month. Ben D comes in with his usual big smile, and I smile back. He is always smiling and seeing him always makes me smile. He is waiting for me to finish so we can go. I tell him I am almost done. I realize that it would take me too long to finish so I go tell Bill C that I'm not going to be able to do anymore. He seems to appreciate how much I did for him. As I am leaving, I see Jane C sitting at the end of a low, cream-colored, rectangular table. I lean over a bit to get her attention and see that she is talking on the phone. She notices me but doesn't respond in any way. I left and walked out to Ben D's car."

"1666"	"(2007-10-19)"	"I was shopping in II with Stacey London and Clinton  Kelly. It was getting late. I went to Castleview Mall and only had about thirty minutes before the stores were going to close. Then we went to KATC. We had not bought anything yet. We were going through the mall. It had a very unique layout. The stores were similar to the very selective, upper class, boutiques you might find in New York. There was only one of each thing in the stores. Very sparsely stocked. Clinton was playing some kind of game in the ball, shooting at things. He continued as we walked out the door. He was shooting at something on the wall. Stacey had left a white, beaded hat lying outside on a partial wall next to the car. She saw that it had blown off and was lying on the ground. The other side of the wall was a very steep embankment. She was going to let it go but then saw an opening in the wall and decided to run down and get it. I was surprised that she was able to remain upright given how steep the embankment was. I didn't think we would be able to buy anything since the stores had closed. They said they typically don't finish in one day when they are taking someone shopping. They were going to spend the night at my house. My house looked very different than in waking life. It was very large and very, very modern. Sparsely decorated and all white. While we were shopping, Stacey had been doing the driving. After we finished and were headed back to my house. Clinton was driving and Stacey was sitting in the front seat next to him. While we were shopping, at one point Clinton had offered me his arm while we walked. I don't know why. I think because I was becoming so tired. After that, if I wasn't holding on to his arm, he was holding my hand. We were rushing to one of the stores and I was lagging behind. I told him he was just going to have to pull me, so he did. It did help me to move faster. When we were headed back to the house, Stacey was sitting in the middle, right next to him, and was leaning against him. She laid her head on his shoulder and he tilted his head down on hers. I saw them kiss and was confused and bothered by this because earlier it felt that he had a romantic interest in me. So, I didn't understand this. Also, I remembered that they said in an interview once that there was only a friendship between them. But now that appears to not be true. When we got to the house, I told them they could have my bedroom. Lara D is with us now. I told her she could sleep in Matthew's room and I would sleep in the living room. My home was all one floor. We were all so dead tired. So they each headed to the bedrooms and straight to bed as I headed to the sofa. I went through a window in the wall or something like that, into Matthew's room where Layne was. I told her she could pull the futon out into a bed but she didn't know how. I told her that there seemed to be a trick to it. I pulled it out for her. My bathroom was huge. It was bigger than a very large public bathroom. There was a row of stalls, but the stalls were about twice the size of those typically seen in public bathrooms. There were no doors on them either. There was a wall that came about halfway across the front but was only about three feet tall. The side walls were floor to ceiling. Everything is white. There is no color at all in this bathroom, the walls, fixtures and everything. Everyone was using the bathroom at once. No one seemed concerned about anyone seeing them in a stall. I guess because of the partial wall. I was uncomfortable with it, but soon realized they all seemed oblivious to anything anyone else was doing. Cal B is there now. We were all so dead tired. Stacey was planning to get up at 4:30 in the morning. Clinton and Lara D were planning to get up at 5:00. I decided to get up at 4:45 so we could stagger our times in the shower. Even though we were so tired, we were having trouble going to sleep. Stacey was not sleeping in the same room as Clinton. They seemed confused when I suggested they share a bed. I apologized and said that I thought they were in a relationship and would want to be in the same room. They said they weren't in a relationship. [Things aren't what they seem?] Clinton suggested I share his bed, though neither of us had any sexual intentions or desires, even though I think we did kiss a couple of times. Lara D had some people coming there for a meeting for her business. She was concerned about things being quiet and about being interrupted while they were here. At the end of the row of stalls in the bathroom, there was an area much larger than the stalls, though it was very private. That is where she met with these people. Stacey was having trouble sleeping so she decided to go through my closets. Lara D joined her. My closet had two levels of hanger rods. I had to climb on a chair to actually reach the hangers on the top level. I went in and saw some of the things they were throwing away because they were throwing away some things that I really liked and didn't see why they would have a problem with them. In particular, they threw away two suits that fit me very well, that fit me best of any I own. I was particularly upset about this. They were talking about how atrocious they thought they were. I climbed on a chair and started taking the hangers from the higher rod and hanging them on the lower rod so they could go through those things. We are all concerned that Matthew might wake them when he gets home, if they actually do get to sleep. Lara D is concerned about him causing a problem with the people she is meeting with, especially because he had a very young Andrew S and Todd A with him. I think he might have had one of my other nephews with him as well but I can't recall now. They finally arrived and were being loud. I told him that the three of them needed to be very quiet and he needed to make sure that the younger two were quiet. At first, they were very quiet but soon someone started making noise and this upset someone. I think it might have been Lara D that got upset. In one of the larger stalls there was a platform. The floor of it was as high as my waist. Andrew was sleeping there. He had his head covered up so I didn't know right away who it was. I think I said something to him about needing to be very quiet but I also told Matthew to find a different place for him to sleep. When I'm in the bathroom this time, I walked around the wall opposite the stalls and am surprised to see there is another whole row of stalls. Along one wall of this area is shower stalls and opposite the shower stalls are closets without doors. The rods are unusually high to hang things. Beneath the rod, maybe 3 feet off the floor there is a shelf, that has a border across the front making it more of a bin than a shelf. There are boxes sitting in most of these. Some of them have clothes in them and some of the clothes are still in dry cleaner bags. There are a lot of duplicates and they appear to have belonged to a group of high school children. I didn't really understand why there were so many duplicates, like six or seven of the exact same garment. I combined some of the boxes because they didn't have much in them. Maybe I was just organizing them. I was talking to someone about how nice it was to have all of this extra space back there, to have all of these stalls and open closets."
"1667"	"(2007-10-20)"	"I had flown to MC to do some pre-event planning with Lara D. I was supposed to also meet Ben B. The three of us were sitting in a dining room and bar area. I was being very quiet, not saying much. Lara D noticed and asked if I was okay. I told her I was fine but was just extremely tired because I had not slept in twenty-four hours. She had suggested we do just one more thing and then call it a night. Lara D and Ben B went to do something and said they would be right back, but they were gone a long time. I was just about to go ahead and go to my room for the night when they came back."
"1668"	"(2007-10-21)"	"I was walking someplace and came to a stone or cement wall. I'm not sure if it was rock or cement, but it was light gray. I had to get to the top of this wall. A lady walked up from behind me and said she would help me up and got up the wall very quickly and then reached her hand up and pulled me up. I was afraid that would be too much for her but she had no problem pulling me up. [I had forgotten about this dream until today when I transcribed - it more than a month later. Interestingly, over the last few days I have been thinking about writing a letter to Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, about licensing my invention. I've been having just a bit of doubt about whether I should follow through with that, or if I do, what to put in the letter. Metaphorically, it could be said that Sara climbed an economic wall of success very quickly. She invented her first product 9 years ago, turned it into a business of her own from her apartment, and last year had revenues of $150 million.] At the top of the wall was a kind of trench. It was full of water. Now she is with a man that I think is Jesus. [I don't remember why I thought this.] They direct me to grab one of these inflatable rafts that are not yet inflated. When I laid it on the water it automatically inflated. I am walking downtown and it is just packed with people. There is an Easter parade. I'm kind of walking behind the parade because I know that is the easiest way for me to get through the crowd. There is something about ITI and someone that I worked with there or had met there. It was a man. He had hired Brian C to come back and teach. I was disappointed that this man had not called me to come and teach there. He apologized and said he just didn't think of me. He said he felt badly about that and he would absolutely remember and call me the next time he had an opening. I am out in the street and it is still packed with people. There is one section where there is a big circle with a stone wall that is about three feet high. There is so much color everywhere, and so many people, and so much noise. It's all very positive, not a bad or annoying thing. Around this circle there are four or five stations. At each station there is something I need to say, like answer a question. If I'm correct, they hand me a stone tablet, like you would see in Bible stories. Each tablet has one word carved into it. I've gotten three of them, all but one. When I approach the final station, the word on the tablet at the station is cherish. I don't know if I am supposed to explain why cherish is important or what it means or something else. I relate it to the other tablets that have words like love, hope, and faith on them. Maybe one of them had, [I don't know now. I waited two days to record this dream because there was so much to it and so much emotion. It did bring to mind how long it has been since I've been on retreat. I decided that I needed to spend yesterday in silent retreat and not do any of the things that I would normally do. Unfortunately, having the house totally quiet and trying to spend the time just praying, reading, and reflecting, I kept falling asleep. I ended up sleeping more than anything else. I can't even begin to explain the emotion attached to that dream. I don't know if I'm having trouble recording it because I waited so long. I think part of the reason that I waited was because I knew I would have trouble recording it, trouble putting the pieces together or recording it in any kind of accurate order.] I was flying and had some very colorful things in my hand. They were saturated, bright colors, not neon, and not jewel tones, but deep colors. There was some kind of pattern. It was like a flowing fabric. I was holding two corners, one with each hand. There was a pattern to it, though I don't know that it was just a pattern or some kind of dimension to it. I don't know how to explain it. Someone was observing me flying. As I moved these things around, they made a positive comment about me being able to do something very well, though I can't recall what that something was. Bill F and Daddy were both in the dream but I can't recall how."

I asked him if he was going to finally tell me what was going on and why he hadn't responded. He said he was. He told me why and I can't remember now. [This upsets me very much that I can't remember what he said. I would really like to know what has prevented him from responding when we used to be very close friends.] It was such a simple, little thing. It was based on a misunderstanding."

He told me that Gary  S was going to be in town in a few months. I mentioned to him that I was going to try to lose twenty pounds before then. He shook his head no, as if he didn't believe that I could. A couple of months later he and Gary S showed up and I had lost the weight. John B was shocked that I had been successful. Gary S was quite taken with how good I looked. I knew we were going to have some private time together later and I was so excited. I could hardly wait. The work that I was doing there was initially manual labor. I was using an electric sander to smooth the edges of sawhorses."

"1682"	"(2007-11-23)"	"I had decided to continue working for CAS part time, just whenever I could get over there to do some routine and organizational things for him, to help them stay organized. The office is still in the same building but looks very different than in waking life, though it looks the same as it has looked in other dreams. There is a long hallway with offices on both sides of the hallway. Brooke G is working there. I am thinking about how different she looks than her picture. In the dream, she is much shorter than in waking life and has thick, blonde hair, wearing it in a kind of Marilyn Monroe style. She is wearing a very fitted sweater and pencil skirt with stiletto heel shoes. She is also wearing bright red lipstick. Her makeup isn't heavy but it is very film-star looking. I am thinking how much more attractive she is than her photo on the web and that she should get an updated photo on the website. They have an empty office for me to work from when I am there, but they also use it for storage and just cram stuff in there anywhere and any way. I show up one day to work and can hardly get the door open because of all the stuff they have crammed in there on the floor and elsewhere. I end up finally making my way around to the other side of the desk, but I have to get down on the floor and move some things that is under there so I can even sit at the desk. Bill C is talking to me about some of this. I am trying to be calm and diplomatic in what I say, not letting my frustration be evident. I don't want to ruffle any feathers or cause any problems. DDSI has offices in the same suite across the hall. They asked me to come and talk with them about something, but didn't say what. I think I walked into the meeting with Joanne N. We were trying to figure out a time. Once or twice I leaned into their office to ask her if she had a time in mind yet. One time she responded that now was fine, but for some reason I didn't go in or go back right away. When I finally do go over it looks like they are moving in or moving out. Bobbie U is working at the receptionist desk of the suite, working for both CAS and DDSI."

"1684"	"(2007-11-26)"	"I was working at ITI. I went to make some copies. I lifted the lid of the copier and found a chemisette laying on it. I was very upset by this because it wasn't one of mine. It had three large holes at the bottom of it. I went to the copy room a second time and found another one. Neither of them looked nice at all. Someone there had heard about my chemisettes and decided to copy the idea and sell them to people working at ITI. I was very upset that someone was doing this, not just because they were copying my idea but because I didn't want anyone to think mine were anything like these, as bad as they looked and as poor as the quality was."
"1685"	"(2007-12-01)"	"I went to lunch somewhere and saw Holly U from ITI. She was just taking a seat at a rectangular table when she saw me and motioned for me to come over and eat with her and the people she was with. I walked over and before I sat down, I saw someone else from ITI that I knew well and walked over to say hello to that person. As I did, I wasn't thinking and began to sit down to the right of this person. I suddenly realized that I had walked away from Holly U. Fortunately there was one empty chair left at this table, on the end and to my right. I and the person across from me simultaneously asked Holly U to come and sit there, which she did. They begin talking about my chemisettes. I am now going back and forth between a number of tables, showing them to all of these different people from ITI. Quite a few of them want to buy them. I get frustrated with myself because I run out of style cards and out of samples to show people. Now I am at a table sitting across from Darren and Tony S. They are talking about something and I don't understand some of their comments. Tony S finally raises his left hand, palm away from me. As he tells me that he is now divorced I notice he is not wearing his wedding ring. Dorothy S left him. Darren left the table for a few minutes and Tony S and I had a very brief, indirect exchange, expressing a mutual interest in going on a date. He says that is against the code, meaning that it isn't right to go out with an ex of a good friend. I agree with him, yet I don't really want to honor such a code. Darren returns and Tony S and I are playing footsies under the table. [This dream reminds me of something Tony said to me many years ago. Not too long after Darren and I divorced, I attended a Halloween party at Tony's house. They had a psychic there to do readings for anyone who wanted one, so I sat with her for a reading. She told me I was going to meet a man with a first initial of L. After my reading, I was sharing with a group of people, including Tony, what she had said. Dorothy wasn't around. When I repeated what she had said about the man with the initial of L. People started saying men's names that begin with L. Tony said, ""Lucky.""]"

"1687"	"(2007-12-03)"	"I was conducting a silent auction for SPX. I had donated two pieces of furniture and three of the figures from my outdoor nativity scene. The auction was almost over and I realized none of my items had sold. I felt a bit bad about that, thinking that I should have found better things to donate. Later, as we were cleaning up after the auction, I saw that my two pieces of furniture were gone. Someone had bought them after all. Someone came up and asked me what had not sold and I pointed out the few items that were left, which included my three nativity figures. Someone who had been helping with the auction had collected all of the money and had it in a zippered vinyl bank bag. When I found her and asked for it, it appeared from the look on her face that she had not intended to give it to me. I took it, with the other things I had, and went to find an empty office within the parish offices where I could sit down and go over everything, and figure out what our total revenue was from the auction. I looked into several of the offices but wasn't sure which ones were okay for me to us. Judy A was in one of the offices where there were three desks. There were many boxes and other things sitting all over the place. She indicated one of the desks in that room that I could use, saying that someone was coming in to use the other one. She said who was coming in but I can't recall now. I went in and sat at the desk she indicated was free and began to go through the paperwork and payments.  "

A group of us were getting ready to go somewhere, I think out to lunch. We got in an elevator. Macy F was with us as was Wes S. I knew Wes S was planning on us being alone with me at some point during this event. I was imagining what that would be like, after so many years and now that we are both single. I was unsure what I even wanted from that time. I was in a hurry to take care of something before we left. In my rush, I left my handbag or a some kind of bag in the elevator.

The boxes were causing me some difficulty. I was trying to get them to look good while still making them function the way the website owner wanted them to. Occasionally, I would ask the owner to look at what I had done and they would try to tell me specifics as to how it wasn't quite what they wanted. Then I could use that to try to edit it further. "

"1702"	"(2007-12-26)"	"I was at ECHS. I walked out of the room to find a restroom. I was a bit uncomfortable about people seeing me there and wondering who I was or why I was there. I walked around one square in the building, making four left turns, and didn't find a ladies room. Then I tried another section of the school, also a square of hallways. After I had walked completely around that square I still had not seen a restroom and was getting frustrated. I thought it was odd that they had so few restrooms in the school. There was a large group of people standing at the end of the last hallway I had checked. I saw an entrance that looked like it might be the restroom. I was trying to see around this group of people. I finally saw a sign indicating it was the mens room. I figured if I went just a bit further I would probably find the ladies room, which I did. When I went inside it looked a bit like a locker room, though not totally. All of the stalls were along one wall, none had doors on them, and they were set up differently than I had ever seen before. It seemed that all of the ones that had a little privacy, by being against the back wall, were nasty looking and I didn't want to use them. Since there was no one else in there I decided to go ahead and use one in the front row, about halfway down the row. As soon as I decided to do this five or six other women came in. Most of them chose to use the ones next to the back wall. Someone decided to use one right behind me. This made me very uncomfortable. I left the ladies room and decided I should go to the front office and tell them that I was there, just to avoid any problems for them or me. There were three people, at least two of them women, standing behind the counter. One was directly in front of me, I just slightly to my right and the other at a distance to my left. I told them I thought I should let someone know I was there so people wouldn't be wondering about the stranger roaming the halls. I mentioned that I had hoped to see Ms. Thompson and Mr. Linville while I was there, but I knew Ms. Thompson was now in class and I wasn't sure where Mr. Linville was. I'm sure my disappointment was apparent by the look on my face. The two women turned around to ask someone else about Mr. Linville. They didn't think he worked in that building. They were getting ready to say something about Ms. Thompson. It seemed that I was going to be able to see her after all. Just then, she walked into the office behind me and they say her name. I turn around and smile broadly. I was very happy to see her. She was considerably taller than I was. I looked up to her as I held out my hand. I told her that she may not remember me but I was a student in her English and Literature classes 34 years ago. I told her my name and she genuinely seemed to remember me. I told her she had been one of my favorite teachers, one of only two that I still think of from time to time, so I had hoped to say hello while I was there. I told her I had just recently completed my Ph.D. I was getting ready to leave the school. Each of the entrances had two sets of doors. One set was set in slightly further than the other, creating a bit of a foyer. As I was entering the foyer of one set of doors, on my way out, I saw Mr. Linville nearly at the other set of doors, on his way in. I stepped into the foyer and waited for him. As he entered the foyer I told him he was just the person I had hoped to see. He looked at me quizzically. I offered my hand as I told him that I was a student of his 34 years ago, during the first two years after ECHS had been built. He smiled but was still baffled. I told him my name and he smiled broadly and nodded his head yes. As with Ms Thompson, he genuinely seemed to remember me. I told him the same thing that I told Ms Thompson, that he was one of two teachers that I still think of from time to time. I also told him that he is the teacher that I appreciate most from those school years. He wanted to know why. I told him that it was because he treated me differently than other people did, like he really believed in me. I said that I didn't know if he knew anything about my home life, or how my parents told me that I shouldn't expect to be as smart as my older brother and sister and they wouldn't let me take the high school college prep classes and told me I would never go to college. But I told him that he always made me feel that I  had just as much potential as they did, and he was always very kind to me. Those were the things that I always remember about him. He seemed touched and genuinely pleased to hear these things. When I told him that I had recently completed my PhD he was literally beaming. "

When they got up there was another family in there so they went back downstairs. When I saw them back downstairs I asked why and they said someone else was in my room. I pretended to have made a mistake and said I was sorry, that I meant they could sleep in my mom and dad's room. So they went up to that room and went to bed. I was playing with one of the twins prior to that. I see the two twins laying in my bed asleep. Instead of laying side-by-side they are laying head-to-toe. Charlie and Allen from the TV show Two and a Half Men. There was something about me helping Charlie. IT seems that he was sick and I was doing something to care for him. I was going to sleep next to him for this reason. Another woman offered. I thanked her but said I was going to do it. There was something about some of the people there engaging in some kind of sexual activity. There was a large platform with sides that came up maybe twelve inches. The platform was raised about four feet off of the floor. People were getting ready to lay in it, related to the sexual activity. Charlie told them wait a minute and he ran off. When he came back and he started dumping bags of sweets, mostly candy, in it. Everything somehow stayed neatly separated in twelve inch squares. He dumped large bags of sprinkles and colored sugar. I was thinking that was kind of odd, as it meant people would be covered with sprinkles and colored sugar. The rest of what he poured in was many different kinds of candy. Red licorice bits was one of the things. I was leaning on one of the sides talking with someone standing on the other side. We kept reaching in and trying different pieces of the candy. "

Bob F asked people to take one home with them. One of the ones that was left was one of my favorite desserts so I said I would take that one. We were having a conversation as we worked, about family health issues. I told Bob F that about three years ago my doctor had told me I was borderline diabetic, but I hadn't discussed it with him any further because I refuse to be diabetic. I decided to just make more changes toward living healthier. As I was saying this I realized that I shouldn't be taking that dessert home with me, and I could tell by the look on Bob F's face that he was thinking the same thing. I was feeling torn because I felt that I had been doing very well about living healthy, except for the holidays, and that it was okay to eat what I want occasionally."
