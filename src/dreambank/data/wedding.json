    "description": "This set consists of college women's dreams that involve weddings. Some were collected in the late 1940s and early 1950s in Cleveland, Ohio, by Calvin Hall. Others were collected by two different students at UC Santa Cruz in the first half of the 1990s.\n\nWedding dreams are of potential interest because of all the mishaps and unusual occurrences that are found in them. In terms of the categories employed in the Hall/Van de Castle coding system, these dreams contain many \"misfortunes\" of various types."
