"0001"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 11/??/47) I dreamed that I was at a public affair but I don't know which affair it was although it was outdoors. There were many people around us and they were of all ages. I was at this affair with B. He is about twenty-six years old and he is the boy-friend of one of the girls that lives in the dormitory that I do. Whenever I felt the urge to get away from my escort or from the people at the affair, I would start to fly. (like superman). While up in the air I felt very uneasy and worried about how I would get back down without hurting myself. I left my escort about three times in this way. I do not remember why I felt that I had to get away. Interpretation I do not know why I would dream of B. I do not know him very well and I do not feel very friendly toward him when I do see him. I believe that I associated him with my studies and felt that I had to get away for a short while. When I had this dream, I hadn't been home for about eight weeks and was looking forward to going home. I felt that I wanted a short vacation from my studies and this dream was an escape mechanism in the form of a fantasy to get away from my classes for a short while. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated. I felt that I had to get away. 3. actual participant 4. unpleasant 5. Vague, but it was outdoors. 6. No. 7. No."
"0002"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 09/??/47) I dreamed that I was in the office of the directress or nurses in the nursing school. She is about forty-five years old. She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.] Interpretation This dream is probably a form of wishful thinking. I would like to receive as many credits as possible for my student training. I did not know the results of the examination at the time of the dream. I had been thinking about the examination that day and I wanted to know about the results of the test. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated--I felt this way because I was in a turmoil because I didn't make more points in a test which meant something to me. 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. Office of directress of nurses. 6. No. 7. No."
"0003"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 08/??/47) I was in a room [The room is vague. It was probably my own room.] telling a friend [girl-friend about twenty-five years old] that I could get eagle stamps for 1/2 value of my purchase. I had previously read in a newspaper that you do not receive any value for eagle stamps if you have a charge account at this store. Interpretation I think that this dream was a form of wishful thinking. Since I save eagle stamps, I would like to receive full value for my purchases so that I can save more stamps. Answers to questions 2. Perplexed 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. Vague--possibly my own room 6. No. 7. No."
"0004"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 11/04/47) I was sitting in my room reading the newspaper that I get from my home-town. I noticed a picture of my girl friend, A. from home. A. is twenty-four-years-old. She is one of my closest friends. Her picture was in the society section. She was dressed in a bridal gown and veil. Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil. As I was reading the reviews of the wedding, I felt very unhappy because I hadn't been home to attend the wedding. I thought that the wedding was to take place a week later than it did. In the lower left hand corner of the page was another picture of A. and this picture was tinted. It was the same pose as the one above it. I couldn't understand why A. was wearing such an outfit. Neither could I understand why there were two pictures of A. in the paper. Interpretation I am looking forward to going home for the wedding of my girl-friend A. 's brother. He is going to be married November 15, 1947. I haven't been home for about six-weeks, so I am getting anxious to see my family and also A. and her family. I was thinking about the wedding the day that I had this dream. The dream itself is a bit confusing. I do not know why I dreamed that A.'s picture would be in the paper in two places on the same page. Perhaps the two pictures were just an emphasis of the fact that the wedding is associated with A. I know that she is going to be in the wedding party. Answers to questions 2. Confused--couldn't understand why the two pictures of A. in the paper. Unhappy--because I had missed the wedding. 3. Actual participant. I was reading the paper. 4. Unpleasant 5. My room. 6. No. 7. Tinted picture. Usual coloring that is found in a tinted photograph."
"0005"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 01/02/48) I dreamed that I had a date with one of the younger doctors (age approximately thirty three) on the staff at the hospital in my hometown. I was very happy when I met him at the door. He came in and we sat down and talked for a while. We discussed some of the patients that he had on the floor on which I was working & we decided to go dancing that evening. Then we started out to go dancing. Interpretation During my Xmas vacation I had been working at the hospital at home. I have known this doctor for a while and he is happily married. We are good friends. I think that I recognize in him certain qualities that I like in men. This was a form of wishful thinking. I would like to meet someone who has qualities similar to those of this man.

"0006"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 10/??/47) I dreamed that I was a guide at one of the parks here in C. I am not familiar with the park but I remember that I was directing people in the park to follow a sidewalk which would lead them to a voting booth. (Primary election this fall). There was a sign nearby that had bold red and white letters on it that said ""VOTE FOR NUESS..."" (or Neff...). I walked a little way with a lady about 50 yrs. of Age--no one that I knew--and then came back to my ""post."" There were a few other people of all ages in my dream but the lady I mentioned is the only distinct person that I remember. I didn't see the booth in the park but I felt as though there was one at the end of the walk. I remember that it way daytime and the sun was shining. Interpretation I do not know the candidate's name but he was running for mayor in the primaries this fall. (Here in C.) I had seen a man, the day of my dream, standing in front of a building, where voting was taking place, and he had a sign ""Vote for Nuess... (or Neff...). I can't imagine why I would be doing anything for the election. I never have had anything to do with elections at any time. I think it was a dream that I dreamed because of a visual sensation I had the day before my dream. Answers to questions 2. No particular feeling. 3. actual participant 4. neither 5. On a sidewalk in a park in C. 6. No. 7. Red & White Sign and green grass in the park."
"0007"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 10/??/47) I was in charge of a floor in our hospital in M. One of the nurses that was working on the floor was very untidy about the appearance of her hair. I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone. Interpretation I do not know why I dreamed this dream. The other nurse in my dream is not a nurse in ""real life"" but an X-Ray technician. I may have been conscious of my own hair being stringy the day before I had this dream. I did not think it unusual to be in charge of the floor at home because I had been in charge of the floor before I came here for p.g. work at W.R.U. Answers to questions 2. Angry. I was angry because the other girl was not careful of the appearance of her hair. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Floor in the hospital in my hometown (M___). 6. No. 7. (Only white)"
"0008"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 11/??/47) I dreamed that I went to take an examination and I was late for the class. There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination. Interpretation I had been reviewing for a chemistry examination the day that I had this dream. I reviewed all the material that I could and I still felt rather insecure about the material that I had studied. I believe that I felt that I wasn't very well prepared to take the examination. This dream was probably just a continuation of this feeling. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated, because I couldn't get my things together to take the test. Afraid, because I was late for the class. Unhappy, because I had a feeling that I failed. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Classroom. 6. No. Perhaps similar ones before taking an examination. 7. No colors."
"0009"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 11/??/47) I dreamed that I was trying to swim in a huge swimming pool that had no water. The fact that there wasn't any water in the pool did not hinder my activity. The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.) Interpretation I am not a good swimmer but I do go swimming now and then to try to improve my strokes, etc. I think that I associated the swimming with two of my classes that I am taking at the present time. The day before I had the dream, I felt that these two subjects were ""pulling me down"" and I was swamped with work in these two classes. Perhaps the pool without the water was a symbol for the lack of background in these two subjects which I felt so concerned about at the time of the dream. Answers to questions 2. frustrated, I didn't know how I would get back to the top of the pool. 3. actual participant 4. neither 5. swimming pool. 6. No. 7. No."
"0010"	"None"	"(Code 001, Age 24, 10/21/47) I dreamed that I was in one of my classes and we had just received the results of an examination we had taken about a week ago. I looked at my grade and it was marked ""90 - 30, grade 60"". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it."" I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age. Interpretation I was anxious to know the results of the test; I wanted to know the grade that I had made. I had to borrow a blue book before I could take the examination, because I had forgotten to bring a book to class. Before I had started to take the test, one of the girls asked me what time it was According to the M___ Code of honor, no talking should be done before, after, or during a test, while the girls are in the room taking a test. I thought that perhaps someone would think that we were discussing the test, and may have reported us. The above dream was a result of the anxiety that I had over the results of the test that I had taken about a week before the dream. Answers to questions 2. Happy, about the grade of 90. Frustrated about the grade of 60. 3. actual participant 4. unpleasant 5. Classroom. 6. No. 7. Yellow book for the test."
"0011"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 02/??/48) I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out. Interpretation This dream, in slightly varying form of detail, has recurred to me at increasingly lengthening intervals ever since I can remember. At times, especially when I was younger, it was my mother I was looking for, and I was terrified because I was lost and separated from her. At other times, we were together, and I was afraid of the escalator or the elevator. I can't think of any reason for these dreams unless it is an insecurity I have always felt in my home life. I'm not sure, but it may be that I have this dream after my parents have had a serious argument. Answers to questions 2. Terrified, anxious, frustrated, a hurried, almost hunted feeling 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Crowded department store 6. Yes--explained on front 7. No"
"0012"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 02/10/48) My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before. Next we were staying at the farmhouse which seemed to be a winter sports lodge. Somehow it fell to my lot to investigate some sort of crimes going on in the lodge. It was extremely dangerous and I felt as though I were constantly in peril. During the course of the investigation, my companion, (I think it was a girl about my own age who was supposed to be a friend of mine, but I can't identify her), and I discovered several human bodies lying on a wide ice-filled ledge jutting from a wall in the basement. I was surprised and a little repulsed at seeing my aged grandfather's body among those there. The arms and legs seem to have been cut off and were wrapped with the rest of the body in a great deal of grayish gauze with only the head protruding. My companion found a female relative of hers there, too, and expressed the same feelings I had. I was puzzled as to how they got my grandfather's body there, since he died and was buried last April. In the next scene I was in a bedroom searching for ""evidence"" but I don't know what. My companion was with me but I had the feeling she was either not on my side, or just not of any help to me. Just as I was coming out of the room, hurriedly to escape detection, the two occupants came back. They passed me coming out of their room as they went in, but paid no attention to me, as though it were quite natural for me to be there. I was greatly relieved. One of the men was a large, heavy Englishman, slightly more than middle age, and the other, whom I knew to be the brains of the outfit, was the Mickey Rooney type. Somehow, I knew that he was 18 years old. He was very handsome and attractively dressed in light clothes. In the next scene I discovered the secret. My companion and I were crouching outside the basement window, peering into a large room with rows of tables. Many men worked there, each at his own table, assembling parts of dismembered bodies, and applying make-up to them to prepare them for display. On each table were piled arms, legs, thumbs, and bodies in various degrees of dismemberment. I was at once fascinated and horrified at what I saw, but satisfied with the ""solution."" Interpretation I can't imagine anything more like a radio mystery story. Since these are my favorite radio diet, the dream may mean that I closely identify myself with the heroic radio detectives. I got great satisfaction out of my role in this dream. I was the ""big deal."" There were many people relying on me, it seemed. I was participating in the kind of excitement I never could find in real life, and when I awoke I felt very relaxed and pleased. Answers to questions 2. At various times in the dream I explained being:--excited, anxious, fascinated, surprised, repulsed, puzzled, relieved, horrified. 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Inside and outside a winter sports lodge 6. No, except one portion in the beginning which I explained as seeming to me to have been a part of other dreams I have had from time to time. 7. I was very conscious with the intense red of the farmer woman's cheeks. I never remember having been conscious of color in any dream before."
"0013"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 02/28/48) It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. ""Those aren't her books. They're mine!"" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble. The girls with me weren't very important in the dream. About this time, they dropped out of the action. I didn't want to get caught in the rally crowd, for some reason or other. I heard them coming up to the third floor so I thought I would hurry and get down the back way before they got upstairs. There were several stairways at intervals in the hall, and from where I stood, sort of in the middle, I could see them all. People were beginning to come up the stairway I had wanted to escape down. I ran to one of the others, and the same mob was already surging up there, too. It was the same with all the stairways, and by the time I had discovered this it was too late to get away at all, so with a resigned feeling of disgust I allowed myself to be swept along for a ways. It seemed to be a square hall, and we went all around it and then we were to go back downstairs again. As we reached the stairway, I noticed that just at the head of it there was a bathroom. I felt that this was my chance to escape so I ducked in there without anyone seeing me. There was a combination of a clothes chute, dumb waiter, and spiral stairway in the bathroom which I thought it would be a cinch to use for escape. It was up quite high from the floor and with some difficulty I managed to get my legs into it in preparation to descend. Then it seemed as though it was smaller in diameter than I had first thought it to be, and higher from the floor. I felt trapped. I couldn't get down through the tube, whatever it was, and I was stuck so that I couldn't get back down to the floor. I was getting worried and was trying to think of some way I could get down through that opening. Then all of a sudden I could get out quite easily, and I found, looking down, that from my position I could easily and safely jump to the floor. I was greatly relieved and I jumped down and all my problems seemed to have been solved. Interpretation My situation of being stuck and having several alternatives, not knowing what to do reminds me of the situation I was in the evening before I had the dream. I came home in quite a confused mood after being almost stranded in a strange neighborhood, trying to call a cab from a neighborhood bar and being stopped in my purpose by a local hoodlum, and finally a male and a female friend of mine showing up with a car and taking me home. I was quite upset when I went to bed, and I think this may account, in part for the dream. Answers to questions 2. I was surprised to find teachers offices there, a little frightened at Miss K--, disappointed & disgusted at being caught in the rally, frightened and frustrated in the chute, relieved when I got out safely. 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. M-- A-- building, the non-existent ""third floor,"" and a bathroom there. 6. I have dreamed being caught in similar predicaments, and some scenes in those halls I know have been present in other dreams, but the plot of the dream this time was new. 7. I was definitely conscious of an unusually large number of red sweaters and jackets on the students as I saw them surge to the top of the stairs."
"0014"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 03/01/48) I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. ""Does he really pull that?"" I asked, and they answered proudly, ""Oh, yes, all the time."" I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, ""Isn't that remarkable."" The blacksmith was very nice. He led me into the adjoining barn where there were larger white donkeys, saying, ''I'll tell you the story about why these white donkeys wear shoes."" The barn was sweet and pleasant, and the animals had very human expressions on their faces. I had a very comfortable feeling of being glad to be there hearing the story. I felt as though I had gone back to live in a fairy tale. The story started to be very interesting. It would have been a wonderful story, I am sure if I could have heard it. Just as it was begun, however, my mother was waking me up. I was very disappointed at having to awaken. Interpretation One of my friends who helps keep me supplied with dreams was telling me her dream about a tiny horse the day before I had this dream. It struck us both as very funny as she told it, and we laughed a good deal about it. This may have had something to do with why I dreamed about a miniature donkey. I can't think of any other explanation. Answers to questions 2. I felt sorry for the poor donkey having to pull such a big wagon, and very pleased and comfortable inside to be with such nice people and animals and hearing such a wonderful story. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. A blacksmith shop and the adjoining barn, or stable where donkeys were kept. 6. No 7. No"
"0015"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 03/01/48) Joe Louis was at my house. It seemed as though he was playing an engagement here as a trumpet player. He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, ""At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!"" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances. Interpretation My girl friend and I had previously been discussing race relations. She is taking a sociology course concerning the Negro, and we had considered gleefully the sensation we would create among some other of our friends if we should take to dating Negro men. When I was plotting in my dream, I was delighted with the prospect that I would be able to call my friend and tell her that I had been the first to date a Negro. Answers to questions 2. I was delighted with the prospect of going out with Joe, surprised at the emotion he showed concerning the girl, and frustrated when I realized that I really didn't have a chance. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. The living room of my home 6. No 7. No"
"0016"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 03/03/48) I was with my family and some friends in a car parked across the street from the little church I used to attend. We had been somewhere and were on the way home, but why we parked there, I don't know. The general atmosphere in the car seemed to be strictly inharmonious. I was out of sorts because I was the only one there without a date, and I sat slouched down in the corner of the front seat. My mother, father, older sister were there, together with several couples of my friends whom I am unable to identify. It seems there were some dishes down in our church basement which I had mentioned a dislike for at one time. I had mentioned this unthinkingly in a casual manner to a character with whom I had gone out several times. He is a couple of years older than I am and has a friend of the same age who acts as his stooge, humoring along his boorish tendencies, and laughing at his jokes: generally, stooging for him, although he's a little less ignorant. All of a sudden, I saw this fellow, together with his stooge and the latter's wife (he's not married really, and the man in the dream didn't look like him, but I knew it was he), come out of the church basement carrying piles of these dishes and laughing loudly and hysterically. They crossed the street and came over in front of our car. Then my ""friend"" started to put on his act. He would hold out a dish at arm's length and with a deliberate gesture, drop it on the ground and let it break. He had different ways of breaking them. Some he dropped in this fashion and others he crushed in his hands, still others he tossed in fancy ways before he let them break. I was utterly revolted that he could think up such a thoroughly stupid thing to do. I was completely disgusted, and tried to pretend that I didn't see him so that he would go away. I think the other people in the car were amused, and laughed every once in a while. He laughed hysterically as he performed, calling, ""Look -- look!"" I slouched down further in the corner of the seat, but I couldn't help smiling every once in a while. I don't know why because I certainly didn't think he was funny. Interpretation Although I have dated this man several times, I think he is an utter character. I spend my time avoiding him now. This act I dreamed of his putting on is just the sort of thing he would really do to attract my attention, or try to get my favor. I have a few facts that might in some way explain the dream. One, he is of a radically different religion from mine, and we don't see eye to eye at all on this score. This may have something to do with the setting of the dream near the church. One time when I was with him, I casually admired a lovely cigarette ease in a jewelry store window, and he went down and bought it the next day for me. This case reminds me of the casual mention of not liking the dishes prompting him to break them all to win my favor. Then, of course, there is Freud's interpretation of breaking dishes. I find it rather difficult to apply this to my dream, however. Answers to questions 2. I felt disgusted and revolted throughout the whole dream. 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. A car parked on the street across from a church 6. No 7. No"
"0017"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 03/27/48) I had some sort of report that it was very important for me to give to our family doctor, an elderly man whom, incidentally, I do not like. I looked out of the living room window and saw him driving slowly by in a car with two other people, a man and a woman. I ran out to him with several papers (my report--it seemed as though it was some sort of progress report on my own condition) in my hand and caught up with him a few doors down the street. I felt very kindly toward him, and very glad to see him, just the opposite as I should feel in real life. The man with him in the car was a man who lives in my neighborhood and whom I have seen many times, but whom I do not know by name. He is older than I am, but I do not think he is thirty yet. The woman was no one I knew, and she was not familiar to me in the dream. It seemed as though the man knew me very well, but I was quite surprised to find him so cordial and interested in me when I didn't even know his name. He sat very close to the old lady with him, and once said something affectionate to her and kissed her, at which she giggled. At first, I thought this most unusual that so young a man should be with an old woman, but no more I had thought that when I ""realized"" that it must be his mother. I was very satisfied with that explanation. Then the doctor started to drive the car in the opposite direction from where it had been facing, and about two doors down from my house on the other side, I saw several people coming out. First, was a girl whom I recognized as a girl I went to junior high school with, who had been a very good friend of mine. It didn't look like her, but I knew that it was she. Then a young man came out, following her to the car, and I thought he looked vaguely familiar, concluding that it was J--, the boy L-- had a crush on in Junior high school. I wondered whether she had finally been successful in winning him, and projecting forward in some way, asked someone later about it who told me that they were now married, after many troubles and separations. I felt very pleased about this, and remarked about it to my companions. I felt as though my faith had been restored in human nature. Interpretation Free associating, I can get a few ideas. The man in the car was blond, as was a man I had a date with Thurs. Having a reputation of a cynic, his liking me was a great surprise to me. Ages and birthdays came into our conversation, and I found I was 2 months older than he. That may explain the old woman and young man. I can also tie in the thought of finding something finally after trials and tribulations, as L-- did in the dream. In connection with the first thought, I might mention that I knew this date of mine previously, but had never dated him before. When I really talked to him, I found that he was a very different person from what I had assumed him to be after taking in all the things I had heard about his cold cynicism. The more I free-associate, the more I feel that this explanation has much to do with the dream. Answers to questions 2. Puzzled at friendliness of man. Surprised at his being with old woman. Pleased and happy at L--'s happiness. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. Car on the street in the vicinity of my house 6. No 7. No"
"0018"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 04/23/48) I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, ""I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager."" When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, ""It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things."" For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, ""Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them."" And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind. Answers to questions 2. The whole trend of events in the dream distressed me immensely. I was aware of a compulsive desire to get home, and was worried that I shouldn't get there on time. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. A street in what seemed to be a strange city or country, aboard a horse drawn conveyance. 6. No 7. No"
"0019"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 04/27/48) We were at a large gathering. It may have been lunch time at school, but it seemed to be more of a party. I guess just about all my girl friends were there. I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation, because I can't think of any possible connections between the dream and anything which happened on the previous day or any other time. It seemed so unimportant a dream that I suppose it had a very deep meaning. Answers to questions 2. A swift sweep of panic, triumph, feeling of superiority. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. A large gathering, possibly on the second floor of H-- Hall. 6. No 7. No"
"0020"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 05/01/48) I was at a party given by a club of boys who are good friends of mine. Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my ""steady"", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my ""ex"". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he (""Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, ""I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you."" Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, ""I came back because I still love you."" I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up. Interpretation This sounds like wish-fulfillment to me. I have thought so many times since I have met the club how much he would enjoy the people. At times I have thought, ""I'm having such a good time at this party (or picnic) but it needs only one thing to make it perfect--"". In my dream I got the one thing that made everything perfect.

"0021"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 05/06/48) My girl friend came over with a mutual friend of ours, a boy whom I have dated off and on for over a year and who I met through her. They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet ""the real John Doe"" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the ""real John Doe"" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this ""real John Doe"" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, ""THIS---is the Real John Doe!"" We said ""how-do-you-do?"" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, ""My, isn't he a nice boy!"" That was how he differed from the false John. Interpretation This sounds very much like an actual experience changed around so that the main person is different. My girlfriend had a boyfriend whom He both admired because he was so different from other ""angle boys"". He was so completely unemotional for five months while dating her that we had begun to believe he was that way naturally. Then one day our faith in human nature was shattered. We found he was just the opposite of what we had believed him to be. We expressed this fact by saying that we had now an acquaintance with ""the new -----. I had this dream right after our discovery, and it certainly all ties in. Answers to questions 2. I had rather a sly knowing feeling, almost completely unemotional, throughout the whole dream. It was a sort of tongue in cheek attitude. Mild amusement. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. We started out at my house where my 2 friends picked me up, proceeded by public conveyance to John's house, and ended up in his darkroom. 6. No 7. No"
"0022"	"None"	"(Code 002, Age 21, 05/13/48) I decided to get married so I did. That was just the way it happened, almost as though one minute I was single and the next married. Then I began to have qualms about what I had done so impetuously. I thought, ""But I don't even know this man. Here we are married, I'll have to live with him the rest of my life, and what if I find out he's not what I want in a mate?"" Then I thought, ""I can get a quick divorce because we were just married, and no one need ever know"". Then I decided nobly, ""No, you've done this thing and it's up to you to make a go of it. In a few years you'll get acquainted and you can learn to love him"". (Reminds me of the things I have read repeatedly in the lovelorn columns of the newspapers. That's usually the kind of advice they dole out.) Then the man came into the picture. He wasn't bad looking and seemed to be a nice enough person, although he doesn't remind me of anyone. I don't know how I happened to choose him to marry. He seemed almost to not even be aware of our marriage, and to care less. He took the attitude, ""Well, we're married, and I suppose we'll have to stay that way--this is your show, so you call it. What do we do now?"" That was beginning to worry me, too. I thought what will people say when they find out about this? They will expect us to act married, and I can't act married with this man I don't even know. I remember in the beginning of the dream noticing that I had on a cheap engagement ring. It was silver. I thought people might think it was platinum, but anyhow I was glad he had been nice enough to get a sterling silver one. It had been nice on his part since, of course, since he didn't particularly care for me he had not morally been obligated to do anything like that for me. Now the ring had become a plain wedding ring. I remember that we had a conversation concerning our situation. He smirked good-naturedly in an I-don't-care way, and let me know that if I wanted to act married, he'd go along with it, and if I didn't he didn't care either. I practiced calling him affectionate names like ""honey"", but I felt very foolish and uncomfortable doing it. He treated me in the same affectionate way. I was full of remorse for having been so eager, but I thought, well he's a good guy, maybe we can work it out. Interpretation Could be I have been thinking too much lately about getting married, and thinking about it in an entirely objective way, weighing this one against that one. After thinking such cold and calculating thoughts without a qualm, this dream may have come as a manifestation of my inner anxiety over such a course of action. Answers to questions 2.

"0023"	"None"	"(Code 007, Age 19, 02/14/48) In my dream, I first saw a group of girls standing in front of a school building. One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls, who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a sewing basket and removed a cloth, with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors, and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him. Interpretation The first part of my dream probably is due to my constant thinking about school, especially now after have attended so many teas this last week, at which so many girls were present. I was recently speaking with the mother of the girlfriend I recognized in the dream. The little baby was probably my little nephew, who lives with us. I imagine it is the awareness of his mischievousness that led me to dream of him and his actions with the scissors. Answers to questions 2. Surprise at seeing my girlfriend. Anxiousness--when I saw the baby with the scissors and went to take them away from him. 3. I felt I was an actual participant. 4. The dream was, on the whole, pleasant. 5.

"0024"	"None"	"(Code 007, Age 20, 02/23/48) I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family. Interpretation I think this dream is a product of my thinking about my grandfather's death and funeral. Many of the people around me were older people, all of my grandfather's relatives. I imagine I was surprised at seeing some of them, because at the funeral there were many relatives from out of town that I hadn't seen for many years. Answers to questions 2.

We were talking happily, next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher, whom I can't recall, was lining all the girls, (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then, finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side, were a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked with a few, and then we left. Interpretation I cannot interpret much meaning to this dream. I am taking chemistry at the present, and might be conscious of my sister-in-law, because she is a nurse and I am making my application now to send to a training hospital. I can't imagine how the tonsils fit into the dream, although it is true that mine are out. Answers to questions 2.

To the left of me by the water was a public beach & many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house, where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting with me.

Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter, 35 yrs., came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms, whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure.

"0045"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 01/26/48) I found myself walking to a class with one of my former professors, a man in his late thirties or early forties. He was explaining that his class was being held in a large auditorium and that he was having some trouble with snakes in the room. We reached the building and I stood in the background while he opened the side door to see if the snakes were still there. At first nothing happened, but gradually snakes began appearing in increasing size and number. The next thing I remember, I was jumping from one table to another trying to escape snakes of all sizes, a good many of them very large. They were coming very close but apparently never reached me as I awakened with no particular feeling of anxiety. The only question left in my mind was how I got away. Interpretation The stimulation for dreaming of snakes may have come from a discussion the afternoon prior to the dream, in a C-- P--class. We were talking about establishing fear responses toward rats and. snakes. I have had a terrible fear of snakes ever since I read Ripling's story of the Cobra, prior to entering Junior High. I also listened to a friend describe South American snakes (last fall) and had all kinds of horrible visions of Boa Constrictors attacking travelers, etc. This is the only logical interpretation of this dream that I know of. Answers to questions 2. Afraid, excited, and very worried as to how I would escape. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Part of the campus of the C-- of W-- 6. No 7. No"
"0046"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 02/09/48) I was taking a F-- D--- exam when I happened to notice one of the boys in the class cheating. I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him. Knowing that a new rule had just been established that all cheaters were to be reported and that they would be suspended if proved guilty, I determined to turn the boy in. (I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications. Interpretation The stimulus for this dream no doubt arose from an article I read that evening concerning scholastic cheating and the method of dealing with it which has been recommended, namely the honor system and ensuing reports, on all offenders. As I said the boy in question is a constant cheater and it irks me to think that he not only cheats but is going into the ministry on that basis. I dislike him and often wish he would be caught. I didn't turn in the report because I don't feel that that is the method of cure, and also because I never want to be known as a squealer. Answers to questions 2. Glad for revenge at first, then passive when I changed my mind, then frustrated as to the end. 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. Class room, dormitory, and smoker at W--. 6. No 7. No"
"0047"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 02/14/48) When the dream began I was busy packing my clothes in the car to come home from College. I was solving the problem by carrying the whole dresser into the back seat of the car and then putting in the drawers which were packed with all my things. Later I went off to class, my last one in that school. It was on a second floor of what appeared to be a gym. One wall had large windows in it which were covered by newspapers. A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself. Class was soon over and several of my very close friends and I went downstairs to have a cigarette and discuss the events to follow. It seemed that we were electing a queen for some affair and no one knew who it was. Several minutes later we ran up to the gym for the procession was to start. Elaine, a friend of mine and I were standing in good view of everything, right at the end of the aisle for the procession. The trumpets blew and I stood there eager]y trying to see who was the queen when a chorus of voices shouted my name. I was to have the honor because I was leaving for another school and they were showing me in this way what they thought of me. My surprise was immeasurable to say the least and I almost cried. The dream ended with Elaine walking me down the aisle to lead the procession. Interpretation Much of the material for my dreams of late has centered about the fact that I just left W. It's a time like that when you find out what people think of you, especially those who you consider your friends. I found out, when I was given a party just before leaving and it was very gratifying, to say the least. As far as the queen was concerned, we have been discussing that kind of thing as my sister has been up for a dance queen several times of late. Why I would identify myself with that kind of thing I don't know, except that I feel it would be quite an honor and would love it. Answers to questions 2. Interested in the proceedings at the window, excited to find out who was queen, embarrassed when I did. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. A strange building housing a gym and class rooms 6. No 7. Vaguely remember that there were colors in the gym when the procession started in, but not sure."
"0048"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 02/28/48) I dreamed that I was watching a group of boys in a large gym preparing for some game. In the center stood a boy whom I date quite a bit. I tried to wave at him but couldn't get his attention. From there the scene moved to a pool where a game was in progress. The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet. I remember some feeling of embarrassment for having gone into an empty pool. As I was climbing out I started fussing with an ice cream push cart which had several bowls of sauces at one end. Somehow I upset the whole thing and several of us hurried out with it before the gym teacher came and found the mess. We took the cart outside once and tried to fix things up. The rest of the dream is quite hazy. Interpretation I don't find any reason for this dream. I like to swim quite a bit and make a habit of diving in and coming right out again. And I have often wondered what would happen if you did dive into an empty pool. As for the rest of it, I just have no idea how to explain it. Answers to questions 2. Gay and enjoyable. 3. I looked on until I began swimming too. 4. pleasant 5. Gym, swimming pool (indoor), and the outside of a dormitory building. 6. No 7. Yes. I distinctly remember the bottom of the pool, when it was empty, was a rich shade of green."
"0049"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 03/12/48) I dreamed I was in N__ Y__ with my family. We were out at a big building which someone said was M-- S-- G--. It was dark green with the sides open and extended for miles. We stood beside it for a while and then got on the subway to go back to the center of town. The subway was run on the same principle as a roller coaster. We went on a level for a while and then zoomed up an incline. Every time we stopped I was tilted to the side. Finally we got off the ""subway"" and stood looking at a large wall map of C-- painted as a mural and put on a cement wall. From there the dream is a blur. I remember my Mother sat in the seat beside me, however, on this ""subway"", and my Father was in front. Interpretation I have never been to M-- S-- G-- so don't know what it does look like. It was built on somewhat the same principle as the C-- amphitheater. Don't know what the dreams mean. Answers to questions 2. Just rather puzzled because of the way the subway ran. It was fun and I enjoyed it. 3. Actual participant 4. pleasant 5. N-- Y-- C-- 6. No 7. Yes, the structure which I was told was the G__ was green."
"0050"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, ??/??/48) I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point. Interpretation Much of this dream had faded. The great number of numbers appearing is interesting, but I cannot distinguish why. As a matter of fact, the whole symbolism of the dream is obscure to me. Answers to questions 2. No definite feelings. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. ? 6. No 7. I believe the English teachers were dressed in colored dresses, one a rust colored red one."
"0051"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 04/08/48) I can't remember enough of the first part of the dream to record how I got there, but I found my self walking down a hallway, dimly lit, trying to get out of a saw mill I think it was. I tried first one door and then another that led off from the hall and each time I looked out to find a long drop to the earth below, thirty feet or so. Finally I returned to one door and then decided to descend by way of an unloading machine parked there. It had a series of wheels at one end, covered by huge rubber tires in groups of three's. By jumping from one set to another I was able to get down. Several men stood and watched my progress, I thanked them for letting me use the machine and then walked into a valley where I entered a hotel verandah. Here I found several friends (girls) of mine who asked me to stay a while, but not having been home for a while, I refused. I then found my self emerging on C-- H-- and started walking up F-- B-- to go home. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. Scared I wouldn't get out of the mill but on the whole I remember little feeling. 3. Actual participant 4. pleasant 5. ? 6. No 7. I remember the mud was very brown when I descended the wheels, and the whole dream seemed to be in natural colors."
"0052"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 04/24/48) I dreamed there were hundreds of airplanes flying over our house, which was transferred into a new setting. I stood over a broad field to watch the planes. They were a very peculiar shape which I can't describe but can draw--. I guess I can't even do that but can still see them there in my minds eye. They were yellow and, black and flew en masse in a seemingly unending supply. I remember vaguely that a man jumped out of one of them and parachuted down to earth. I approached him when he landed. He stuck his foot through the silk and tore the chute badly. I think I contemplated that the material would have been nice for a nightgown or slip. Interpretation I think the shape of the planes was somewhat influenced by some pictures I saw very recently in Life of the new Navy or Army plane with the peculiar shape. I can't account for the dream however, aside from this. Answers to questions 2. Excited 3. Onlooker 4. pleasant 5. Field 6. Yes. Not exactly the same, but I have often dreamed of airplanes flying in heavy formation with people jumping out. 7. Yellow and black planes."
"0053"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 04/24/48) I was lying on my stomach, dressed in blue jeans and a shirt in the hallway leading to the kitchen. The phone is in the hallway and I was with two others, a boy and another girl. The boy was on the phone and was blocking the way to the lavatory. I had an intense urge to defecate but felt considerable embarrassment in going into the bathroom at this time. Consequently, I held down my urge as long as possible, and then went into my pants. It was hard enough to remain intact and when I got up I went upstairs to dispose of it in the bathroom up there. The bathtub was full of water which somebody had left after bathing. 1 wanted to take a bath but felt that I needed clean water. The rest of the dream fades at this point. Somehow I took my bath and I believe I changed the water. Interpretation The defecation referred to is totally undisguised, obviously. I have found that just prior to my menstrual period I have a dream which is undisguised in a similar manner, although never before of defecation. Freud claims that dreaming of clothes means nakedness. This could be a possibility in this case because of the circumstances involved. The bath water is no doubt a leftover from two nights before when a friend of mine spent the night. We both wanted baths and while she was taking hers I considered the possibility of using her water in case the hot water was all gone. I did not do this however, as I would rather take a cold bath and feel cleaner. Answers to questions 2. Consternation over the defecation. Irritated at finding dirty bath water. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Hallway, upstairs bathroom. 6. No 7. No"
"0054"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, ??/??/48) I dreamed I was back in W-- but the college was on the M-- campus. I drove up in front of a barber shop where the sidewalk curb had painted ""student parking."" I parked there and went into the barber shop. I almost walked into a stag room on my way past the door. Then I walked through a passage way and ended in a large stadium. I was with some girl of my own age (don't remember who) and we went up to the top of a flight of stairs and looked out over a vast stadium in which the M-- D-- festival was being enacted. This festival (in W--) is written by a student and is usually a take-off on some characters like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Mother Goose."" There were many people dancing and running through their exercises. When we left there I took my little sister to the school bathroom. This was in Junior High School. I remember this because I had taken her to the boys bathroom. I can't remember what we did from there but we neither of us seemed too excited. Interpretation Just before I went to sleep I was thinking about the M-- D-- F-- and just what I could think up to write one myself. This I believe to be the basis for that part of the dream. As for the bathroom, we had discussed my father's mistake in going into the ladies' restroom one time when out of town that evening. This may be the foundation for that part of the dream. Answers to questions 2. Indifferently interested. 3. Actual participant and onlooker when I got to the stadium. 4. Pleasant 5. S-- Ave., stadium, Jr. High School lavatory. 6. No 7. Yes.

"0055"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 05/22/48) I don't remember how I got where I was, but I was standing beside a lake wearing my sister's best black print dress. I wanted to get across to the other side of the lake and was marooned on an island of some kind. In order to get where my friends were it became necessary to swim across. The first part of the water I went into was thick with slime and muck. As I got toward the middle though the water was clearer and rinsed me clean. I was worried about ruining the dress, but when I came out of the water it seemed to be all right and somehow didn't stick to me. Interpretation The dirty lake was inspired by my thoughts of a similar nature about the pond where the canoe tilts were held. The dress is one I have worn on occasion and my sister had it on the day before the dream. The night I dreamed this, I had seen a movie short on a fisherman who was pulled under water and went walking about the lake floor seeing other people. I noticed that none of their clothes stuck to them, and remarked about it. Answers to questions 2. Perplexed, worried, relieved. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Lake 6. No 7. The lake was brown, especially in the dirty part. The rest looked the same color as a lake usually does on a cloudy day. The dress too was colored, black with pink print."
"0056"	"None"	"(Code 009, Age 20, 05/26/48) I dreamed I was going out to dinner and went with some of my college friends, girls. We ended up at a restaurant on the outskirts of some town. It had a brown stucco front and several archways going all across the front. Over each was the name of the seven dwarfs and Snow White. Then there were three more door ways, or arches with names over them, but I can't remember which ones they were. We went in and ordered steaks but L-- was the only one that could have one, the rest were all gone. The rest of this part of the dream is a bit vague. Shortly after, I returned to this same restaurant with the boy I used to go with. I went out to the kitchen this time and took a steak out of the icebox to cook it myself. After this the dream fades again, but every time I dream of this boy I get great feelings of antagonism toward him and have awful urges to hit him. Interpretation Snow White, etc., no doubt came from the pageant I saw this month for W-- M-- D--. The rest I can't seem to decipher. It was very dim and confused. Answers to questions 2.

"0057"	"None"	"(Code 010, Age 21, 09/26/47) My husband (age 20) and I were walking down an unpopulated country road when we came upon a modern looking house. The house was all dark blue, and it seemed to be made of some smooth canvas--like material stretched tightly on a frame. We went inside and sat down on a davenport. The floor and walls were all in different colored squares which soon made me very dizzy. I faintly remember the names F-- and M-- as being associated with that house. Interpretation I have no interpretation except that I had seen a movie that evening with a Dr. Fay in it who was a man about 60 years old. M-- might have been a 23 year old girl I met this summer.

My mother and father were there too, sitting nearer the lake than we were. We left for a few minutes and when we got back there was nothing left of the football field, the football team, or the spectators. I was scared to death and finally saw a boy riding on a bicycle. I asked him what had happened and he said that a wave had washed everything away. I felt so badly because my mother and father were among the lost. Interpretation My mother and father stand for some sort of security which I seem to need, even though I haven't lived at home with them for more than two years.

So, in a loud voice I yelled, ""We're awake"". When I actually did wake up, I asked my husband whether he heard me yell and he said he didn't. Neither were my father-in-law & the maid talking outside our door. It seemed so real, that it was hard to believe that it wasn't.

"0060"	"None"	"(Code 010, Age 21, 10/10/47) I was traveling somewhere by bicycle with several other girls and somehow I got separated from them -- it seems to me that people that knew me kept stopping me and asking me questions, thus detaining me from catching up with my friends. I remember riding up out a hill with a building on it and seeing a trail going into the woods. I started to ride onto this train but realized that it would soon be dark (it was 5:45) and I didn't want to be lost in the woods after dark - so I returned to the hill with a very frustrated feeling at having lost my friends. I remember having said ""hello"" to my sister as I was trying to catch up -- she didn't detain me, though. Interpretation I don't know why I was frustrated.

It was about 6 o'clock in the morning and she wanted to drive to jail alone but I insisted that I'd take her. She felt very badly about having to go to jail, and I tried to comfort her. When I went out to get the car, I couldn't back out of the driveway because a black car was parked horizontally across the driveway. I wasn't very worried about my mother having to go to jail because I was positive she was innocent. Somewhere, a slouchy looking man with a hat on kept beckoning with his finger to me but I only made faces at him to try to scare him away. Interpretation I find it impossible for me to interpret it.

Then it seemed that people had been asking me for money for one thing and another until I had none left--I was mad about that. I went downstairs and on the way to the stairs I remember seeing a woman at a switchboard and a man on an elevator. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there were so many people there and when I saw my husband coming down the stairs, I decided to play games with him and hide. But he went home without me, and I started walking home on the country road in the dark. Finally, someone in a coach pulled by horses picked me up and it was raining. Then I woke up. Interpretation I interpret the idea of the Catholics taking my money as originating from my hearing older people talk of how much money the Catholic Church asks its members to give.

Then two policemen were there protecting us from the bandits who had run around the house somewhere. The policemen had their pistols all ready to shoot if one of the bandits should appear. There was a street car waiting to leave right beside our house, but it wasn't going near my home. A friend of one of the girls picked her up, and I begged the girl to take me home but she wasn't going my way either. I kept trying to call my Dad to ask him to come after me.

The rest of us were angered at this, for that left only a few for the rest of us. When the plate was then passed to me, I took two rolls, feeling a little guilty but rationalizing by observing that they were small. Later, one of the girls who had received the extra rolls said that she didn't know why the waitress had given her so many, and that she didn't think she could eat them.

Her husband and I took her to the hospital and secretly I hoped she wouldn't get well so that her husband and I could be together but I also felt terrible at thinking these thoughts. Interpretation This could be an inner desire to meet a man with whom I immediately fall in love and don't have to develop this love. It seems too that I am not going to allow my parents to interfere as they might have done in the past. I am happier without them, in this dream. But probably I have the feeling that anything good that happens to me has its drawbacks for the wife enters. She either becomes ill at seeing her husband with me or else has been sick and that is why he goes out with others.

We climbed many steps and didn't know where to turn or go. (Each of the girls were approximately my age and were girls with whom I attend school.) Interpretation I interpret this dream as referring to M-- and its sororities. The Sociology class to me stands for the Sorority system, and the steps which we climbed stands for the different Sorority functions we attended.

A man, who was the head of the place, came up to our group and without saying a work we knew it was our turn to die next. He took us downstairs to a small room in which there was a table, a mirror and some chairs. We asked for some leniency because of our young age. He said all right for a while. Then we found out we were already dead and, those upstairs were mourning for us and going through a ceremony. We still felt very much alive but somehow guilty and depressed. Later he came in again and told us our time was up and that we would have to be put in our coffins. I remember being transferred to New York with a boyfriend of mine, sitting in a sidewalk cafe with him but hearing no sounds and then being transferred back to the coffin. Interpretation It seems to me that this is some sort of a death wish either on my part or a wish that others would die.

"0110"	"None"	"(Code 017, Age 20, 05/23/47) Many people including my family and friends were sitting on very comfortable chairs and couches in a huge, beautiful room with columns and pillars all around the room. Straight ahead was a section with steps leading up to a space occupied by a very long desk. Seated at the desk was a man dressed in a judges' robes. A friend turned to me and told me to notice that the man in the judges' robes was a fellow I was dating. Then at the other end of the room music started playing. This fellow in the judges' robes came down, stood directly in front of me and asked me to dance with him. Interpretation I think the courtroom scene came to me because I was reading about the acquittal of 28 men who were accused of lynching a Negro in the South. The pillars and columns were a result of my taking an art appreciation course and having to notice such things. The fellow I dated dressed as a judge seemed to represent the idea that actually he is the one who has to make the decision as to whether or not he wants me and his asking me to dance represents the marriage proposal which unconsciously I want, I think.

There were about 5 or 6 problems and I felt that if I was only able to do just a couple I would fail as there were only so few. Can't remember exactly what type of problems, but they seemed to be long involved ones where there was large amount of multiplying and dividing. I worked the first two or so out satisfactory, but then I wasn't able to do the rest. Could feel myself becoming anxious and tense. I looked at my watch, it was almost 3 o'clock. Class would be over soon and I had only done a few. In my dream I felt as if I was facing the same thing again, that is I could only go so far in some thing, but never completely work it through. Don't remember what happened from there, whether I handed the paper in or not. It did move out of the room. I was in a class room, to a place by myself - Cannot identify any other person. Interpretation While on duty in the hospital yesterday I had an occasion to work some dosage problems, However, I did work it out satisfactory, but only after a second attempt. Had the same sense of being uncomfortable, but not quite as intense as in the dream. Think perhaps this might be one of the factors which caused me to dream about solving problems. Perhaps the uncomfortable and tense feeling I had earlier in the day still remained with me and when I was not able to consciously suppress it, it again came out. For some reason for which I can't explain I felt in my dream the way I felt about an examination I took in German last June, discouraged and tense.

It began coming faster and flooding the room. I was unable to stop it. I went out to the desk, called some one to come to repair it. When I returned to the room the water seemed to be a couple of feet high so I moved the bed out of the room down the hall by the desk, but the water seemed to continue to flow down the hall - What happened after that I can't remember Don't know if the water was turned off or not. Interpretation Recently I had taken care of my friend while she underwent an operation. I had not seen her since she has returned home from the hospital, and I have been wondering how she is.

Then I went over and sat on the floor, and I found that I able to sit with my legs crossed which I can't do in actuality because of a congenital condition, and I was so amused and surprised -- I kept telling every one and showing them how I could sit. In the dream some one was displaying objects which could be sold, for some purpose or another. She held up a pair of stockings, nylons, and I remember every one made a rush to get a pair. But I did not go, but remained sitting. Interpretation That same evening I remember reading a notice in the bulletin board about one of the students was a distributor for hose for some company. Perhaps that had some thing to do - the part about the stockings also as a child growing up I have always felt disturbed about the fact I could never sit like the other children, and as I was on the heavy side I thought it was because I was over weight; which I have found out it was not due to that.

Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people. Interpretation I have recently had more contact with the hospital, which I haven't had for some time and I often times have to go through the clinic to go home at night and I see patients waiting patiently and hopefully.

I remember calling to another person, apparently the owner of the store to come over & show this boy how to count.

I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in C--, as I knew he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in C-- to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked C-- and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned. Interpretation I feel this dream is significant because of what it represents. This boy and his wife were our dearest friends. When they left town, it affected. me for quite a while. The fact that he came back in my dream was a way of expressing an unfulfilled desire. (I wanted them to come back). Also, they had set out to find work. Our friend had finished school. The very fact that he came back to school here, and not, for example, to a job here, shows that school represents security to me. I felt happy because he came back to school.

Any hostility for my mother which I have was expressed in this death dream. The pity I felt for my father is significant of my feelings toward him.

"0163"	"None"	"(Code 025, Age 21, 12/21/49) I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar and was watching the conductor operate the car. I began to notice the lever which he turned when we rounded a bend. It soon felt as though I were operating the car with him. When we came to a sharp corner, I went through the motions of turning the lever and steering the car. The next thing I knew, I was on top of the car which had now turned into a train. It seemed as though I was very high up and the train was traveling very fast. Several times I nearly fell off, and I felt very frightened. I was also afraid that I would attempt to jump off. I was particularly anxious when the train rounded a bend.

I called my mother to come immediately and told her to get the doctor. When she came to the bathroom I had already glued my foot back to my leg with the hope that the blood would coagulate and would harden and help keep my foot stuck to my leg.

I had the feeling that there were a great many people here, some of them strangers, yet I could only see a few familiar faces....most of them my family (mother, father, mother-in-law, sister-in-law). I then remember being in the kitchen getting ready to serve and some of the women had come in to help me. I remember dishing out noodles and soup into small bowls and serving them amidst a great deal of confusion. I then discovered to my dismay that I had not prepared enough food for everyone. I served the main course feeling very embarassed, but my sisters-in-law were assuring me that there was enough for everyone. Interpretation Two weeks ago I held a largee family dinner at my home.

I remember seeing some woman with a grey P-- lamb coat there and I remember walking down the street wlth these people. She held my hand and led the way for me. Someone suggested we go to a large garage where he knew we could get a car, but he gave the impression that he would have to go thru a lot of red tape to get it. At the garage, everyone seemed very secrative. We got into the car and I knew we felt guilty because it was something we were not supposed to do.

I was a truck coming toward me and I did not know where the brake was. The truck gradually stopped as it approached me, but my car kept going and began pushing the truck in a backward direction.

"0168"	"None"	"(Code 025, Age 19, ??/??/47) I was sitting in a corner of my room which is on the fourth floor of a dormitory here at school. A boy was perched on my window sill. This boy is about 23 years old and is the brother of a boy my age whom I dated two or three times my senior year in high school. On the tennis courts which are below my window, a group of people were playing volley ball. Someone hit the ball quite hard causing it to come up to my window. The boy caught it and instead of throwing it down, he jumped. from the window with it. I ran to the window and watched him fall to the ground. very, very slowly. He hit the ground so hard that his head split open and I could see the blood spurt out. Interpretation The reason for my dreaming was probably because I had forgotten to turn off the heat or raise the window and it had become quite warm in my room.

My father opened the trunk of the car to get the suitcases but they were not there. He had left them at the hotel in which he had lived for a short time after my parents were divorced. Dad and I went to the hotel to get them leaving the others at the bus station. We arrived at the hotel but it seemed a very long time before we left because my father's wife kept delaying us. We finally left the hotel but Dad took a very long way to the station and drove very slowly. I urged him to drive faster so I wouldn't miss the bus but he would not. He flnally arrived and there at the station saw my father's secretary waving the bus tlckets in her hand. We had missed the bus. I turned to my father and asked him to please not bring H-- (his wife) with him any more when I had to catch a bus. I then opened my suitcase to see what J--  had packed for me and saw my pink blouse lying on top with a button off.

"0170"	"None"	"(Code 025, Age 19, 02/14/48) My dream is in three different parts and places which did not seem to have any interrelation. The flrst part took place in the kitchen at home. My mother had bought a new brown leather davenport and I was looking at it and wondering why it was in the kitchen. In the next part I was suddenly out in the snow walking along a little path. There was nothing around me for miles but walking along in front of me was a boy who kept getting farther away from me. It was getting dark and the snow was getting deeper. I called to the boy in front of me that it was getting dark and that we should go over to the road so we wouldn't get lost. I recognized the boy, let us call him W, to be a friend of my girl friend here at school. I walked over to the road which was quite slippery and began sliding along. Then suddenly I was in the living room of my dormitory. It was quite different from the way the room really is. I had two callers. One was the boy to whom I am pinned and the other was a friend whom I had dated at home during the summer. (Let us call the boy to whom I am pinned K-- and the other B) Both were sitting on the same couch reading a newspaper. I was unsure of how to handle the situation. I was afrald Ken would be angry because of the other boy. I introduced them but instead of calling Ken by his right name, I called him my brother's name. Then I was once again in the kitchen and the new brown couch had a red leather cover on it. Interpretation The brown leather couch was probably connected with the couches in the living room of the fraternity house of the boy to whom I am pinned. The snow was probably connected with the snow on the ground now. The fact that my brother, who is 24, and I are very close may have caused me to introduce K-- by my brother's name. Our kitchen at home is trimmed in red so that might account for the red cover for the couch. Answers to questions None"

"0203"	"None"	"(Code 032, Age 20, 02/14/48) I was living with my family in a neighborhood of large, impressive houses. The neighbors were not very friendly. I was standing on a lawn feeling lonely when my aunt appeared. She is about forty. Suddenly, down the street, rode my grandmother on a bright red motor scooter. She was riding very fast and going around corners all the time. My aunt just smiled indulgently. Then a group of girls came up to me and said they had heard my father was a famous baseball player and they wanted to meet him. I took them to a large building. We went inside and walked through a lot of narrow passages and came to two swinging doors. We opened them and saw a gymnasium and some men playing basket ball.

A couple of men went down to see how the experiment came out. They brought the victims upstairs. They were still alive, but my aunt's hair had turned gray and she was haggard looking. I was afraid to look at her. Interpretation That evening someone had been telling me about shock treatments for mental patients. A few days previous, I had seen my aunt for the first time in a year.

"0214"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 12/??/47) I dreamt that I was at the C-- skating club at a carnival. I don't remember being with anyone in particular. There were a great many people standing around however. I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up. Interpretation I have been told that this type of dream where you are out in public without any clothes on and not being able to move, is a very common dream, and I have also been told that it is indicative of feelings of insecurity. Any further explanation, I can not give, on second thought the fact that I do not skate and would like to be able to skate might be the reason for my insecure feelings. I definitely had the sensation that I didn't belong because I couldn't skate. Answers to questions 2. I had the feeling of frustration in that I could not move or put my clothes on. A slight bit of fear at all the people ignoring me was also present. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. In a large skating rink. 6. Yes, and always after I have been to that same place.

"0215"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 01/??/48) As nearly as I can recall, my dream began on an airplane. My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up. Interpretation My knowledge of the causes and reasons for dreams is practically nil. This dream I remembered the next morning, as if it had actually happened. I gave each part thought, and these are my only results. I dislike flying, although when I have flown, no terrifying thing has happened. Perhaps the fact that my first flight was because of the need to return home from college on my father's death. As for my anger over going such a round about way; maybe that has some relationship for my liking to get places in a hurry for fear of missing something. The sensation of falling through space I have frequently in dreams. I have no fear of high places, deep water, and the like. Some say that that falling sensation may be partially attributed to insecurity of one kind or another. The general restlessness of the whole dream might be tied up with my always present nervousness before exam periods. Answers to questions 2. My most prominent emotions were that I was angry, afraid, and annoyed. My feelings were definitely hostile, and also feelings of doubt. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. The setting was in an airplane during flight. 6. No 7. No"
"0216"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 02/13/48) I recall that my dream began with the sensation of getting off a boat. I was laughing at someone in front of me but I do not recall who it was. There was no one else around at that time. The next thing I remember was that I was in some large building of some kind, yet I remember that the building was surrounded by water and that I was walking all by myself through a dark tunnel way of some kind. All of a sudden I ran into a teacher I had. in high school, my chemistry teacher a woman I hated thoroughly. In my dream I was pleased to see her. With her was a girl that I met one summer while traveling. They asked me to get them a radio so they could listen to some music. I told them I couldn't because I was lost and I remember that I was awfully hungry. They told me that there was no food anywhere. I remember that I began to get frightened and tried to run. The door would not open so I ran the other way for what seemed to be hours, and the next thing I remember I was in my living room. Everyone in the room was looking out the windows at a big lake. On it were millions of big boats and they were all on fire. Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed. Interpretation This dream was just before I got up, therefore it was not a sound sleep. We spend summers on a lake each year, and the night before we had been discussing next summer's plans. The fire, etc., might be explained by the fact that I had just seen a movie in which there was a great deal of fire. Fires always impress me because from the age of one I have been taught the dangers of forest fires in particular, whether the fact that I had eaten a hamburger etc. just before going to bed, has anything to do with my being hungry, is a mystery to me. On the other hand, being a dream near breakfast time, it could. be reflecting my anticipating breakfast. Answers to questions 2. The only emotion that I recall was when I woke up, and that was surprise rather than fright. 3. An actual participant. 4. Both pleasant and unpleasant. 5. The setting varies as is explained, but it seems to me that I spent more time in that tunnel than anywhere else. 6. No 7. I remember that the fire was a definite red."
"0217"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 02/27/48) I dreamt that I was riding along in a big car, only it wasn't exactly a car. I was sitting in a big easy chair which had with it a long footrest. In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed. I remember saying to myself that I mustn't lie down even for a minute because the others would worry. However, the next thing I remember was waking up with that awful feeling that they had gone without me, and that I couldn't comb my hair and that I was a wreck in general. At that moment I woke up. Interpretation This dream makes little sense to me. No part of it can I logically explain. Answers to questions 2. The dream didn't bother me. I felt rather amused throughout the whole episode. 3. An actual participant. 4. Pleasant. 5. Most of the dream took place in the car and in that rest room. 6. No 7. No"
"0218"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 02/28/48) I dreamt last night that I was at a friend of mine's house at a fairly large party. Everyone was sitting around drinking beer and some were dancing. I remember that most of the people there I hadn't seen for a long time. I remember no specific people but I seemed to know them well enough to talk to them. Then I went into the kitchen where there were several people, and I stepped up to one person (I don't know who it was or even whether it was a boy or girl). I remember I screamed but nobody paid any attention to me or the person I choked. If I remember correctly, they went right on talking and laughing. The next thing I remember was running down what seemed to be stairs that never came to an end. Then I tripped and fell headfirst down the stairs and woke up with that falling through space sensation. Interpretation I was at a party that night, but I knew all the people. There were actually only about six or eight of us there. We did sit out in the kitchen and one boy fell off one of the kitchen stools. I imagine that might explain my falling down the stairs in my dream. Answers to questions 2. I remember only that I was very mad when everyone ignored the fact that I killed that person. 3. An actual participant. 4. Both pleasant and unpleasant. 5. In the house of an old classmate of mine. 6. No 7. No"
"0219"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 03/01/48) I was standing in a large open space with nothing surrounding me but a large stone wall on one side. I recall that there were some people mingling around but who they were I don't know. Then I walked over to the wall and sat down. I began to eat a sandwich and it seemed that I kept eating and eating on that same one. A person was sitting next to me, a man that I know only casually, and I remember we were talking about how silly the other people were to get in line. By this time various people had gotten in line right in front of us. I remember we were sitting cross legged and that the sun was very hot. The next thing I remember was standing in line myself. I had that awful feeling that I was going to fall down any minute. At this moment I became conscious of a long glass paneling affair surrounding everyone. Through the glass I could see nothing but space, and the next thing I knew I was falling through space and I woke up. Interpretation The only thing that I could connect with actual life here is the fact that I had been on a picnic just prior to this dream. Answers to questions 2. I recall no feeling in particular, even when I fell through space. I should say that I was more or less indifferent. 3. An actual participant. 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. I'm not too sure of the setting outside of the fact that there were wide open spaces (no trees, houses, etc.). 6. No 7. No"
"0220"	"None"	"(Code 033, Age 21, 03/06/48) I was walking down town and it was raining very hard. But I have no recollection that I was getting wet. I was with my sister, who is five years my senior, and married. We went in and out of stores and came out of each store with our hands full. Yet before we went into the next store, our arms were again empty, where we left the stuff I have no idea. After doing this for it seemed hours, I recall we were driving along a very narrow tunnel and every once in awhile we would pass some one we knew but we never said anything to them. All the time we were driving along I also had the sensation of going up, as if in an elevator. The next thing I remember was being in swimming in a river with millions of people, because I recall they were all yelling to me to take off my hat and shoes. I was laughing and I don't think I paid any attention to them. Then I remember getting out, and I was home in bed. At that moment the alarm went off, and I remember how surprised I was to find myself actually in bed. Interpretation I had been down town prior to this dream but the only place I went was to the movies and not with my sister. The hat might be tied up with the fact that I hate hats, and only wear one when I have to; like when going down town. Answers to questions 2.

There were many people in the room--but I can not remember who any of them were, except one man who I met at a concert in Boston--I have not seen or heard of him since. I recall he had a long broom in his hand, and appeared to be telling the guests who the people on the books were. They were in the majority, my classmates at college. Something he was saying about them was making me mad, and I remember I yelled something at him and he disappeared and suddenly I was alone in the library--I recall trying to leave but there was no door--then I woke up.

One of the bodies turned around and I recognized her as the sister of a friend of mine. (This friend at one time meant very much to me. We had planned to be married as soon as I finished college.) The sister, R--, showed surprise at seeing me, as she didn't realize that I was the counselor she had made an appointment with. She made some remark about my being successful and also about my settling down and getting married. I realized then that she thought my brother was my husband. I proceeded to introduce him to all the people. Mr. D., R's father, did not remember me at all, and R explained to me that his memory was failing. R and I then went into my office which seemed to be in the basement of my sister's home. In the basement I had my desk, which was cluttered with papers etc. There were colorful rugs on the floor. She told me her reason for coming. It seems that her brother was in trouble and she was trying to help him. He had stolen something and was sent to jail. I was quite nervous as these people were my first counselees and at the same time I couldn't possibly see how I was going to help them as long as he had been caught stealing. I felt perplexed because I didn't feel as if I were capable of helping them. While I was talking to her, I was also trying to hurry up the case, as my sister had bought some new rugs & I wanted to see them. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2.

In the middle was a bridge and underneath it were damp wet leaves, grass, etc. I seemed to be the only one skating but there were several men standing around watching. One man was standing underneath the bridge and motioned for me to come near him. I tried to ignore him but the bridge seemed to be magnetized and I was drawn to him. He began to put his arms around me and I attempted to release his grasp. It seemed that I had no strength in my arms at all. I started to scream as I was terrified but I still had hopes that my screams would attack the other men's attention & they would come to my rescue.

"0237"	"None"	"(Code 034, Age 22, 10/28/47) This dream took place on our farm. It concerned my brother, sister, father, and me. We had done something to antagonize my father and consequently, we were running away from him. It seemed to be in the fall because we were running through hayfields & cornfields. The corn was taller than we so we thought it would hide us from our father. The three of us got separated & I hid in a building, which was on a neighboring farm. My father followed me rather than my brother or sister. He saw me run into this building and I knew it; so I knew that sooner or later he would come in & get me. For a while, he was running around the building pretending to look for me. This attracted the neighbors attention and soon there were three or four people standing around. My only consolation was that I thought my father wouldn't punish me very severely in front of the neighbors. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2.

There wasn't much traffic so I was going pretty fast. Ahead, I could see a car parked & a big greyhound bus coming. I thought I could pass the parked car before I met the bus but I couldn't. We collided & we all got out to see the damages. I told A___ that I had no driver's license but not to mention the fact.

Two of my neighbors, who are 8 and 12 years of age, were standing near the table passing out my graduation pictures to anyone who wanted them. I was trying to stop them and at the same time I was wondering how I was going to pay for them. The gifts on the table were for me.

I fell in love with the desert--it was beautiful. I had the feeling of being free. Here in C-- I have seemed to have developed a terrible feeling of claustrophobia. In the first place, it is a dirty city. I have seen nothing of real beauty since I've been here -- just ugly houses and barren trees. I like the feeling of being able to look for miles across the wide open spaces.

My father, 53 yrs., comes into the picture and tries to help her but can do nothing.--All at once my mouth is filled with blood and my front teeth begin to fall out--dream ends. Interpretation Actually I was two years old when one of my brothers was killed by a truck. He was seven at the time. I remember nothing about him, but have often wondered what the facts were concerning the accident.

About two days before I had this dream, the maid here in the dorm told me that once she took an overdose of sleeping tablets, and that if they had waited another hour before taking her to a hospital she would have died.

I remember saying to a friend the day before this dream, that I was bored with the girls in the dorm and dorm life, and that I would give anything to take a trip, preferably to the mountains, just to ""get away from it all"" for awhile. This feeling was probably responsible for such a dream. Answers to questions 2. Happy 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. Yes. I have had dreams before where I was climbing mountains, but never were they so vivid as this one. 6. Yes--of the light brown color of the mountain and of the pure blue sky above."
"0262"	"None"	"(Code 038, Age 20, 03/06/47) To begin with, I dreamed that my father had been killed while working on the railroad. I seemed to be crying and could feel the choking in my throat. The scene changed and I was in C--. My aunt (40 yrs. old) told me that she and my uncle (58) were getting a divorce. I asked her why and she said that she knew he was still in love with his former wife. The scene changed again, and I was uptown in P-- with my cousin, the daughter (17 yrs.) of the couple written about above. We were crossing the main street and narrowly missed being hit by an automobile. Dream ended. Interpretation Not long ago I had a letter saying that lightning struck the freight car on which my father was on, and by pure luck he was not killed. That probably accounts for the first part of my dream, as I have thought about the incidence quite a bit. My uncle and aunt did talk of divorce once, and it is true that he has never gotten over the love for his first wife. It was probably in my mind because the day before this dream I had spoken of these relatives to another person. The day before this dream, another girl and I were almost hit by an automobile. Here it was my cousin, probably because of just dreamlng about her mother and father. Answers to questions 2. It was a morbid dream.

I left her for a few moments and met an older man (who is about 40 years old, was the chaperon on a couple of geology trips I was on and who apparently took a great interest in me). He asked me to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks with him. We started walking toward the city hall and all at once the street and sidewalks were crowded with 'madly' rushing people shouting and screaming. We stopped and heard the sound of explosions, each one getting louder than the one before. Some one cried that the world was coming to an end. We started running back to the library and then stopped again as we saw a car sliding sidewards, going at a rapid speed, which hit another car. Here I seemed to realize that the people in cars were driving as fast as they could in order to escape the explosions and death. People were thrown out of one of the cars. Two people seemed to have been killed. Dream ended. Interpretation I probably dreamed of this certain man because I had just had a letter from him. I account for dreaming about explosions because the day before this dream I had commented to some one about how terrible it was that there have been so many explosions lately--L. A.  C--, C--. We also discussed the atomic bomb and the fact that it is possible for the world to be destroyed by it.

One of the girls in the sorority which had asked me to join told me that she knew I really didn't like them and that I had told everyone that they did not date very often. The scene shifted to one of the sorority houses (none of them have any). Someone was telling me that ""our house""--presumably I was living at an independent student dorm similar to one in which I lived while at the U--- of W--- would have to break up next semester because all of the girls were moving into sorority houses. I was very perturbed because my friends would all be separated and, since my sorority did not have a house, I would have no place to live. Interpretation Because of rush week and the various sorority parties, sororities have been the topic of conversation. My friends and I are divided on the opinion of which we want to join, and I imagine that is the reason for the dream. Answers to questions 2.

"0280"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 02/17/47) This dream had many parts, none of which seemed to be related. First I was square dancing on roller skates and found it very difficult to stop. Then I was taking care of a baby who had very bright blond hair. He swallowed something and my mother and I shook him until it came out. We then put him on the porch to sleep in the sun and he turned very tan. He was to be Bing Crosby's fifth son. Suddenly I was at the home of some married friends. Two of our mutual friends arrived, one of whom I dated extensively this summer. I found it necessary to laugh hysterically in their presence. I also urinated in their presence experiencing no emotion while doing so and feeling as if it were a natural occurrence. I then found myself in my own home and my great uncle who has been dead for two years visited us. I asked him why I hadn't seen him for so long, sat in his lap and he stroked my hair as he had done when I was very young. I then watched a boy whom I know only very casually have an epileptic fit--I have never witnessed one in real life. Interpretation The only part of the dream I can attempt to explain is the one in which I urinated in front of the man with whom I was in love and our friend who is at present one of my best friends and with whom I have a platonic relationship. They have both told me that I was inhibiting my sexual desires and afraid of sex. Perhaps I wished to show them that I could be very frank and open about sex. Also, the fact that I found it necessary to laugh when I saw them was my desire to show them that I was not unhappy because we had ""broken up."" As a matter of fact, in real life I was unhappy about the situation for quite some time. Answers to questions 2. Fright when the baby gagged, relief when I knew he would be all right, Joy at my great-uncle's presence, horror while watching the epileptic. 3. Participant 4. Both 5. No 6.

"0281"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 02/18/47) I had to leave a gathering of several M-- acquaintances at which we were seated around a table singing. I had to take part in a Valentine's Day program to be given at my former elementary school. The girls handed me what they thought was my coat, and then another, and then another until they finally came to mine. I remember that all of the coats were dark green although they differed in style. Arriving at the school I asked one of the children how to get on the stage and he directed me. I know I had a costume, but I don't remember it except for a Mexican blouse, and I don't remember my part, The face and name of the Master of Ceremonies kept changing, but he was always the same person. A professor of psychology whose course I took in another university walked down the aisle from the audience with his notes under his arm. He walked to a magazine rack which was at one side of the stage and picked up different magazines, all of which had a cover design depicting winter and snow flurries, sleighs, etc., and one of which was titled the Philadelphia Story. He then walked to the Master of Ceremonies, they kissed, and he took over the remainder of the program. Interpretation The only phase of this dream I can possibly interpret is my part in a program and the Mexican blouse as part of the costume. I did a Mexican dance in a program given at the university from which I transferred. I cannot explain anything else. Answers to questions 2. No particular emotion. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. No 6.

The odd thing was that at each landing there was a candy or popcorn stand & I kept insisting that one of my friends was hungry & that she get something to eat. When we finally found seats they were in a single file & we had to sit one in back of the other.

The back door wouldn't close and I drove with one hand and kept trying to slam the door with the other. I arrived at my friend's apartment in M-- B--, but it was in C--. Everyone was walking around downtown C-- in beach clothes, very tan. My friend, her parents and several other girls were in the apartment. A man knocked on the door and said he had come to borrow something. He was eating sections of an orange. I remember remarking on the attractiveness of the kitchen. It was all red and white. There was a silent butler of bright red lying on the table. Some of my friends at the apartment were speaking of a birthday luncheon for another friend to which I had not been invited. One of the girls present was a casual friend at the U-- of W--, two were from M--. The girl from W-- was wearing a white half slip. I stood there in a black half slip.

They kept coming in and finally the clothes rack was so crowded not another thing could be squeezed in. A boy in whom I am not at all interested came into my room while I was studying. Then I saw us in bed, I only partially clothed. I kept assuming provocative positions and teasing him. Finally he grabbed and kissed me, and I very coldly told him to leave the house. He then went to the bathroom and I wondered whether he would use my pretty yellow towel. I can remember other bits of the dream--red carnations and a bottle of perfume that was found in the back of an old drawer. The bottle was gold and shaped oddly like a flask or a snake. I opened it and everyone said the perfume was lovely but I couldn't smell it and I, very panicky, kept asking, ""Why can't I smell it? Why can't I smell it?"" I rubbed it all over my hands in order to be able to. Interpretation No interpretation. Answers to questions 2. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. No 6. Gold perfume bottle, red carnations, yellow towel."
"0285"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 05/16/47) I dreamed that I was with a very good friend of mine. (We both use our relationship as proof of the possibility of platonic love.) However, in the dream, seated or standing, our bodies were intertwined and neither could move without the other moving. Our hands, feet, legs, etc. were lapped over each other. Another part of the dream in which my friend was not presented related to a meeting I had to attend. It was to be held in the dining hall of a church and I kept walking up flights of stairs through room after room, looking for my meeting & only finding Sunday School classes. Interpretation My friend & I are seen together so frequently on campus that many people have asked us if we were ""going steady."" This always amuses us as we consider each other simply as very good friends. Perhaps the intertwined bodies symbolized our ""togetherness."" However, I was surprised & aware during the dream that our closeness was not unaccompanied by an exotic feeling. Actually I had received notice of a meeting to be held in the dining hall of a church & I remarked then that I hadn't the slightest idea where it was. Answers to questions 2. No predominant emotion 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. Someone's living room. Rooms of a church 6. No 7. No"
"0286"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 05/17/47) This dream is very vague and hard to recall. I know I was sitting on the grass with a school friend. A car drew up & a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, ""He must be related to S--."" I have spent several months ""getting over"" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over & spoke to us & he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, ""Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care."" I also kept telling him my name & was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime. I think I awoke & then dreamed of being in a hospital--for lunch or something else other than illness. I waited for an elevator in a tri-cornered section. I don't remember much more except that we had a cafeteria-type luncheon & doctors kept wheeling out huge contraptions that looked like the side of a building. Interpretation Actually S--- is not bald, but he is being married very soon. His dream brother was quite young & good-looking whereas his brother in real life is much older than he. I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction. I think the fact that I dreamed of a brother is significant because I have felt for some time that S--- has an inferiority complex because of his brother who is in the same profession as S--- and is one of the top men in his field. Perhaps rather than give him his just attributes I made him young & good-looking rather than very brilliant and very kind. No interpretation for second part of dream. Answers to questions 2.

"0287"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 03/20/47) A boy named Charles Brown was living secretly in our garage. No one knew he was there & he didn't know that we knew, but we wanted to protect him. A letter for him came to the house and I slipped it under the garage door. It turned out to be new license plates. A colored man came up the driveway while I was standing on the back porch with a girl friend. I pushed her into the house and I too went in and tried to lock the door. It was very difficult, but I finally got it locked. Then I saw a boy I had dated for a long time and whom I had considered marrying. He is now married. He was wearing a very gaudy suit, but it was beautifully tailored. He told me that he was still in love with me before he got married, and in my dream he told me to forget what he had said and that he was really happily married. A younger sister of a M--- acquaintance came into my room and jumped up and down on my toes. I turned her over my knees and spanked her. I went shopping with a girl I dislike. She wanted a mouton coat. They showed her one, and I said, ""That's not an imitation beaver. That's an imitation Persian."" I was to meet my mother and a girlfriend at the H---. My mother--who doesn't smoke--came into the lobby smoking from a long cigarette holder. Interpretation It's difficult for me to find any consistent strain in the various parts of this dream. The boy named Charles was red headed and I've become interested in a red haired boy, if that means anything. I think my old friend's telling me he was happily married is a product of guilt feelings on my part--that he may have married to spite me and that he isn't happy because of me. The gaudy but well-tailored suit is typical of him, and one of the things to which I most objected as being so much a part of his ""showy"" personality. Answers to questions 2. Frightened when the colored man came up the drive. No particular emotion during the rest of the dream. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. No 6. Red hair. Loud blue and yellow striped suit."

Someone was sitting on the landing above, fishing, and we kept trying to keep out of reach of the hooks. I imagine we could have gotten away but somehow we had to stay. In another fragment of the dream I was driving a truck and two of my school friends were with me. We went from store to store buying books. I could see myself shifting gears & even said in the dream, ""Now put her in second, now third,"" etc. Interpretation I have no interpretation, but I do wonder about driving. This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream. Perhaps this is because I want to learn to drive & the only thing I can do now is shift gears, but I don't think I want to drive that badly. Perhaps there is some other explanation. Answers to questions 2. 3. Participant 4. First part unpleasant, latter pleasant 5. I have dreamt of driving & shifting gears before--never of driving a truck, though. 6. No"

We had a son about two years old. We put him to bed and prepared for bed ourselves. Somehow I hadn't had marital relations with my husband at all except once years ago. I knew that tonight we would--I had no reason for not having slept with him until now, but we were certainly on good terms. Just as we got into bed I realized I hadn't taken my bath. I said I'd be right back & not to go to sleep until I did come back. When I went to the bathroom another girl from an adjoining apartment was running the water. I told her I was in a hurry & to please take her bath next door. She did. I took my bath & rushed back to the bedroom. My husband was asleep. I felt a very strong physical desire to intercourse--I mean I felt it while I was asleep, but it was extremely strong.

The rooms were divided by large pillars & we drove right into the house. It was quite a test of driving skill because the pillars were close on either side of the car. I talked to the boy's sister while the others went upstairs to get him. We heard the sound of footsteps outside & looked for prowlers. The wind howled. The boy was just back from the U--- of I--- & said he was D--- C---'s roommate. The sister had red hair & turned out to be only 14 after I thought she was my age. I woke up, looking for & expecting to find a prowler in my room. I went back to sleep & found myself selecting saddle leather handbags. The clerk was a girl who used to work for my Dad & whom I have seen several times recently. All the bags were soiled and marked down. The scene shifted to the dime store where I was selecting jade rings. They must have been made of candy, because I nonchalantly chewed one of them. One was the figure of a Mexican, another a turban-covered face. I was with an older woman I knew but cannot now identify. She was holding my watch for me. It was five o'clock & we couldn't put our call through to Italy since it was three o'clock there, and also because of the telephone strike. Interpretation I have been looking for a saddle leather bag, so that part of the dream seems simple enough. Why I should be calling Italy--I am not Italian nor do I have any Italian friends---is beyond me. D-- C-- was in a movie I had seen a few days before dreaming. I cannot explain the U-- of I--. -- I know no one there. The prowler incident terrified me & I did expect to see one in my room when I awoke. Answers to questions 2. Afraid in prowler incident, envious at large home 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Car, other person's home, store, dime store. 6. No 7. Jade rings, saddle tan handbags, red hair"
"0292"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 04/??/47) I argued with my brother. We were in my room. He threw me to the floor & began dragging me around. I remembered being afraid of getting floor burns. When I came near to my dressing table I pulled at the skirt of it until the thumbtacks fell out. I gathered a handful of the tacks and when my brother approached again I threw them directly at his face. I saw his face vividly. He was wearing his glasses. Interpretation Although my brother and I argue frequently we never display the kind of activity seen in my dream and at the time of my dream we were on particularly good terms. Answers to questions 2. Fear & anger 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. My bed room 6. No 7. No"
"0293"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 04/14/47) There was a queen contest. I was the Queen of 0-- and one of my M-- friends was Queen of N.E. M-- & S.W. C-- which was the most important ""queenship."" We were to step forward on the stage, state our name & territory. She, the most important queen, stuttered & faltered. When my turn came I was stately & regal. After the program we assembled downstairs in an auditorium. There were many photographers and several ""drug store cowboy"" type of boys. One said of me, ""She is cute, but I bet she's thirty if she's a day."" My former roommate was there & I told her of seeing the man in whom I had been interested. She told me her friends at school didn't like my future sister-in-law, and why had I given her such a buildup? (They've never met her) I said I hadn't. I was eating dark bread & marmalade & offered her some. The bread slice was so thick she had to cut it through the center. I said, ""here, take the piece with more bananas on it & there appeared small slices of banana on the bread. There were more confused parts that I can't remember. Interpretation No interpretation except that I have wondered several times how my friends would accept my future sister-in-law. I imagine the queen contest was to flatter a needy ego. Answers to questions 2. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. Unfamiliar stage & room 6. No 7. Yellow marmalade, dark brown bread"
"0294"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 04/17/47) I could only remember blurred, confused parts of this dream. I know there was an old, self-service elevator & and my friends operated all through the dream. We'd either stop too high or too low & could never quite adjust to floor level. Something about a man & we, I don't know what cause my friends to say it was his fault & excuse me. I know he was in the dream. We embraced frequently & in their presence. They said our positions were vulgar. I don't remember who he was, but I knew him. I was then in a store choosing oranges for my mother. I said none of them were Juicy enough. Then I was the clerk & apologized for being dressed in a skirt & sweater. Interpretation The elevator was exactly like the one at the place where I worked this past summer. At that time I wasn't terribly adept at handling the elevator. No interpretation for the remainder of the dream. Answers to questions 2. 3. Participant 4. Neither 5. Bare room, elevator shaft 6.

"0295"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 05/01/47) I dreamed that I had a violent argument with my future sister-in-law concerning her shower. The dream itself is not very clear except that she was inviting only her side of the family and was including very little of ours.

I came to live with her--I remember it was out of town. someone else, very fashionable but not very secure financially--I can't remember who it was--came to stay with us. She offered to keep house for us in order to pay & I remember thinking it was a great concession. vaguely I remember we were always taking showers. If my room-mate were taking a shower I handed her clothes through the door. She followed the same procedure with me. I suddenly realized that I wasn't paying & she told me that my mother was paying her mother in C-- for my board but she would appreciate my paying rent.

"0297"	"None"	"(Code 040, Age 20, 05/04/47) I was back visiting my friends at the D-- in W--. I met all the new girls I've heard about & they seemed to know who I was. One of my friends was wearing two fraternity pins & when I asked her why said, ""One's for me & one's his."" Another friend of mine looked at me significantly as if to say ""She's a dope."" The house & rooms were not the same as they are in actuality, but this did not seem to bother me in the dream. I had come somewhere with my mother & it was time to leave. I did not want to take two streetcars & a bus home & it was snowing, etc., so I asked if they could lend me a car. The only one they had was one they said my father had purchased in Europe. It was bright yellow & very strange looking. Instead of my wearing the old-fashioned goggles the car had a sort of goggles & hood affair in front. Whoever it was that gave me the car said there was an over-accumulation of oil. He or she then tipped the car over & the oil--a horrible looking yellow-brown fluid, poured into the mud & strangled some snakes & worms. On the way home there was something about a tennis court I do not remember. Interpretation I had Just received a letter from W-- telling me my friend had been pinned & mentioning some of the new girls at the house. That part of the dream was fairly accurate--I saw only those people who are there though the room was different. The other part of the dream was more vague & hard to interpret. I know that this is at least the fourth time since beginning these records that I have dreamed of cars or driving them. It seems strange that the seasons in my dream were so mixed--snowstorms, tennis courts, etc. Answers to questions 2. Not consious of any particular emotion. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. Strange living room, back yard, car, tennis court. 6. No, but I have dreamt before about cars & driving. 7. Bright yellow car. Yellow-brown thick fluid."
"0298"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 02/01/48) All I could remember of this dream seems to be very scant. I was riding on a horse in the woods. I was conscious of the green grass and the brown bark of the brown trees. After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand. Interpretation Probably the brown horse was my goal. When he threw me off it probably revealed someone blocked my goal and I became frustrated. Although this interpretation might be far from the point it does seem plausible. Lately I am beginning to feel my goal in life is being blocked. Because all my friends are getting engaged and I am beginning to feel that I will be an old maid. My inability to get a husband will probably result in frustration. The interpretation of the horse eating my hand is very clear. On Friday, prior to this dream, I did go to the doctor to see about my finger. From playing golf I received a sore, and this sore developed into a wart. The doctor burned it and nothing remains where the sore had been. The horse in this instance could be the doctor attending to my sore finger. Answers to questions 2. I was very afraid of the horse as he was chewing my arm off.  Excitement and rage followed after I realized what had happened.  I cried because I couldn't tear myself away. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. The woods and countryside. 6. No 7. The green grass and the brown bark of the trees."
"0299"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 02/10/48) I was sitting in the kitchen just doing nothing. The time of day wasn't too clear, although I believe it was early morning. Our family owned two cats; a little black kitten and the huge white mother cat. As I was sitting in the kitchen I could hear the mother cat coming out from the basement. To my surprise, a lion appeared instead of the mother cat. Reluctantly, I rode the lion out to the backyard. After getting off the back of the lion I tied it up to the fence. I might add I tried to tie the lion up to the fence but because I was very frightened I ran back into the house. The dream ended at this point. Interpretation I cannot imagine why I dreamed of cats because I actually hate them. The fact that the white mother cat turned out to be a lion possibly goes to reveal that one of my friends has a duel personality. It could possibly mean that this personal friend of mine is directly related to my goal. It is all very peculiar and hard to interpret. Answers to questions 2. I was afraid of the white cat. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. At first the setting was in the kitchen but shifted later to the backyard. 6. No 7. No"
"0300"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 02/18/48) One Sunday afternoon H., 20 yrs., my girlfriend, I., 23, her fiancee, a girlfriend who I cannot identify, B., 23, and I all went to a dance. These are all my friends. We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her. A boy, I. was there and he was wearing a blue suit and new shoes. After the program all the kids came to my house. My dad was home and so naturally I introduced him to all my friends. He was so funny that everyone had a swell time. The dream ended at this moment. Interpretation Since I have many friends it does seem probable to dream of so many friends. The paladium that resembled the H. Theatre as well as H. probably could be traced back to last year. At that time I had a conflicting cholce to make. I couldn't decide if I should go back to M. University (where I spent my freshman year) or enter F. S. M. College. The change from dancing to singing could be that I recently joined a choir. My interest in music is being stimulated even though I still hold a great interest for dancing. The reason that I. entered my dream seems due to the interest I held in him last semester. Unconsciously, I am still thinking of him, although not consciously. He always wore a blue suit. The new shoes probably is due to the fact that I went out the Saturday night before with a fella that wore new shoes. It may be probable that I would a man assimilated between these two characters. I am very used to having all the friends come over my house so this last part of the dream is very real. Although my dad isn't very funny with my friends. He is very friendly but not very funny. Could it be that I wish my dad to be funny with the company I bring? Answers to questions 2. I was very happy and excited. I did get mad when we weren't going to dance. 3. An actual participant in the dream. 4. Pleasant. 5. Took place at the paladium but then shifted to my home. 6. No 7. Yes, I.'s blue suit. In my home I could see all the furnishings with all the harmony of colors. Blue predominates."

This ice cream store resembled the store that I had been at in N. R., mirrors composed all four walls. The seats were blue leather with yellow additions. After we finished our ice cream we came to my house where we talked with my family. The dream ended at this point. Interpretation I do not know why I dream of this certain boy, B. This is the second time I have done so. It possibly means that unconsciously I want him to like me or visa versa. Since I have been in N. R. before and I loved it could this dream possibly signify that I should be there now? Whenever I bring a fellow back to the house we always talk to my family. Could this mean that my family dominates me? Answers to questions 2. I had a very content feeling. 3. An actual participant. 4. Pleasant. 5. At first it was on our new express busses, then the dream took place in the ice-cream parlor and then back to my house. 6. No answer given. 7. Yes, I was conscious of the yellow and blue chairs."
"0302"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 03/13/48) I was all dressed in a white wedding gown about to march down the aisle. The woman fixed my train and I proceeded to march. I was very excited but very frustrated because my dress seams split on both sides just as I was half way down. I blushed and thought everyone would notice. I kept my arms at the side. I finally reached the altar but was nervous all the time because of the split seams. The ceremony was over and the reception started. The dream ended here. Interpretation I do have a white dress and recently had to fix the dress seam. The dressmaker cut the gown a little too low so I had to piece the white formal. It probably was on my mind as I applied this to a wedding gown, because of the wedding gown being white. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated, excited, nervous. 3. An actual participant. 4. Both pleasant and unpleasant. 5. H. Masonic Temple. 6. No 7. No"
"0303"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 03/22/48) I was down at M. University with my two girlfriends, H. and H. These girls are around 20 and are very good friends of mine. We were in the dorm studying all night for an exam. Around midnight a lot of my friends came into the room. L. K. was wearing a black moire dress. She looked real slim and received many glances from M. B. Now this boy was an old flame of L. While all these people were in our room I started to put on a pair of brown suede shoes. At this time I woke up from my dream. Interpretation It is probable that I wish to be away at school with all my own close friends. This is typical college life which I probably unconsciously yearn for. The girl L. is a good friend of mine although in life she is chubby. Since I am chubby, could possibly wish that I might be slim someday. Probably this dream shows me how I must always have a crowd of people around me. The significance of brown suede shoes is not apparent to me. Answers to questions 2. I was more happy than anything else. 3. An actual participant. 4. Pleasant. 5. My room in the dorm at W. Hall, M.

"0304"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 04/11/48) It was a very clear day -- the day my sister who is 18 and I were to be married. We were coming down the two side aisles in the H.T. I went first with my father leading me and then my sister followed with my mother. We each had four bridesmaids and six ushers. This is a blurred image. We came simultaneously to the altar where all the attendants were displayed on both sides of the altar. The rabbi gave one speech for both of us and then the dream was gone. Interpretation My sister who is younger than me is getting married September 5. Everyone is wishing me to get married at the same time. Obviously, everyone's talking is doing some good if I dream of an exact event. I wouldn't mind at all but circumstances prevent this. Answers to questions 2. I was nervous but smiling all the time. 3. An actual participant in the dream. 4. Pleasant. 5. It was the H. T. synagogue. 6. No. 7. No."
"0305"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 04/14/48) I was at a circus one day. This circus had red and white tents. I was fascinated by the elephants and lions. They were all doing such cute tricks. While this was going on I was in the audience. The feature act was on next and I entered the wing in my gorgeous net costume. I took three bows and then proceeded to swing back and forth. The audience was enraptured but accidentally my foot didn't get hold of the lion rod, and I fell into the net. Here the dream ended. Interpretation I do not know what significance the red tent has but I could see it clearly. Obviously I want to be in the limelight but because of a few discrepancies on my part I do not exceed for long. This is probably in part some explanation of the dream. Maybe I am frustrated because I'm not excellent in sports although I love them. It could also mean I want to endanger my life. Answers to questions 2. I was fascinated and excited. I was scared as I was falling. 3. An actual participant. 4. Both pleasant and unpleasant. 5. It was the main tent of the circus. 6. No. 7. Only of the color red in the tent."

A black and white striped horse broke through the window and carried me away rather roughly. Interpretation Possibly this dream signifies my outlook on life. First I am content although realizing I'm not in satisfactory surroundings and then some obstacle always follows to throw off my happiness and contentment. The horse could have been the obstacle. The coming of the draft is a threat to my future happiness and I am frankly afraid. I don't know if this could tie in or not. Answers to questions 2. I was content but became frightened when the horse appeared. 3. An actual participant. 4. Both pleasant and unpleasant. 5. A dark forest. 6. No. 7. Green."
"0307"	"None"	"(Code 041, Age 20, 05/12/48) I was in Room --- at the time of my English Literature class. Miss W, my professor, was presiding when a girl entered requesting that I come to the office at once. This girl (who I cannot describe) barged in just as I was about to answer a question. I flew out of the room but this girl was not there, by the time I came to the door. Interpretation I dreamed this the night I was studying for my English exam. Probably in my unconscious I was recalling my last semester's class which I hated because of Miss W. The girl was just a figure for escape but one actually can't escape from his duty. I want to escape but it is hopeless. Answers to questions 2. I was having butterflies in my stomach when I was called on in English. 3. An actual participant. 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5.

I was very surprised and I felt hurt all evening. The next thing I remembered I was in my house talking to L., N.'s friend, trying to inquire if N. meant what he said. He said he didn't know. The next thing I dreamed we were broken up. I went around asking everyone who I saw, ""Is it true?"" Interpretation When I dreamed about the ballroom I was anticipating the dance I was going to attend. Probably this dream could mean I want to break up with my boyfriend unconsciously or possibly I am anticipating the outcome. Answers to questions 2. I was very sad and blue. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. My home and a ballroom. 6. No. 7"
"0309"	"None"	"(Code 043, Age 21, ??/??/47) I was in my high school gym watching a group of people roll dice. They were cartoon people - the kind in movie shorts - technicolor. There is an old man with an orange straw hat and a brown loafer jacket - also a colored boy with white teeth, purplish lips, a green turtle neck sweater, with a wool cap to match (orange tassle. Police, in uniform appear. The men pretend to be pitching horseshoes - but the police understand and catch the Negro. They put the orange horseshoes on him for handcuffs - and I realize that the horseshoes are really devises. We all go outside the gym and they do something to the Negro but I can't see what. Interpretation I can't, I wrote this - and no explanation came to mine. I have waited & reread it. The colored boy, for example, I can see his face and he resembles no one. The setting - very unreal - no one belongs. I can only interpret that this is a symbolism which my super ago refuses to recognize. Answers to questions 1. I didn't know anyone. 2. I wanted to see what happened. The colors were very pretty. 3. Onlooker. I wasn't alone - I don't know who, but someone was with me. 4. Pleasant 5. I haven't been in that gym for four years.

Once we were on the less traveled road there were oil cans burning as danger signals. The road we were on is quite well known - to me - about a mile from home. It seems to me: I reaiize that I am risking something by going out with J. Although I am absolutely in charge of the situation (I was driving) and capable of steering away from danger signs, I realize this is not a good road. (He kisses me - it's pleasant - we, neither of us pretends - I don't love him but I like to have him kiss me. Consciously I believe that this is satisfactory behavior by my standards but not by those of, say, my sister). You know what happens when you meet somebody on a secondary road under construction! Crash! I'm afraid that will happen if the boy I date finds out. Interpretation None Answers to questions 1. J. is 24 - I confide in him, etc. 2. Pleasantly close to danger- like a roller coaster 3.

"0311"	"None"	"(Code 043, Age 21, 09/??/47) My father took me to a large department store; it was late and the store was quite empty. As I walked to our car to put part of the present into the trunk compartment (conveniently located on a high floor of the building - no?) - an old stooped lady reached to take some of my present. She failed to grasp it, but nevertheless I pursued her less she try again. We ran across a wine rug - she tried to trick me by dodging thru narrow doorways and behind chairs. Eventually she disappeared. I was pleased for she was gone for the time being. I returned. D. (who seems to me to have insight into people's actions - my father has no knowledge of him) was helping Father get lunch from the car. He tasted two milk bottles (with straws). They were sour; he discarded them. Father had also brought me a brand new camera with an expensive television attachment. Interpretation I wrote this on other paper as soon as I awakened. It is in my recopying that I have guessed a meaning. I feel that my mother resents my affection for my father, and the feeling he has for me. Therefore I think it is she who is the old woman trying to snatch away the present - sign of his regard for me. And I realize, I guess that this menace can only be silenced temporarily. With my first copy I guessed that - D. saw the milk (my mother - no?) and rejected it (her) because it would be harmful. The camera was doubtless to satisfy jealous urges for my two roommates - both have cameras with flash attachments. Answers to questions 1. The old lady was feeble - therefore I could not harm her. (Honor thy father....) 2. I was glad to pursue her - to take some direct action. I was pleased with the toy & camera. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. She avoided my father - so he would not know her plan. (He did not know I followed her). 6. No. However - my mother annoys me - this finds expression - but not in the same dream repeated. 7."

I remember someone saying ""How nice for them to be together!"" Interpretation This remark seems wild. I never (consciously at least) wanted to date him. I think I was unconsciously striving to associate myself with a boy which my fanily knows and approves of. - A good home-town type - you know. My parents disapprove of a man at school whom I like - because of the very difference between him and anyone who could conceivably live in the restricted little viIlage we do. Answers to questions 2.

"0313"	"None"	"(Code 043, Age 21, 09/??/47) That my roommate confided in me that during the summer she met A. - he was searching for me and seeing her instead, he captured her. (Wearing a long black cape, he choked her and carried her away.) He confined her for the summer in his harem (He is a Moslem) where she was cruelly treated and given only ice cream to eat. He had many women & their boy children in this low ceilinged structure (the harem) and periodically went on forays for more captives. My roommate learned to love A. and since she was jealous of his love for me - she told me of the summer to arouse my jealousy. I accepted the recital, quite calmly. Interpretation He is to me foreign. From another country etc. etc. he is very much the opposite of anyone I have known or understood. Being a high caste Moslem - he is entitled to more than one wife at a time. He is exceedingly attractive; I have always imagined that he has at least had opportunities to seduce other women. Ice cream was something we always ate together. This seems to strengthen the theme that my roommate was a substitute. The low ceilings - I am rather tall - he does not like me to wear high heels. Also - they give the set-up a more furtive atmosphere. Her jealousy would of course give me pride and satisfaction. I crave approval. Answers to questions 2. I accepted my roommates tale because the reality seemed less difficult to face than the doubts I have heretofore endured. 3. Onlooker 4. Neither 5. It looked the way I would imagine a harem. It was not particularly clean. (I guess I associate cleanliness and purity). 6. No. 7."

She never did; I swam - kept busy- G. finally appeared - and took me back. (G. is the type person you cultivate because he sustains your pride-ego-self satisfaction. He convinces me I'm wonderful. I haven't seen him for a while - 90 he came in a dream & said the same things). Interpretation The three of us were at a camp for crippled children two summers ago. I. & I were in charge of eight little girls. I never did any of her work except swimming instruction. My pride is reinforced by G.'s reminders, whenever I see him, that I ""did all the work."" I had just seen I. - she is being married. I envy her that - and this dream made me feel, I guess, that, after all, I am ""better"" than she is, anyway. Answers to questions 2. I didn't mind doing the work at camp. - and the motivation of praise made it more enjoyable. When G. came, he accused I. of deserting me - distinctly pleasurable. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant. I don't mind the idea of being alone. I could have found my way back. I just enjoyed being dependent on G. for help. 5. The lake is like one we drove past this summer - completely hemmed in by trees. 6. No. 7. Dark green trees - firs? G.'s orange swimming trunks. (I never saw any such - this is imagination)."

Sex of Jo never came up again). came to swim where I was sunbathing. It was on a large rock in a lake in Canada. (I spent my vacation at such a place). Girl said she would take me to R. (I want to go there - to see a girl who ""jilted"" one of my best friends). Girl told me about mauve, long spined animal who might try to eat us if it saw us bathing there. I was amused. They (Girl & Jo) were terrified when it appeared and slid under a ledge. THIS CONTINUES IN MY NEXT SHEET--THEY AREN'T THE SAME DREAM, QUITE--YET THEY'RE CONNECTED. Interpretation The animal didn't frighten me at first. I was secure in the warm (SUN). But when girl started to abandon the warmth, for a cold ledge and safety, I came too. If this warmth signifies sexual pleasure, I will bask in it until other people say that cold safety is preferable. Then I am forced to abandon my pleasure and assume the attitude (of fear, which I say is ""beneath me"", as a protective device. I say ""oh the animal will hurt me - I must flee"" and thus project on to this animal my own fears of myself. I forgot to tell you that the ledge was so confining - while wide - there was barely enough height for me to lie flat - certainly none to spare. obvious isn't it? Answers to questions 2.

The floors were quite polished. The ""animal"" was now an ape. He tried to snatch my feet from under the bed and eat them. He left periodically, and I was able to ""boost"" my companions through the window to safety. He came back and closed the window so it would be harder for me to get out. Ape left and returned with friend who was a man. They decided to let me get away. I woke up. Interpretation It was a low built bed. There were springs in my face. The neat shiny house - my home. My mother is fanatic about cleanliness (I know - anal sublimation - but she does it anyway). Natch, that I want to escape from home - The animal is eventually close to a man - because it seems that only marriage will really free me from home (and that is only a degree of freedom, huh?) Oh, my feet! They are enormous! I realize that so far I have been able to help people - but for myself - I must go alone. If the ape is my father - he knows I can get through the window, but he is not above putting obstacles in my way. (See, in the end he yields).

There were white ruffled curtains - my mother's passion - and braided rugs - we have dozens. (Yet - it wasn't any actual room in our house. I confess - sublimation) 6. No. 7.

Since it is a ""300"" course, I could not understand the young girls; I was very resentful. I had the feeling inside me - I hope there has been an error and we can revert to the original. Interpretation Is it that I so resent the freshman girl in my dormitory - who is trying her best to date a fellow (J.) I date? Even though I date other people (the entering men) do I begrudge losing anything I consider mine? (J.) I interpret that I have a very selfish desire to keep J. and the method I shall use is to convince him that she is too young.

I remembered it was 11:30 at night and I had to be in at 1. So I didn't think this was quite like the man as I knew him - so I went inside. Interpretation I realized, I think, thru this medium - my answer to the queqtion of, ""should these two get married?"" It has seemed to me that their relationship lacked something.

It was all exotic colors - no plain blues or yellows - but magenta & chartreuse & aqua - I watched a merry-go-round - all dazzling & glittering. I seemed to be far off and seeing - just enjoying watching - and not darinng to go closer. Interpretation I see this as being my cynical skeptical point of view. I did not dare go too close - I was all alone and I was afraid that if I saw too clearly - the beauty would vanish. Instead I knew (and I realize now that this is my customary attitude) that the really exotic world melt upon inspection. Also, I see all this in another light. I have the habit of tearing down the idealistic and the consequent disappointment when the materialistic is less appealing (in that is has lost its glamour) I have in the last few days, lost my credulity of the charm of a particular love affar - I know that it wasn't the romantic interlude that I made it be in my mind - I can now realize that he didn't love me as I would like to believe - and I feel wistful that it can't be the sequined violet & carmine story I liked.

Then Father came, I forgot I.'s name; Father had on his bifocals and seemed to be squinting. Finally, desperately, his name came. The scene closed abruptly. Interpretation I had difficulty explaining I. at all - even to my roommates. He is not the type of person to be subtle about - and I don't care to tell my parent about his realism. The red love seat is of course interesting since the color is the only nice thing about it. It's quite uncomfortable.

Buildings were still protruding thru the cement, a white church steeple and the ridge pole of a garage. In addition, the wind was blowing, and so the cement was too uneven to skate on. Interpretation I think that I am hinting to myself what ""the future has in store for me."" I have freedom of movement in the boat - but I crave the security of firmer ground - so I try to make this water firmer - thru plaster of Paris. When I can & do get what I am seeking - that security - it may be firmer than I wish - already formed, wlth the irrevocable ridges that the wind made - and the other sides of my personality as hopelessly enmashed as the church & garage. Currently I am considering marriage - but I am afraid of the independence I needs surrender. A girl in my dorm was working with Plaster of Paris that night. Answers to questions 1.

One girl and I were going to the dorm when I suddenly realized that I hadn't seen my date all evening. I was lost - afraid - lonely.

The little girl wanted me to come & play but I couldn't because a fellow I date was upstairs in the bathroom, and I was waiting for him. Finally fellow came down - he had become someone else.* He came in, grasping neighbor's hand, & her father's hand, firmly. From then on he seems to wander, being either L. or P. without much discrimination. The little blonde girl & her sister & 2 brothers are going to a party, and leave, all bundled up. They all disappear - trouping into the fraternity house across the street - blonde leading. Interpretation I like two men - one is my childhood sweetheart, a member of the fraternity mentioned - the other is a stranger - someone who must be endlessly introduced. Bread - the symbol of life - of ""My body"" - I am tearing up while I sit waiting. The little girl wants to play - but instead must go on a date - desire to regress? The firm handshake & its meanings were recently discussed by my friends. ""Firm"" is a good sign.

En route home, this friend, who does not resemble anyone I know became quite amorous, frightening me. I finally got back to the dorm; came in a door (which actually does not exist - seemed to be cut through the wall). Interpretation This dream occurred right after I had been to a dance - my date had a headache. My date has a very charming & attractive friend - and it was not until I rewrote this on this sheet of paper (copying it from the record I made at the time) that I knew it is he.

The drums were against the wall - so I turned my back on everyone & began to play. I am absolutely ignorant of drum playing technique. I tried each drum and then I just hit them in a rhythm which was good. I leaned back, satisfied, and reaching for a cigarette - got the pipe which I saw ""owner of the drums"" smoking yesterday. I took a drag, not realizing; it tasted good. Friend of ""owner of drums"" - stranger - appeared. He liked the way I played the drums. We had conversation which seemed quite clever, but slips my mind. He could play the drums & showed me how. Interpretation Owner of the drums goes to C. - yet has wonderful musical & social talents. He seems quite unhappy. He therefore comes to H. to be appreciated. and I suppose a reason I like him is that I would like to identify myself with his musical ability. I turned my back on the audience. People comment on my (real, not imagined) lack of musical ability. But one man heard me - and appreciated me - laughed with my that I was smoking the pipe - made clever conversation - is an optimistic sign. Answers to questions 1. Fellows - slightly older than I 2.

"0329"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, ??/??/46) While at camp last summer, I had a recurrent dream that I would forget my mother's birthday, which would occur while I was away from home, and for which I would not be able to get home. In one of these dreams I had forgotten to call or write greetings for her birthday, and when I returned home found she had died. My father, to console himself, was reading ""The Bird's Xmas Carol."" I took the book from him, to read it myself. In the manner of dreams, however, I read ahead of the print, and it was meaningless. I had a feeling of great remorse at my mother's death, and felt a stronger love for her than I had ever known while she was alive. The dream left a strong impression, and even now, when I think of it, experience a feeling of great tenderness toward my mother. Interpretation I do not know why I worried in my dream about forgetting my mother's birthday, for I had looked forward for several weeks to calling her and talking to her. The ""Bird's Xmas Carol"" reminded me of a similar incident that happened when I was ten and in the 5th grade, our teacher, just before Christmas vacation, read the story to our class, and while she read it, I experienced the same feeling of love and tenderness toward my mother. I remember running home from school at lunch time to see if she were all right. Answers to questions 2. Sadness 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Not the same dream precisely, but similar dreams with the same basic problem."
"0330"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, ??/??/46) I was floating in Lake Erie, and although I did not recognize the site, I had this firm conviction it was off 72nd street. As I floated further out, the land took on the appearance of the Shore Drive, except that it ran diagonally from 72nd St. to E. 9th, which seemed a great deal further inland than it actually is. I drifted farther out with apparent unconcern until I noticed the water was becoming scummy and filled with debris. I then became alarmed and thrashed around in the water, but became tired quickly and ceased to struggle, continuing to float. Interpretation Evidently the floating indicates a feeling of security, and the momentary struggle indicates grappling with the cause of the feeling of insecurity, which in this dream was represented by the floating debris. The floating sensation in itself, however, was most pleasant. Answers to questions 2. Contentment while floating, repugnance at seeing debris, momentary alarm while fighting debris, and resignation when finding out struggling is useless. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. No 6. No"
"0331"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 02/??/47) This dream was a series of disconnected events, and through its entirety I was strongly aware that I was engaged, and kept constantly twisting my diamond ring around my finger with the thumb of the same hand. I watched my fiance greet a friend of his by shaking his hand and pounding his friend's hand exuberantly. As a gift, he brought me an expensive pair of eye glass frames in an elaborate glass-case, instead of merely having the frames adjusted, as I had requested. On another occasion, I was sitting on a narrow steel bar about six feet above the ground, discussing my engagement with several friends below me. They later, to my bewilderment, claimed to have known nothing about it, but when I mentioned his name, their enthusiastic replies were how lucky it was that my fiance did not have flat feet! Interpretation This dream, I am sure, is a natural result of a tired, active mind as it works during sleep. There was no organization and comparatively little imagination in it--it is only a slight elaboration and pictorialization of thoughts that had come to my mind during the day. Almost all the details can be matched to actual trends of thought. Outside factors had probably made themselves felt; the engagement ring in the dream was actually a ring I had found during that day which I had believed lost and which I wore to bed. Perhaps my dream-act of sitting on the steel bar above my friends, however, was a subconscious feeling of superiority to them. The only person in the dream whom I can actually identify was a friend whom I had seen to talk to that day for the first time in several months. And my fiance, in my dream, was actually a boy whom I had known for several weeks a year or so previously, and had not thought of since that time. Answers to questions 2. There was really a lack of emotion during the dream; apathy would probably best describe how I felt. 3. Participant 4. Absolutely neither. It made me neither happy nor unhappy. 5. No. 6. No."
"0332"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 02/??/47) Two girl friends and myself, dressed in bathing suits, entered Hotel C. by the Public Square entrance, and crowded into a self-operated elevator to go to the 10th floor. There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia. The swimming pool was in amphitheatre arrangement, with tiers of seats that sloped down to the pool itself. The water, however, looked heavy and thick, and was of a deep blue-green black color, altogether unpleasant. Ahead of my friends, I went down the right aisle to the pool. I started to dive in, but a scream from my friends stopped me; they explained to me that there were five baby pigs at the end of the pool. To get to the other side, it was necessary to go back up the step-aisle and pass in front of the spectators scattered around the ""theatre."" Among them were several boys of my own age, who guffawed loudly at the mistake I had made. With heavy sarcasm and some anger I ""fraw hawed"" back at them. When I had passed, I had the uneasy feeling that they must have thought I was crazy. At the left end I dived into the pool, and to be sure I did not encounter the pigs, followed a girl in a yellow bathing suit who was swimming in front of me. The pool was divided into several sections by what resembled a clothes rope. I continually entangled myself in these ropes as I tried to swim over them. At this point of the dream I learned that the little pigs were a part of a game provided by the management for its guests; if somebody swam into or near the ""pig pen,"" the crib arrangement in which they were kept would overturn and they would be at freedom in the pool, and swimmers in turn, would be forced to use the pigs' former crib if they did not want to swim with the pigs. Interpretation This dream followed a whole day of intensive study with out a break. I still had not finished my work, however and as I went to bed I worried about finishing it. This may have some bearing on the dream. The swimming I believe hinges on the fact that twice a week, for an hour or so, I swim at the C. Club. There is a self-operated elevator there, which also has a tendency to get stuck. The incident of being ridiculed by the boys, I imagine, is my fear of that very thing. The amphitheatre arrangement may be explained by the fact that I have lately been a spectator myself at several swim meets, looking down from the side to the pool. Answers to questions 2. Embarrassment, fear, perplexity 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. No 6. Yes - of the color of the water and clothing."
"0333"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 03/??/47) It was an especially bleak day and I was walking with a friend of mine (girl) along the path around W Park Lagoon. I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend. Interpretation To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured. This dream recalled the incident to my mind after having forgotten about it for several years. Answers to questions 2. Surprise and horror at having injured my friend; fear of results. 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. No 6. No, except to be conscious of bleakness of day and surroundings."
"0334"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 03/??/47) This is a dream which I believe I have had, in some form or another, at another time; I experienced the ""This is where I came in"" feeling throughout it. Several girl friends and myself were driving home from downtown. I was sitting on somebody's lap and feeling in good spirits; one of the girls, however, was sound asleep, her head resting against a window. The home at which we arrived was at the top of a hill on a very wooded, mountainous section of Virginia. I was standing on the porch (complete with white pillars) and there was a young soldier with me. I had the feeling he was one of the ""test tube"" soldiers of Ft. Knox; he was very young and wearing a clean, well-pressed uniform, and had red hair. I believe we were waiting for breakfast. He said something to me, and we went to the back of the house. It seems he has wanted to burn rubbish, but the fire had spread to the whole hill, and to hills beyond. There was a great deal of smoke in the air, but I could see no fire. We returned to the house. In the front center hall, when we entered, was a discussion as to what to do. A woman evidently the owner, decided to open the paddock to free the horses, so somebody, with several dogs, set them free. In the next action I was a spectator, and the dream took on a motion-picture semblance. The horses were fleeing wildly, and there were several palaminoes I noticed especially. Interpretation All I can really explain is about the soldier and the fire. I had read several articles at that time of the Fort Knox experiment, which interested me. The fire, I believe, is more important. When I was much younger I used to have nightmares about fire, always in our own home. A fire would start in our attic, I would dream, and sweep thru the house, destroying everything. This fear of fire I can trace to two sources: first, that my father often became angry with me when he found my toys strewn about the attic, and he often mentioned the possibility of fire. Secondly, for many years our house was next to a wooded, grassy field where field fires in dry summer were a potential danger. My childhood dreams of a fire were very vivid and terrifying and on at least one occasion I got out of bed and went to the attic to see if all was well. I think probably the above dream was that old fear in a new garb. Answers to questions 2. None in particular 3. Both (as defined in dream) 4. Neither 5. Not the exact dream, but others that were similar. I had a feeling of having dreamt or thought of it before. 6. Yes - the whole dream seemed to be in the muted technicolor found in ""popular science"" shorts of movies."
"0335"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/??/47) The dream was a brief one, but caused me a great deal of anxiety. I dreamed it was a Wednesday afternoon, and I was scheduled to attend two things at four o'clock: a water safety course and a sorority meeting. I decided, however, that I wanted to go home and did so. At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting. Even after I awoke, I felt a sense of anxiety over my escapist action. Interpretation Toward the end of every semester I begin to dream of two things; of cutting classes or forgetting to attend them and being penalized for it and of being unable to remember a single thing on the final examination. Actually, I have been faced with the above problem of two important activities scheduled at the same time, and my dream decision of chucking the both by at once and deciding to go home, probably indicates wishful thinking of the same.

"0336"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/??/47) Supposedly next summer, I had returned to the camp where I actually counseled last summer, although it did not in the least resemble that place, but rather my aunt's farm in Virginia, which is in rolling country. There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, ""dry firewood?"" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the ""final banquet,"" a tradition and quite an occasion. I also discovered many sweaters -- sweaters I have had for years, and I was glad to see them, for I was cold and wet. As I stood there, in my slip, I looked down the hill to the road and saw a man in an automobile driving past and staring up at me. It made me quite angry. Interpretation I have been preparing to return to camp this summer, and during the week of this dream had been busy filling out application blanks and writing to counselors I had known there last year. The directyor in the dream has since resigned and been replaced. The feeling of inadequacy with her I had occasionally felt, but it was not a constant feeling. Candles seem to be a source of anxiety--for some reason it seems I am constantly having to get them for occasions; parties, concerts, birthdays, etc., and very often have forgotten them or been unable to buy them. They may have represented a feeling of frustration. Firewood seems to be another frustration symbol, for keeping it dry was of prime importance, and I was often mildly bothered about it at camp, fearing it would get wet and we would be unable to have a fire. Answers to questions 2. Chagrined, angry, embarrassed 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. On a hill, overlooking a road and surrounded by rolling country. 6. No 7. No. In fact, there was a special consciousness of the dreariness of the setting."
"0337"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/??/47) I was walking down a ramp with a strong feeling of having done something of great importance. As I walked along, one woman said to another (although I was not conscious of seeing either) that mine would have made the sixth abdication in a century. I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty. As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried. Interpretation My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave ""I can take it"" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days. The walking down a ramp, which I was sure it was although it more resembled the balcony in my high school gym, is not surprising, for the day before the dream I had ushered at two operas and had been stationed on one of the auditorium ramps. Answers to questions 2. Noble pride, caution, sadness and feeling sorry for myself. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. Ramp of high school gym, rainy street. 6. No 7. No."
"0338"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/??/47) There was a young girl, whom I judged to be about seven years old and whom I felt was a playmate of my sister (although my sister is now sixteen), visiting our house. She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator (""x""). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon. Evidently we made a good job of it, for the little girl thanked me profusely, and mentioned that her older brothers, as well as the two boys who lived upstairs, would certainly admire me for doing such a good job of cleaning! Interpretation The young girl reminded me of a schoolmate I had in the first year or two of elementary school. She had about the same appearance as my dream child, and although I never knew of her home life, I knew she was one of six children. Often I would bring her home from school to have lunch with me, and once I gave her a penny that my ""boy friend"" had given me. (I had not thought of this for years; thinking about the dream brought back these incidents). To clean up a place in such a condition as her home was would probably be my natural tendency to do so; perhaps the dream indicates that I really want to be admired for this tendency. Answers to questions 2. Distaste, accomplishment, need for praise and admiration, pride. 2. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Unknown home 6. No 7. No"
"0339"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 05/??/47) I was standing on our upstairs back porch watching some sort of an air show in the sky. Although it was night, I could see a blimp in its entirety, silver-colored, and a legend or advertisement or news bulletins running around it. I squinted and peered to try to read what it was, but could not. There were several airplanes sky-writing, and doing it in a very graceful sweeps across the sky. I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words. In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm. Interpretation Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the ""dream blimp"" came from. My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says. The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day. And I awakened shortly after the dream to find I had kicked the covers off, which explains my feeling cold in the dream. Answers to questions 2. Mildly perplexed and frustrated at not being able to read the sky-writing 3. Both, really. A participant who was also an onlooker 4. Pleasant 5. The upstairs back porch which is off my bedroom. 6. No 7. I am not sure whether or not the airplane ""smoke"" was colored in the dream, or whether I thought it should be."
"0340"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 05/??/47) I was in a long, rather elaborate corridor which was brilliantly lighted by crystal chandeliers. There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked ""how's O.?"" and I felt surprised that he should know O. I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own. Interpretation In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast. My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure. My surprise at being asked ""how O. was"" springs from the fact that I did not know that my date was not gotten for me by my fraternity friend, but my date was instead a friend of O. O., incidentally, is my ""unrequited."" Answers to questions 2. Passivity except for surprise where indicated in the dream report 2. Participant 4. Neither 5. Given in dream (corridor; living room) 6. No 7. Not colors, but brilliant light from crystal chandeliers."
"0341"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 05/04/47) At a social gathering, seemingly in somebody's attic, I was introduced to a man with whom I danced, a person whom I have seen in school but do not know. At an intermission there was some sort of a program in which three girls, dressed in formal gowns, sang, sitting down. They were quite informal about it, giggling and glancing about as they sang. One girl I vaguely know as being in one of my classes, was wearing a yellow formal--the only color in the dream. One of the girls has moved recently to California (the two vaguely physically resemble one another). On the other side of the trio, still another girl (B) got up and left, saying she felt embarrassed because her skirt was too short. The couple with whom my partner and I were evidently double-dating, was a high school friend of mine who has since married and whom I have not seen since her wedding. As we drove home from the dance my dancing partner changes to a youth whom I have never seen. As he left me at my door in broad daylight, he hastily shook my hand, as I opened the door, and left. My mother was awaiting me at the top of the stairs. Interpretation On the day of this dream I had looked forward to a call from the fellow with whom I have gone rather steadily for several months, realizing that if I did not hear from him, I would probably not see him again. As he did not call, I began to search about in my mind for someone to take to a forthcoming dance. Probably in my dream, I was continuing to do the same thing. My dancing partner, although I do not actually know his marital status, probably in that he was married during the dream, represents some sort of a guilt feeling. Answers to questions 2. No particular feelings; I seemed to be rather passive about everything that went on. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Attic automobile the side door of my house 6. No 7. Only one colored object; the yellow formal gown mentioned in the dream."
"0342"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 19, 06/??/47) My brother's wife (4 yrs. my senior) was in some way going to hurt my 25 yr. old brother M. I became very angry and threatened to kill her. The anger in my dream was very intense. Interpretation Mother is rather prejudiced and has told me some things that E. has done which our family considers wrong such as disrespect, etc. In my dreams I must have magnified these wrongs till I made up something big. Answers to questions 2. Intensely angry 3. Actual Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. No where 6. No 7. No colors"
"0343"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 19, 02/10/48) I had been married two days and, at the time, was cleaning a house which I did not recognize as any I had ever been in before, but one in which I felt perfectly comfortable. My mother was directing me, as she does at home, and I was working vigorously. I had no idea, at this time, of anyone else in my family, such as Dad or my 2 older brothers. I hadn't seen my husband for 2 days, but I felt that I could make it up to him and I was determined to try. Interpretation The idea of marriage has been mentioned frequently in my dorm; and, I remember we were discussing its possibilities the night before. Mother's position in my dream was probably due to the fact I know she doesn't want me to marry till I'm through college. Answers to questions 2. Happy 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. An unknown house 6. No 7. No color"
"0344"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 19, 02/17/48) I was on a desert with a group of people. Although I knew the people were there, they seemed like phantoms because I could not recognize them. One girl (I couldn't recognize her) and I went dashing around on the sand, having a gay carefree time. Another girl (who I couldn't recognize) tried hard to annoy me, and she made me angry for which I rebuked her. Interpretation I had played a basketball game the night before and my guard kept annoying me in a rather unethical way, according to basketball rules. I held my temper, and I realize now, after the dream, that I was really very angry but didn't feel I should do or say anything at that time. Answers to questions 2. Anger 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Desert 6. No! 7. Yes, there was color! Brown, beige."
"0345"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 19, 02/18/48) I dreamed I was on the shore of a small lake with a hill rising about ten feet in back of me. A girl was with me and one I did know. A ""C.B."" type of plane was stunting over the water and headed straight towards the girl and I. I was afraid and ran to the hill and back against it, but my friend was not afraid and she stayed by the shore; the plane zoomed up just in time to miss the hill. Then the plane landed and two men, rather good looking but none I'd seen before, stepped from the plane into a small boat and rowed towards us. Next scene we were in a hotel and they were there--here I woke up. Interpretation I can think of no reason to dream this other than the fact I ate some cheese just before retiring, which has been the cause of some peculiar dreams before. I am interested in flying and the C.B. is my favorite type plane. Answers to questions 2. Fear, quisical 3. Participant 4. Both 5. A small lake 6. No! 7. Red, yellow predominately. All others as called for by the situation."
"0346"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 19, 02/28/48) I was attending a dance and I have no recollection of having known my date, yet I know I arrived at the dance with one. The impression I remember is my being the center of attraction of all the dancing couples, standing in the middle of floor drinking bottle after bottle of soda pop. The dream had the aspect of a Hollywood operetta with lavish surroundings. Interpretation The night of the dream I had been to a fraternity party where we drank a new type of drink called ""Smile."" Many jokes were made and that must have made an impression of drinking on my mind. We did dance quite a bit, which correlated with the dream. Answers to questions 2. Bubbling over with happiness 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. A large ballroom unknown to me 6. No! 7. Yes. White chrystal-like color of my dress and reds and black"
"0347"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 03/05/48) I dreamed I had been walking for hours, but I wasn't tired. The scenery never seemed to change; it was always the same large homes, unkept and musty. I wanted desperately to find some other scenery, but mile after mile showed the same result. I could see myself, too, during the dream and although I was anxious inwardly my face was calm and showed no emotion. Interpretation I have just had a perplexing problem brought before me, and when I need to forget about something or get my mind off my worries, I walk. In a round about way I guess I was trying to forget my troubles. Answers to questions 2. Anxious inwardly, calm outwardly 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Street 6. No! 7. No"
"0348"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 03/07/48) I dreamed I was floating on air along one of the streets surrounding the school. My feet would glide evenly above the ground at about 10 feet and people walking with me were laughing as if I were doing some hilariously funny stunt. I was laughing also. Interpretation I lost the heel of my pump running home one night and I was terribly embarrassed. I can't think of any other reason for the dream. Answers to questions 2. Happy 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. A street in Cleveland 6. No! 7. No"
"0349"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 03/11/48) I dreamed I was at a huge party in some palacial ballroom that I have never seen before. The party seemed to be in my honor and I stood out in the crowds of people as if spotlights were playing on me at all times. No one came near me for there was a circle of about 15 feet where no one stood, about me and yet I was vastly happy. It reminded me of a scene in Il Trovadore during the duet. Interpretation I have had a birthday recently and the girls in the dorm gave me a wonderful party which was a great surprise to me. This brought on the idea for the dream and the scene from Il Trovadore is one I like very much. Answers to questions 2. Happy 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. Ballroom 6. No! 7. No"
"0350"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/03/48) I was playing tennis and there seems to have been a match for championship involved. I was playing hard and enjoying it, but I found, to my amazement, that every time the ball hit the racquet, it would go through the strings. I was extremely perplexed, yet no one else seemed to have thought it odd or unnatural. Interpretation I realize that spring sports beginning could influence me to dream of playing tennis, but the rest is a complete mystery. Answers to questions 2. Happy, then frustrated 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Tennis court 6. No! 7. No!"
"0351"	"None"	"(Code 025, Age 20, 04/??/48) I was at a beach party with many people I knew, yet I felt lonely because the fellow I had come with had gone back to the car for something forgotten. It was a very black night with a haze over the water about 1/4 of a mile out. I wanted to swim into the haze and I knew I was a good enough swimmer to do it, but I was afraid of what was beyond the haze. I swam out to it and forced myself to go into it. It covered me like a blanket and I quickly returned to shore really afraid. Interpretation I like to swim and in the water I like to go far and it pleases me to make other people get mad or anxious by doing this. I know I'm a good enough swimmer not to drown and it's one silly way of getting attention; but more than that, I personally feel I've accomplished something by swimming a great distance than I have a slight fear of drowning. Answers to questions 2. Fear 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. A beach 6. No! 7. No!"
"0352"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/16/48) I dreamed I was dancing at a ballroom I have been to and that I was having a wonderful time. All of a sudden, practically all of the people I have met in the last year within a certain crowd came in. Then I became panicky for the fellow I was dancing with, was not the boy this crowd knew that I went with. I was terribly afraid someone would tell the other fellow I was unfaithful. I felt trapped, as if I was trying desperately to escape from an enclosure of steel. Interpretation Lately, I have been discussing the merits of ""going steady,"" ""being pinned,"" and ""married"" with my roommates, boy friend (I hate those two words) and mother. If I went by dreams, I guess I shouldn't consent to go steady for I seem to figure it to be a restriction. Answers to questions 2. Happy, terrified 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Ballroom I knew 6. No! 7. No!"
"0353"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/18/48) I dreamed my date and I were in the back seat of a car while friends of ours, another couple my same age were driving recklessly fast to make the one o'clock deadline at the dorm. Usually, I'm secretly afraid of going at high speeds--even when I drive. But in the dream, I laughed at our recklessness although everyone else was silent. Interpretation This actually happened. Friends were driving me back to the dorm to make the one o'clock deadline. Naturally, I was very embarrassed at having them put to so much inconvenience. In the dream, I was feeling the disgust I felt they were thinking of me at the time of driving home. Answers to questions 2. Anxious, unhappy 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. Car 6. No! 7. No!"
"0354"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/28/48) I dreamed I was attending a concert at a place resembling the interior of the Hama. I was enthralled by the music which was strictly classical and had more volume than melody, yet the piece was not heavy. I was conscious of the others in the audience, but of no other single person. The music was extremely vivid, but I canlt remember the time and I don't believe I have ever heard the piece before. I had a feeling the concert lasted a long time. Interpretation I had been to the Hama Theater that night, but saw a play. The setting is perfectly logical, but why I dreamed the concert was playing, I can't figure out. Answers to questions 2. Enthralled 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5. Hama Theater 6. I have dreamed of music before, yes. 7. No. Dark colors"
"0355"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 04/30/48) There was music playing nearby a swimming pool, in which I was bathing. At first, the pool was surrounded with trees, but these trees turned into people, and I was in a show or aquacade diving and swimming and laughing all the time. I must have been having a wonderful time. The water was silvery blue and the moon and stars were out, yet everyone could see us very plainly. Interpretation I have swum in a water follies and, hearing of the performance at the Arena, must have recalled the sensation. Answers to questions 2. Extremely happy 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5.

"0356"	"None"	"(Code 045, Age 20, 05/01/48) I dreamed I was with a crowd of school girls getting in a bus. Just then a very tall man came up in back of me and tried to pick me up. I got on the bus just in time before he could catch me, although I don't remember him chasing me. All at once, we were driving down Lake Avenue in front of my house and I felt if I could just get off here at my house I would be safe. Interpretation I can think of no other reason for the dream except that I live at B. off campus and we continually warned not to go any place alone and not to walk in certain places.

I had such a good time, that the feeling of anxiety I felt, I thought was due to the excitement. Then I saw a fellow I had dated before. I didn't want him to see me. I still like this fellow but in the dream I wished he wouldn't know I was there. For the rest of the evening I tried to keep behind things or far enough away so he couldn't see me.

We began to argue and I felt very big like a mountain looming over a valley. My mother is shorter than I but not very much so. I saw her face turn red as she shouted at me and her hair all flung about her face. I don't know what we were arguing about, but this picture of my mother stuck with me vividly.

Although I wanted to be married, I felt I was going against something or somebody. I felt guilty. Then suddenly my father tried to choke me to death. He was very composed. He showed no emotion while choking me. I wasn't afraid of death, but of my father. To be a little clearer, I was more afraid of having made my father angry, then being killed myself. Interpretation I have no immediate desire to get married because I know Dad and Mom would like me to finish college.

Unseen, I left the dinner party and walked out the front door of Dr. Bacon's house at the P. Andy, a fellow I had dated came walking up the driveway smiling. Even though I knew he could help me, I walked around the house away from him. Interpretation I had been to a dinner party the night before and had a wonderful time.

"0366"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/06/4?) I dreamed that J---(M 22--engaged to me) and I went to visit two of our friends who were just married. They were living in an old house similar to one I visited when a child. G--- (M 23)was sitting in the living room and there were two huge rats sitting in front of the fire place. I said something to M--- L--- (F 23) about the house and she said ""you should have seen it before we moved in. Then one of the rats jumped into G---'s lap. Interpretation The dream probably grew out of a letter I had just received from M--- L---. I am not too fond of G--- and I guess I class him with big ugly rats. The statement made by L--- is typical of the way she always stands behind anything G--- does. I can not place the house but it seems to recall unpleasant memories. Answers to questions 2. I was sad throughout the dream 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. An old house 6. No 7. No"
"0367"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/09/4?) I dreamed that my Father(62) became ill and J--- (M 22) and I had to go to C--- and bring him home. He was not very sick so we decided to take a vacation on the way home. We went to N Y--- (hardly on the way home) and bought a hat for mother. Interpretation My dream was on the wish that my Father would come home and that we could all take a vacation together. The only pleasant trip I ever remember taking with Father and Mother was once to C--- and Mother bought a hat which might explain the hat in my dream. Answers to questions 2. I was happy in the dream 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. A hotel and a hat store 6. No 7. No"
"0368"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 21, 07/02/4?) J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up. Interpretation The women with their heads cut off probably gained entrance into my dream by the plate in my art book of the statue of the three fates. The fire crackers at E--- Beach came from my memory of the times my parents used to take me there on the Fourth of July. The young people were probably just the wish to meet more young people. Answers to questions 2. I was afraid of the older women but excited at the park and happy with the other kids. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. Our living room. E--- Beach and the car. 6. No 7.

"0369"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/13/4?) I dreamed I was back in H--- with J--- (M 22). I went into the K--- house and saw all the girls eating dinner. The house seemed perfect and the dream was very real. There was a message in my room to call Dr. T--- because he wanted my reports on my leadership group. I went down into the trunk room to look for the reports and found them in a trunk. Suddenly several of the girls were down there with me and we were studying for a psychology test. Interpretation My H. year book arrived in the afternoon. I was thinking when I went to bed about how nice it could be to go back for my diploma over a week-end so I could see all the people who had not graduated. Often on Sunday evenings after ten thirty we studied our psychology in the trunk room. Answers to questions 2"
"0370"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/17/4?) I dreamed I was going down town. I put my wallet in my bag and noticed that I had three dollar bills. I met the mail man and he gave me a letter containing twenty one dollar bills. My wallet was so thick that I could not fold it so I put the money in the change purse. Interpretation Before I went to bed I gave mother some money I owed her and we had a very difficult time coming out even. I was thinking when I went to sleep about how nice it would be to be working and earn my own money. When I worked at H. Bros I earned about twenty dollars and it came in an envelope.

"0371"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/19/4?) I dreamed I was riding my bike up a steep hill. The path I was following became very narrow and then suddenly my bike fell over the cliff and I started to loose my balance. When I awoke I was trying to grab something to hold on to. Interpretation I believe this dream represents the conflict between growing up and remaining young. I had seen a bike in the afternoon and thought how much fun it would be to ride around the block on it again. I do not know what kind of security I was trying to grab but it was probably something like a permanent job. Answers to questions 2. I was anxious and worried in the dream 3. Actual participant 4.

"0372"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 21, 06/23/4?) I dreamed I was in the room of an old house which over looked a wide river. The river was very high almost to the edge of the wide windows facing the water. I went out of the house and got into a boat and sailed back and forth in front of the wide windows. Suddenly there was thunder and rain. The house melted away. The woman who owned the house--(the mother of one of my friends) drove her car to the river's edge and I got in. There was another clap of thunder and I awoke. Interpretation The setting of the dream probably originated from the pictures of some of Frank Lloyd Wright's houses which I had been looking at before I went to bed. The mother of my friend probably originated in my dream because while at school I saw the plans of a building designed by Wright whlch they have bought and are planning to build soon. The thunder was probably the sound of the truck backing into our drive just before I awoke. Answers to questions 2. First I was happy and then surprised. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5.

"0373"	"None"	"(Code 048, Age 22, 07/27/4?) I dreamed I was in a dlfferent city with J. and his sister (F 35). I was buying formals and was wearing my hair piled up on my head. The formal I liked the best was a white lace dress with long sleeves. Interpretation I was rather angry with myself when I went to bed and I believe the dream was the wish to be a different person (clothes make the woman idea). The white dress may also have been symbolic of a wedding dress and the desire to get married. Answers to questions 2. It was a happy dream 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. A large city 6. No 7.

In my dream I was trying to buy colored blocks to fit into a wall panel I was able to buy and fit all the blocks except one with out which the whole design would fall apart. Interpretation The general plan of the dream may have come from the difficulty I have had working with the panel in a radio cabinet J. and I are building or a game of chinese checkers I played before going to bed. The one block that wouldn't fit was probably an expression of an Id impulse against the formal design. Answers to questions 2. The dream was frustrating 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5.

"0375"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 09/25/47) I was in a foreign land living in a strange house with a very blonde girl. All of my friends seemed to live in this country too. There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset. Another elderly man had also given blood for my dog although the animal was not expected to live. (My uncle has been dead for about 8 years and he was about 71 when he died. He was not a blood relative, but lived for years with my mother's family and I always called him Uncle. He was very kind to me. The other elderly gentleman I cannot identify. My dog has been dead about 1-1/2 years and was 12 years old when he died. I cannot identify the blonde girl, but She was my age in the dream. My fiance is 23 years old.) Interpretation My fiance is away at school which may account for the foreign place. I may fear subconsciously, that he will be taken from me by another girl--symbolized by his death and my stolen potatoe chips, which in reality I like to eat. Perhaps I look on my mother as a bearer of bad news who adds one trouble to one already established. Answers to questions 2. I felt anger towards the girl, frustration upon the death of my fiance and I was anxious over my dog's illness. 3. Both--I could see myself & yet I felt I was doing the acting. 4. Unpleasant 5. A foreign place. I was at times in a strange house (where I was living) and other times I was on the street. 6. No 7. No"
"0376"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 09/25/47) This is only a snatch of a dream. I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance. He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on. Interpretation In reality I probably miss the attentions of my fiance who is away at school and in order to stick to my principles I disguise any cravings in my dream in the form of an attack under very repulsive conditions. The people therefore seem to see me with my fiance and don't think anything is wrong. I have always disliked dime stores intensely since I worked in one a few times, and this setting also adds to my fear and distaste. Answers to questions 2. I was frightened and anxious because I could not attract anyone's attention. They were oblivious to my plight. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. A familiar street 6. No 7. No"
"0377"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 10/07/47) I dreamed I was in a Speech Class at M--- and the girl in front of me kept fidgeting & told the teacher not to call on her as she was too nervous. Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, ""Christmas"" and ""Easter"" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing & went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls & fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, & she kept talking continuously & seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, & I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.) Interpretation Perhaps this dream is concerned with my classes, for the day before I had the dream, I had a speech class & was told I was to prepare a speech for the next meeting. I do not like to make speeches. In another class we elected class officers, and I felt like it was extremely unnecessary to do it in college. As to the rest of the dream I can see no significance unless perhaps I feel I am being held back from being in a group by someone represented by the woman talking to me on the phone. Answers to questions 2. I was perplexed over the election, and I felt anxious while talking on the phone for I wanted to get back to the group. 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. First I was in a classroom at M---, then on an unidentified beach, & finally in a strange bedroom. 6. No 7. I could see red roses in the bedroom wallpaper."
"0378"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 10/08/47) I dreamed I was in a very small general store with my fiance. In came the brother of a fellow I used to go with before I met my fiance. The brother is about 14 years old now, but he seemed older in the dream. He showed me some money he had gotten on a trip. It was foreign money, and I felt it came from some island in the South Seas. The name on it was something like Madeira. This brother told me that P--- his brother was home now. Interpretation This dream may have been caused by the fact that the college where my ex-boyfriend is a student was coming to C--- for a football game, & I thought perhaps the fellow would also be in town to see the game. Answers to questions 2. I felt happy to see the boy for I hadn't seen him in sometime. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. A general store with a big pot bellied stove in it. I had never seen it before. 6. No 7. No"
"0379"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 10/10/47) My fiance asked me if I minded going to the same restaurant again for dinner. I said it was all right with me. We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the ""L--- F---"" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in & sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he & a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish ""I wish I could go."" I kept saying ""Quiero _______""--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them & I kept saying ""Quiero _______."" Interpretation I can't interpret the beginning of the dream, but perhaps the ending of it symbolizes the desire I have to travel. I spent some time at school in A--- & always have wished to return someday. My fiance & I both plan to go there together. We have both taken Spanish, but not enough to speak fluently. Answers to questions 2. I was angry and unhappy because of the people at the restaurant. Then I was perplexed and sad for everyone was going on a trip. 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. None of the places seemed familiar. 6. No 7. No"
"0380"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 10/22/47) I dreamed I was at a recording dance. It was either in a small room or barn. Not many people were there & I was just standing and watching as my fiance wasn't with me. I saw two fellows dancing who I recognized, but the girls with them were unknown. Both fellows went to high school with me and I knew them very well, although I have never gone out with either of them. The one is now engaged while the other is at A. I saw a M. girl dancing and although she's engaged, she was not with her fiance. I wished I could dance too and felt since the fellows were old frlends they could have asked me to be nice, but they didn't. I couldn't see how the girl was able to dance when I couldn't. Interpretation I miss not being able to go to dances and other activities since my fiance is away at school. This loneliness shows up in my dreams. Either that or the fact that I went to a tea dance as I had to be a hostess and perhaps feel guilty because I danced one dance with a strange fellow. Answers to questions 2. I felt lonesome and sad. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. A small room or barn 6. No 7. No"
"0381"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 11/01/47) I was in a huge school gym which resembled the one I used for handcraft on a playground while directing this summer. I was wrapping packages and decorating them. Others who I cannot recognize were doing the same thing. We found a decoration for a package which we thought was wonderful and beautiful. It was simply pasting one narrow piece of tape (dark colored) in the middle of a wider piece of tape like this: This was a great idea in the dream. Someone who I was familiar with, but can't recall now, criticized my wrapping and I felt bad and angry too. I also remember placing a candle in each corner of a package for design like this: I saw the words ""Medicine inside--Handle with care"" on boxes. It seemed to be concerned with the Pharmaceutical Co. my father works for as I talked with his boss. Everyone left except me and I kept wrapping. A colored girl came in to clean and then a colored man. I heard him say to the colored girl that he was going to pick all the pockets of the coats and the pocket books before the people returned to work. I was furious and tried to stop him, but he smiled and pushed me violently away. I forgot to say earlier that in order to wrap the packages we had to lick the tape. It tasted so bad and my mouth became sticky and dry, so that I could hardly swallow. It was awfully frightening and uncomfortable too. Interpretation The gym has been identified. I can't see the significance of the packages, although I had been at my fiance's for dinner and we ate by 4 candles. We mentioned the lovely design reflected on the ceiling. My fiance wanted more light to eat by, so we put on the electric lights. However he had eaten the night before with me at my house by 5 candles and said then that it was fine. We all commented on this. My fiance and I had used my parents' car during the day, and we had to park it unlocked. This worried me as it was loaded with some medicine, and I knew my Dad wouldn't like it if he knew, because of the chance of theft. Perhaps this accounts for the threat of theft by the colored man. As to the dry taste in my mouth, I can't interpret it. I have had this dream of a dry mouth which hinders swallowing and finally leads to a feeling of not being able to get my breath many times. It is always very vivid and frightening. Answers to questions 2. I felt angry and also frlghtened 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant. When it wasn't unpleasant it was void of description or dull. 5. A gymnasium similar to one I worked in. This one had more light and was more modern. 6. Only the part about swallowing has occurred before. 7. No"
"0382"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 11/05/47) I dreamed I was in the upstairs of a double house visiting one of my girl friends. She is 20 yrs. old and I've known her about 10 years. The house was strange. I was afraid of some Indians out in the back yard who were after me for some reason. I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office. Interpretation The evening I had the dream I had visited my girl friend with my parents. We stayed quite late, so I had to stay up even later when I got home to finish The Prairie by Cooper, which was due the next day: This book is about Indians and their wars and friendships with white settlers. I was worrled I wouldn't finish the book, but I did. Thus I got away from the Indians. My sister just started working with my girlfriend B. who told me how she was getting along. My sister has had 3 yrs. of college and is now in an office with girls who have had none--thus she feels rather superior to the job as a whole. I identified myself with my sister in my dream, for I'd like to be able to work to have money to buy some clothes, but I can't when I'm in school. The feeling of superiority is something I don't wish to have. My fur coat just came out of storage that afternoon, thus I have it on in the dream. Answers to questions 2. I feared the Indians. I felt confident in the store. 3. Actual participant 4. Both 5. A strange upstairs of double house. A strange department store and office. 6. No 7. Colors in my scarf were light blue and rose. I have one in reality like it which I like, but can't wear now as it is torn."
"0383"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 11/07/47) I dreamed I was driving a car. It seemed I was sitting up high and close to the steering wheel. At times the car had only two wheels and other times it resembled a bike. I was driving very fast and confidently. I don't remember who was with me, but I was not alone. It seems I was driving around the block in front of my fiance's house and also in front of my girlfriend's house. My fiance is 23 and the girl is 20. Interpretation I was antlcipating my fiance's arrival in C. He always takes me out for a driving lesson and I was no doubt looking forward to it.

"0384"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 11/20/47) I dreamed I was sitting on the front porch of our cottage. It was dreary and rainy outside. I saw my Aunt sitting on a swing which hung from the ceiling (We do not have any such swing). She had a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on which fitted down over her nose in a peculiar muzzle-like way. I remember particularly a piece of the contraption fitted down the nose, following an indentation between the nostrils, like this. In a wicker stand were some plants which we were admiring. All at once the plants heaved upward, and a pig emerged oinking loudly. We all laughed and thought the pig was darling. We became very attached to the animal. Interpretation My Aunt has a slight dimple in her nose, but nothing compared to the one in the dream. I can't figure out why she would be wearing such glasses or what it would symbolize. The first pair of glasses I had were gold rimmed & I have always disliked having to wear glasses. I seemed to grow to like the pig as I liked our dog which died about 2 years ago. We had the dog for 12 years and he always loved our cottage. We buried him out at the cottage & perhaps the emergence of the pig from the flower box is symbolic of our dog's grave.

She had company in and when we all went into the living room I saw that she had put the furniture back in its original position. I was absolutely furious & hurt to think that I had spent my whole day rearranging the room only to find that Mother had switched the furniture around when my back was turned. I told her just what I thought of this in front of the company. I was very frank and brazen about it. Interpretation In reality I had spent the Saturday helping my mother change the furniture in the living room when I really should have been doing homework.

"0386"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 12/01/47) I dreamed I was with a strange fellow climbing up steep steps to get to a seat in a theater. I saw two friends of my mother's. These women (about 50 yrs. old) were made up quite extremely & I felt a great distaste for them. For some reason or other the curtain was half up. I could see an actor In a red room climb into a coffin. Although I realized it was only a stage setting, I felt frightened & turned to my companion for assurance. We left almost at once as if the play were over. We walked down many, many stairs which were covered all the way down with an awning of green stripes. When we got outside we could look back & see the different landings of the steps covered with one huge awning. Each landing led to an exclusive night club. There were about 5 neon signs. Interpretation I seemed to be very attracted to the strange fellow altho I realized I was engaged to someone else. This would seem to indicate I'm not happy about my engagement which I can't seem to fit at all. Perhaps this stranger was merely a substitution for my fiance. We had been to the Pu-- A--- several nights previously & had to climb steep steps. We saw ""Desert Song"" in which the hero wore red. At the entrance of the A--- was a green & white awning for it was snowing badly. My fiance & I haven't been to a night club for quite a while because he is away at school & when he comes home we have other things more important to do. Besides it is expensive. Perhaps I have a wish to go, if so it isn't conscious. Answers to questions 2. I was having a grand time. I was afraid at what I saw on the stage, & I was disdainful of my mother's friends. 3.

"0387"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 12/10/47) I dreamed I was upstairs in H--- Hall making a phone call to a girlfriend. (She is 20) At times I seemed to be in a bedroom & at other times the hall was being used as a dining hall. There was a large, long table at which many M--- girls were sitting. I kept talking on the phone & the girls at the table kept calling for me to come eat. Then the scene was again changed to a bedroom & I was still on the phone. All at once some girl came bounding through my room on her hands & feet, like an ape. I thought she was just kidding & then another girl stuck her head in the door & and said ""Did you see her?"" I told her I had & asked if she were just being silly. She said, ""No, she's always like that!"" Interpretation The setting was H--- Hall because I've spent so much time there practicing for S--- Night. It also accounts for the large group of girls. The girl I was calling lives at H--- so I can't understand why I was calling her at some other place. I had tried to call her one night this week from my home & she was out. Perhaps the ape-like antics is a reflection of the S--- Night antics we've been practicing so diligently. Answers to questions 2. I don't remember any real emotions.

"0388"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 20, 12/12/47) I dreamed I had a girl over for dinner. The girl is 20 & I know her fairly well as she is in my class. After dinner, I told her I hoped she enjoyed being at my house to eat. She said the food was fine, but that she had not had enough water. She said my father ""hogged"" the water pitcher & drank so much that when she wanted some it was all gone. She enumerated other things which weren't done the way her family does them. I can't remember what they were but I felt pretty bad about it. Interpretation I can't understand this at all. The girl has never been to my house. She needs a flashlight for a stunt she's in & I told her I would lone her my father's when I saw her this afternoon. My father always has to have water at his meals. My entire family likes water with the meal, though, so I can't seem to interpret this part of the dream. Answers to questions 2. Sad. I was unhappy that the girl found so much fault. 3.

I don't know where, but I met and talked with many school friends. When I returned to my aunt she was still talking to the football player. I was amazed to find her so interested in the fellow as he was not the polished, refined typed which she approves of. Interpretation I believe this dream was caused by the anticipation of returning to school after vacation. Therefore I was meeting many school mates and was in H. Why my aunt should be there too, I don't know. Answers to questions 2. I was surprised to see my aunt. I was busy meeting everyone. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. H. Hall 6. No 7. No"
"0391"	"None"	"(Code 051, Age 21, 01/05/48) I dreamed I was working in a department store with people I had gone to high school with. During my lunch hour I went to a library with my girlfriend (21 yrs.) to get a book out. I had to walk uphill. In the library I found a book which I needed for a class at some school. It was a reference book so I hunted for another copy. The book seemed to be about King Arthur, but it was only to be found in the F. room. Along with the books were also pots and pans on the shelves. After working we waited on the corner for the bus. I saw among the group two fellows who I knew very well and were good friends in high school. They admired my engagement ring. Interpretation I imagine that returning to school reminded me of my high school days. The idea that I was working probably arises from the fact that I'm anxious to finish school and work for a change. Perhaps the pots and pans symbolize marriage for I also plan to marry after graduation. I have been getting things together that I will need for keeping house. Answers to questions 2. I didn't have any particular emotions. I imagine I was happy more than anything else. 3. Actual participant 4."
"0392"	"None"	"(Code 052, Age 23, 06/23/48) I had been waiting a long time for some duck eggs to hatch. There were 13. I didn't count them but I knew there were 13. As I watched, twelve of the eggs began to crack open and pieces of the shells were scattered all over. Then, just as the tops of the little ducks' heads appeared, all activity stopped and I knew they were all dead. I took one egg that was left and moved it to the side of the nest away from the others. Then it cracked open and a little duck emerged. I picked it up in my hand and put it in a bucket of water to teach it to swim. Interpretation I don't know what this dream means. I can't think of any explanation at all. Answers to questions 2. I felt very affectionate and kind toward the little duck. This is strange because I can't stand baby chickens and ducks. I especially hate to touch them. 3. An actual participant. 4. Pleasant. 5. My back yard. 6. No 7. No"
"0393"	"None"	"(Code 052, Age 23, 06/24/48) I was attending a tea party with eight other women (all aged between 40 and 60). They were teachers from the school where I teach. The principal was also there (F-40). She was very angry with all of us teachers because we had gone to the party and left our classes alone in the rooms. But we just let her fume and we went on having a good time. Then, later, I wss walking back to my classroom and I stopped to read a notice on the bulletin board. It read, ""Room 109, (my room) 1st grade, may use the gym at 4:08 each day."" Interpretation I think both parts are wish-fulfillment. The first part is a desire to openly defy the principal. She is a fussy, finicky woman and I often feel like ""telling her off"" but I never have. The next part is a wish to teach 1st grade next fall. It is the grade I like best, but I have recently been teaching the 3rd grade. I don't understand the meaning of the time - 4:08. At 4:08 the children are not in school. Answers to questions 2. I was happy in the whole dream - especially the second part. 3. An actual participant. 4. Pleasant. 5. The teachers' lunch room at the school where I teach was the setting of the first part.

I don't remember her telling me why; I believe she just said she was going to get a divorce. I was very unhappy and I cried and cried. Interpretation This could mean that I am envious of the fact that my sister married before I did although she is younger than I am. My unhappiness or anxiety in the dream could have been caused by the conflict between this repressed jealousy and the idea that such thoughts are wrong and wicked. Answers to questions 2. I was extremely unhappy and distressed. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5. My bedroom at home 6. No 7. No"

I kept hoping that something would happen so that I wouldn't have to marry him. But nothing did, and the day of the wedding finally arrived. I was frantic because no arrangements had been made. I went dashing around in a long white dress and a veil inviting people to the wedding. Then I was inside the building where the ceremony was to take place.

"0396"	"None"	"(Code 052, Age 23, 07/06/48) I was walking along a path which ran beside a broad, calm river. Then the path turned away fromthe river and ran through a thick forest. The forest began to grow thicker and darker. I was frightened, but something compelled me to walk on. Suddenly, I was out of the woods and standing at the edge of a large open space. In the middle of this clearing I saw a beautiful house. It was a large, white house with blue awnings at the windows, and three white pillars at the front. Hundreds of yellow roses were climbing around the pillars. It was a lovely scene, but it was very frightening. I wanted to go back, but something seemed to draw me toward the house. Then, as I came close to it, the whole house began to tremble and collapse. I turned and began to run toward the forest. Before I reached it, I awoke. Even after I awoke, it took a long time to get rid of the feeling of terror. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. As I walked beside the river I was happy.

I started to fall, but the chasm wasn't very wide and I managed to stop my fall by bracing my feet against one wall and my shoulders against the other. Then I looked down, and it seemed as though I could see down for at least a mile. At the bottom were a lot of tiny houses. I was terribly frightened, because I was growing tired and I knew I would soon fall. I woke up then, but every time I closed my eyes I could see that long drop.

We were talking about a class we had taken together. Then a tall, fat white man--a stranger about 50--came over and pointed a gun at my friend and forced him to get off the streetcar. The white man said it made him sick to see a negro talking to a white person. Then, as my friend was walking across the street, the man shot him in the back. I got off the car and ran over to him, but he was dead. I felt sad and I cried. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2.

Suddenly, the plane began to fall toward some trees. I screamed, and then my boyfriend changed into another friend of mine (M-28). Then we were out of the plane and walking around on the bottom of the ocean. It was very beautiful, and I felt quite happy. We were walking toward a large building which seemed to be a church.

A queer animal - a cross between a spider and an octopus - started wrapping his tentacles around her neck. I tried to pull him away but I couldn't. Then I started cutting the tentacles with a pair of scissors. Finally I succeeded in removing it and dropping it into a pail of scalding water. In the water it turned into an enormous yellow toad.

I ran outdoors just in time to see one of our planes begin to fall. It crashed in our front yard and began to burn. Then I saw that the pilot was one of my friends (M-27).

"0405"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 06/24/48) This dream took place in a small room - I don't know where - in which the O.W. Choir (of which I am a member) was congregated. We were rehearsing some popular pieces when a large group of women entered the room. As I remember, almost all of them seemed to be wearing furs. I kept getting up to offer my seat to them, but no one accepted it. The conductor changed the song immediately and we began to sing classical numbers. The women sat along a window sill, and I seemed to keep moving from chair to chair. The director then measured the length of our robes to see that they were three inches from the floor. Interpretation It seems that there must have been more to this dream, but I cannot recall anything further. The only connection which I can make is that I had recently thought of my choir director at school, as there is a high school music clinic going on there now. The idea of measuring our robes seems to revert back to high school, as our director insisted upon our robes being three inches from the floor. I find no connection to the women, or the idea of offering my seat. Answers to questions 2. There was no particular emotion, as I cannot even recall the music. 3. I felt like an actual participant. 4. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant but more or less passive. 5. A small room which was not familiar and contained about fifteen (15) chairs.

I was very hungry, but no one would wait on me. Then a sailor sat down beside me and put his arm around me. He seemed to be half asleep. I was very insulted, and immediately walked out. I then discovered I had a book of his which merely said ""scrapbook"" on the front. I decided to return it, but couldn't find him. I then saw a parade of sailors coming down the street. I wrote my name and address inside the book, and said I was sorry I had been so rude to him. I ran up beside one of the sailors (who was a girl) and asked if she could return it. She said she could locate him by the number on the book (which I had not noticed previously). Interpretation I can find no connection with the A. V.! I had previously visited a girlfriend who is engaged to a sailor, although I hadn't thought of him at all. The scrapbook might have been connected with the fact that I had left my notebook in class that day, and later found it. I find no meaning to the parade, meeting my mother, or the female sailor! Answers to questions 2. I had a very sad feeling after the sailor left, as he seemed very pathetic, and I was sorry I hadn't been nice to him. 3. I was a participant. 4.

"0407"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 06/29/48) I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember. Interpretation I might interpret this dream by a feeling of jealousy towards my sister, but I have never felt this way. The only explanation I can find is that I sometimes say to my folks, ""You let Marge do it when she was my age,"" in order to do something my folks dislike. Maybe this dream was my punishment! However, I definitely have no feelings of jealousy toward my sister. My room at present is done in pink, and my sister's room many years ago was in green. Why I dreamed of this or a mansion I don't know. Answers to questions 2. I felt perplexed, jealous, and a little angry. 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. My entire home (supposedly) but mainly my and my sister's bedrooms. 6. No 7. Yes, green and pink."
"0408"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/01/48) At the beginning of this dream it took place in a hotel lobby. A friend of mine was standing at a desk, and presently she came over to me with something hidden inside her coat. It turned out to be chocolate, eggs, sugar, and all the ingredients necessary to make fudge. We ran upstairs with these things hidden. The building then seemed to be built like A Hall, and it seemed that we climbed about six flights of stairs. On the top floor we found there was a radio broadcast going on, so we had to sneak down again. There seemed to be about fifteen girls mingling around who eventually began to chase us. This is all I recall, except that at the end the ingredients were combined and we were running with a pan of fudge. Interpretation I often have a desire to make fudge around home, especially when home alone, I usually don't tell my folks when I make it, and perhaps that accounts for my trying to hide it in the dream. My first class at Reserve is in A. on the third floor, and perhaps this accounts for the climbing of stairs. As for the radio broadcast and the group of girls, I can't quite figure that out. Answers to questions 2. I felt excited, anxious, tired of running up the stairs. 3. Actual Participant 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. A hotel, and a building resembling A. College. 6. No. 7. No."
"0409"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/08/48) This dream seemed to be especially long, and especially realistic. After I awoke I realized how absurd it really was. It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall. Interpretation The only connection I can make to this dream is my worry about my boyfriend being short! (about my height) The prevalent thing in the dream was that Wade was tall. When I awoke I felt as though I had been crying all night. It took a long time to get this dream out of my mind. No one in the dream was familiar to me, except my father. I had never seen Wade before. The murderer wore a plaid sweater and was a good friend. I told my father who he was because I felt revengeful about Wade's death. I can't connect the airplane or boat or any of the people. Answers to questions 2. Very sad, also anger, fear, and deep emotion. 3. An actual participant 4. Both unpleasant and pleasant. 5. A boat, a road, a farmhouse, and an airplane. 6. No 7. No"
"0410"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/09/48) This dream was a very disconnected one. It began when I was riding in a car with my girlfriend's boyfriend. The two of them had had a fight. It seems that we drove for hours and hours. Later I got out of the car and started walking. A middle aged man picked me up and put my suitcase in the back of the car(!!) He kept giving me sly looks and I realized he was going to kidnap me. Five young men came down the street and walked straight towards me. I said, ""Don't you dare take another step!"" and they stopped. The next thing I knew I was in A------. I was walking with someone who was saying something to the Eskimos. It seemed that he was saying ""oogie woogie"" or some similar phrase such as that! I remember it was very cold and there was a sharp wind. I remember seeing a great deal of snow. Interpretation One connection I can make with this dream is that I had been driving quite a bit the day I had this dream. Possibly the idea of my being in A------ is also connected, as one of my girlfriend's fiancee is stationed there. Also, the girlfriend's boyfriend who was in the dream had really had a fight with his girl the day before. I can't explain the idea of being kidnapped or the five young men! Answers to questions 2. A little fright, but mainly no particular emotion. 3. An actual participant 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. A car, and A------ (a snowy road) 6. No 7. No"

However, it took place in a rather barren room, which was evidently my living quarters. I had captured a tiger (!) and kept it stuffed in a large chest. The tiger knew something which I wanted to know, so I told him I would free him if he would tell me. The tiger had the face of a man, and stood on his hind legs. The last I remember, we were in a telephone booth together making an important phone call. Interpretation I can't think of any connection to this dream. I hadn't seen any Frank Buck movies, or given any thought to tigers! The tiger's face looked like that of a boy in my Psychology of Adolescence class This boy is always interrupting in class and monopolizing most of the class period. Answers to questions 2. Anxious. Whatever the information was that the tiger had, I was very eager to get it. 3. An actual participant 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. A dim room composed of a wooden chest and bureau. 6. No 7. Yes, the yellow on the tiger, and the dingy brown color of the room."

We were going on a picnic and I was riding in the backseat while my boyfriend drove. We came to a steep hill which we couldn't get up. This hill suddenly changed to the hill at C --- P--- Theater, and fire engines were chasing each other up and down it! I felt as though I was still at D-------, and I was fearful that the dorm was on fire. Interpretation A few days before this dream I had heard several fire engines, and was tempted to find the fire. I hadn't been thinking about D----- my boyfriend, or a picnic. Perhaps my worry about the dorm burning up was caused by the fact that the dorm I lived in, is an old fire trap, and we were constantly having fire drills. Answers to questions 2. I felt anxiety and frustration at not being able to get up the hill - also I felt excitement over the fire engines. 3. An actual participant 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. A steep hill in a park. 6. No 7. I was conscious only of the red fire engines."
"0413"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/19/48) This dream took place in an apartment which was supposedly my home, and was located on Cedar, near the top of Cc--- Hill. The building resembled an apartment, but the bottom floor was a huge mansion in which I lived. I saw two girls I knew, both named Virginia, and was talking to them through the window. I suddenly realized that I had missed a girlfriend's wedding, in which I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. The wedding took place at 9:45. I ran downstairs, and suddenly our basement was composed of many long tunnels with wooden posts, cobwebs, and insects. It resembled a mine and had many rooms off of it. I was with my freshman year roommate at college, and we were being pursued by an invisible worn! My roommate said something which angered the worm, and the next thing I knew she was being cut by a razor blade! I recall seeing scratches on her face and blood coming from there. Interpretation Perhaps this dream illustrates my aggressive tendencies! found myself frantically running from something, although I don't know what it would have been in real life. The house or basement was nothing which I had ever seen before. I had been looking through my Heights yearbook recently, and remember seeing the pictures of the two Virginias in my dream. Why I should dream of an invisible worm with a razor, I do not know, unless it is a phallic symbol. Answers to questions 2. I felt anxiety and fear. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant. 5.

"0414"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/22/48) In this dream my father was going to take a group of us for an airplane ride, including my sister (23), my mother (52), a girlfriend of my sister's (23), and myself. Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't. Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M. University. I was walking on the fourth floor of a dormitory, and the floor was broken up into big pieces which were revolving. Someone came up to me and asked me who turned on the switch to have the floors revolve. This was connected with the airplane ride, as someone said that the reason the floor was revolving was because there was an airplane someplace near by. Interpretation The dream seems to indicate a feeling of my sister's preference in the family. The friend of my sister's was a girl who I have not seen or thought of for years. The dominance of my mother in the dream relates to reality, for she is always the disciplining factor in the family. The revolving floors might show a feeling of insecurity or fear of rejection. Answers to questions 2. Anxious, angry, and fearful. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant 5. A field someplace, and a dormitory (which was not familiar) at M. University. 6. No 7. No"

Suddenly a woman loomed forward and insisted I had cheated. I recall crying bitterly. Interpretation Perhaps my desire for financial independence from my mother is indicated in this dream, by the presence of a monetary prize, and the woman who insisted I had cheated. Or perhaps I have a repressed desire to cheat! Answers to questions 2. I felt very anxious, frustrated, angry and sad. 3. An actual participant. 4. Unpleasant 5. A stage with a microphone. 6. No 7.

"0416"	"None"	"(Code 053, Age 21, 07/28/48) I dreamed I was at a party, composed of a mixed crowd of adults. Each person had some sort of an animal with him, and these animals were entered in a contest. They were to burrough in the ground and the first to reach the goal was the winner. I then suddenly found myself completely alone. Interpretation The presence of adults might indicate my desire to be treated as an adult and be free of dependency. The contest might be my struggle for recognition, and at the same time my fear of rejection and conflict about becoming independent would be indicated by being left alone. Answers to questions 2. I felt passive, unconcerned. 3. An actual participant 4. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 5. Someone's living room--unfamiliar 6. No 7. No"
"0417"	"None"	"(Code 059, Age 23, 09/28/47) I had a job in some sort of plant (factory) and I worked at a machine which resembled a cream separator used on small farms. I cannot recall the operation of this machine at all. The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act. Interpretation I do not have a definite interpretation of this dream. I can associate the tomatoes with the fact that I have always enjoyed eating raw tomatoes but why they would appear in an unpleasant dream is not clear to me.

"0418"	"None"	"(Code 059, Age 23, 10/06/47) Setting- our pond at home, it was late fall, the trees were all bare and it was cold outdoors. Characters -five men who were strangers. I was not able to distinguish them as to age but they appeared to be dressed as business men. Action - A glider plane landed on the water close to the dam. The landing seemed to be smooth but actually it was a forced landing. I recall seeing the ship sink slowly in the water but recall no action until I saw the five bodies, in miniature size, lying together in the bottom of an ordinary pail. I did not question the fact the bodies had suddenly became so small and know of no reason for it. I was alone watching this action from a distance but later when I saw the bodies' our St. Bernard dog was with me. I experienced no dread, only surprised wonder and sadness. Interpretation I enjoy flying a great deal and for this reason the appearance of a plane is not novel to me. I must have gotten my ships a little mixed up though, for while the action of a ship landing on our pond is not new, since it occurred last year in the late fall, the ship was a heliocopter, equipped for amphibious landings. I was not at home when this occurred and was very disappointed about it, so it would seem that even though I was unable to place myself in the dream as a passenger at least I had the satisfaction of being able to see it. However, the feeling of sadness which I experienced upon the realization that people had been drowned in our pond is directly related to by conscious feeling of fear that someone, some day, may drown in our pond, for at its deepest end it is approximately 15 feet deep. The presence of strangers is most likely a manifestation of the new groups of people I have met here at W.R.U. The presence of the pail and the dog only served to make the dream more closely related to my past experiences. Answers to questions 2. Surprised and sad. 3. Onlooker 4. Unpleasant 5.

"0419"	"None"	"(Code 059, Age 23, 10/11/47) Setting - a restaurant on the campus of the college I was attending. Characters -my father and brother, 2 student waiters, several old women and an average restaurant crowd. Action - I had planned on meeting my father and brother (who is in the Navy now but was a civilian here) at this restaurant. I spent a good deal of time looking for them among the crowd but finally found them. Then we sat down to eat but had to wait a long time until a waiter promised to take our order. I recall that there were two student waiters who were very busy taking care of serving several older women. Sometime during the action, I recall bumping into the waiters and having to excuse myself. I recall no other action but I do remember experiencing frustration when I was unable to find my dad and brother and even greater frustration when we were unable to get the waiter to take our order. Interpretation I interpret this dream as a manifestation of my desire to have my brother at home again and in a more broad sense my desire but my seemingly impossible hope of making my father look with less cynicism and distrust at the general topic -college. In this dream I seemed to have failed in that endeavor again although I recall nothing of my father's reaction. The entire situation was not a favorable one for my point of view. The presence of men student waiters is most likely an unconscious association with a student who I have met here who waits on tables. The appearance of older women probably suggest a part of the faculty, although I have had no reason for feeling a dislike toward them. Answers to questions 2. Anxious, frustrated 3.

"0435"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 09/16/47) I dreamt that I was to attend a Spanish class at 7:30 at night. I had to go to my room in the dormitory to get my books. I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach. Interpretation This dream took place shortly before school started, which explains its content. The reference to 7:30 is easily explained as I intended getting up the next day at that hour to attend an activities program for new students. My mayor is Spanish. I had been a little worried about how well I'd do this semester, because I'm transferring from 0. During my two years stay there I lived in a dormitory. I had been wondering how I would like living at home again after having had two extremely pleasant years of dormitory life. I cannot account for the balance of the dream. Answers to questions 2.

"0436"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 09/21/47) I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.) We ran on for what seemed close to an half hour. Then we reached a side street and stopped--assuring ourselves that we were no longer being pursued. The street seemed to be in the neighborhood of S C Ave., which is about 20 blocks from my home. I asked my brother if he wanted to take a cab home and then before he had replied, continued that I thought we would be safe on a streetcar. At that moment my parents came into view. They had both very obviously been drinking and were tottering on their feet and grinning stupidly. My mother said that she had had ten drinks. Our car was parked on the side street and we decided to go home. We got into the car and just before we left a policeman came up and gave us a ticket for parking in front of a fireplug. We drove up to 1 st. and started down when I realized all of a sudden that we were in the midst of a parade. All the paraders were colored people. They began shouting that we could not ride in their parade. Interpretation I believe the reason my brother entered the dream is that he has been overseas for 1 1/2 years and I have been anxiously looking forward to his return this fall. I had this dream two days after I saw the movie ""G."" Being of the J faith it naturally made a deep impression on me. Although I had never experienced any real difficulties because of my religious views, the picture brought out to me the many humiliating experiences which others of my faith have undergone. The whole issue of anti-semitism in the movie began with the invitation of Mr. S  (a J) to his apartment of some soldier's saying: ""What is the matter? D'ya think we're not good enough to drink your stinking liquor?"" The number ten may have arisen from the boasting of one of my young friends on the Saturday before my dream that he had consumed 10 bottles of beer at a picnic. The amount he had consumed greatly astounded me at the time. I cannot explain the fact that both my parents were drunk, as both drink very little. The difficulty we experienced with the policeman may have been due to the parking difficulties we have had of late. With reference to the parade of colored people, their place in my dream is probably due to the fact that we live in an almost entirely colored neighborhood and have been attempting unsuccessfully to find another house into which to move.

"0437"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 09/30/47) In my dream I am in a two-room doctor's office. The doctor's sex seems to fluctuate between male and female. There are two other patients in the office. One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street. Interpretation The doorless two-room office, I believe, may have been brought to my mind by the voting booths. I had noted for the first time that day and it left a deep impression on my mind. There has been a great deal of publicity of late with regard to Cancer Clinics, and I think the middle-aged woman in my dream symbolizes my aunt, who died of cancer two years ago. She, also, had two children. By cousin's presence may be accounted for by the fact that I am to be a bridesmaid at her wedding next month and have been very excited at the prospect. The ring box symbolizes her approaching wedding as does, I believe, the combing of her hair as if getting ready for the wedding. The voting booth was on the corner and I believe this fact corresponds to the last phase of my dream. The doctor, now, may be identified with my girlfriend--with whom I went to vote.

"0438"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 10/05/47) I am in a two-room office. It seems to be in the M. A. building. There are two women in the office. I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. ""I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. ""How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, "" I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away. Interpretation The two-room office here represents my advisor's office. I had been in to see her the previous day. The women from W. M. C. were probably brought to my mind because I saw one of them downtown recently and it had been a long time since I saw anyone from the office. The note I found in my box corresponds to the one I received from my advisor. She had advised me that through error, I had been placed in a class for which juniors were not eligible. She said she had not known about it (which corresponds to my statement that I could not have known about the papers.) My cousin probably entered my dream due to the fact that I was worried about him. I had heard that day that he was having marital difficulties and that his family (represented by his sister) were very perturbed. I cannot account for the presence of my S Prof. in my dream, nor why I should again be at OSU. The episode of the dress is equally unaccounted in my mind. My statement that I am no longer going steady is true. It probably explains my return to 0. S. U.--escape from unpleasant situation here. Answers to questions 2. Embarassment 3. Actual participant 4.

"0439"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 10/17/47) I am seated in a classroom. It is a course in Beginning German. Our teacher is a woman (face unfamiliar). It is the first day of class. The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss. Interpretation The episode in the German class can probably be explained by the fact that my boyfriend is taking German and experiencing difficulty with it. I remember telling him that I wish I knew German so that I could help him. I attempted to test him on a vocabulary list and we both laughed heartily over my pronunciation. The unusual costume of the head of the German Department brings to my mind the costumes sported by freshmen women the first week of school. The second phase of my dream would seem to represent my guilt feelings concerning sex. Of late I have noticed that my mind is frequently preoccupied with the subject of ""sex"" I have felt that my preoccupations were unhealthy. The episode of the psychology notebook escapes me. The third phase probably represents just plain wishful thinking. I hadn't kissed my boyfriend in a few days and was looking forward to it. I probably feign indifference to get back at him for not having kissed me. Answers to questions 2. Happy, excited. 3. Participant 4. Pleasant 5.

My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing. Interpretation This dream has little meaning for me. The only connection I can make with the hotel room is that my boyfriend and I have a standing joke about making a reservation at the S-- hotel, ""just to sleep together nothing else."" The girl in my dream used to go steady with my boyfriend, but is now married. It was she who introduced us. Perhaps this dream symbolizes the family disapproval with which our indiscretion would be met. Yet, this interpretation seems hard to accept, as we have never seriously considered transgressing. I suppose I must confess to being extremely curious of ""what it would be like."" Maybe the dream represents a conflict between my unconscious desire to have intercourse and a strict superego.

My mother, age 47, sister, age 19, and I decide to surprise him and be at the station to meet him. When we arrive, we see my brother and his boyfriend, age 19, also enlisted in the U. S. Army. They seem to see us, but pass right by. My brother then turns around, takes out a flashbulb camera and takes our picture. I then remember my mother embracing my brother and crying. I run up to my brother, hug him and with tears welling up into my eyes keep repeating that I am so glad he has finally come home. J remember that as I was hugging him, a little voice within me kept saying: ""See, you didn't have to worry about how you'd act when you saw ____._."" Interpretation My brother had called from S--, W-- Saturday night. He talked to my mother and dad but not to me, as I was not home. I was very excited about his call, and remember saying that I was glad in a way, that I had not been home as I wouldn't have known what to say to him. His boyfriend also called his mother that night to say that he would be home soon. The flashbulb camera brings to mind the fact that my sister asked me to take her flashbulb pictures to the photography shop the next day to be developed. The fact that my brother was planning to drop in on us unexpectedly may be explained by the fact that those were the plans he actually had. Answers to questions 2. Happiness 3. Actual participant 4.

"0442"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 10/29/47) I find myself in a small kitchen. It seems to be on the second floor. My cousin, girl age 19, is with me. We decide to go for a walk. As we are walking we pass a large field. A wedding seems about to take place. I see the bride, also a cousin, age 24, dressed in a bridal gown. One of my aunts (can't remember who) came up to us and asks us why we aren't ready. We assure her that we will hasten home and get ready. On the way home we pass a fruit store. My mother and dad are just coming out the door. I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up. Interpretation The apartment is entirely unfamiliar to me. My cousin age 17, is to be a bridesmaid at my other cousin's age 24 wedding. This is the second dream I've had about her wedding. I explain it as due to my excitement at being a bridesmaid for the first time. My gown was being altered and I greatly feared that it wouldn't fit upon its completion. This probably accounts for the fact that it was too large in my dream. The housedress episode seems to symbolize my refusal to believe that the dress would be too large.

"0443"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 10/31/47) It is toward evening. I am getting into a station wagon. My sister, age 18, also gets in. There are 2 or 3 other people in the car but I do not recall their sex or identity. I seem to be riding in the back seat, yet later I am in the front seat. There is also a dog riding with us in the front seat. The locale in which we are riding is unfamiliar to me. After we have ridden awhile my sister and I express desire to use the women's washroom. We stop in front of a building which resembles somewhat H. Chapel. We alight and go in. We find the women's washroom. It is an immense room which resembles none I've seen. There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain. However the backs were left completely open. I looked through the back entrance of the cubby hole and saw a long bench on which a group of men were sitting. I looked and looked but could find no cubby hole whose back entrance was also covered. I woke up. It was about 3-4 in the morning. I felt an extreme urge to urinate. Interpretation I cannot interpret this dream. I have never ridden in a station wagon nor expressed a desire to do so. We have no dog at home. Perhaps the dog was brought to my mind by the fact that everyday on my way home I pass a pet shop. In each window there are about 1/2 dozen puppies.

I recognize one as being another one of my cousins. They are walking very slowly and approach our house. My mother and I are standing on the porch. We greet them. I ask my cousin how she is feeling and she responds that she feels well. I remember thinking to myself that I was so glad she was well and that now perhaps she would be able to keep her baby. All thou leave soon thereafter and they continue to walk very slowly down the street. All of a sudden she (the one who is to have a baby) appears to be suspended in air with her toes pointing toward the ground. I remember thinking: well, if she can do that she is all right. Interpretation At a family tea held Friday night I inquired if the cousin mentioned in my dream were going to be there.

"0445"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 11/10/47) I am walking down a street which I recognize as being near PHJH. A man, a woman, and a baby in a carriage approach me. I can see the man and woman's features very clearly. They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight. Interpretation I have been contemplating marriage with a student of the University and have spent quite a bit of thought on the fact that I would not be able to have children for perhaps 4-5 yrs. I believe this child symbolizes the child I would not be able to have. That is why I believe, when he appears to be 4-5 yrs. old, I still look the same. I would analyze the man's hostility toward his wife thus: It has often said that a wife neglects her husband upon the birth of a child and I am determined to divide my love upon the birth of my child in order that my husband should not be deprived of any previous relationship.

"0446"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 11/11/47) My dream takes place in the basement of what appears to be my former high school (G). I remember that it is quite dark in the basement and I was alone. I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away. Interpretation Two possibilities occur to me in interpretation of this dream. Perhaps the dream actually represents a fear of being attacked. We live in a practically totally negro-populated neighborhood. I have felt a bit scared upon walking down the street at night, but somehow I don't think it would manant a dream of this type. Stretching the imagination a bit, I can see that it might indirectly point to a desire for sexual intercourse.

There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed. Interpretation I can well understand my dreaming about the source theme. It is due Wednesday and I haven't started it as yet. (writing it, that is.) The cards probably represent the fact that I feel I don't have enough information to write a source theme with. I put off the writing for today and have had no little anxiety concerning it. The episode of the woman and little girl doesn't bring anything to mind. Although the fact that she referred to her as the princess probably refers to the much publicised Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The episode of impending death would seem to indicate a fear of death on my part, but an uneacelingness to believe that it could actually happen to me. I confess to having given the matter a great deal of thought at various times in my life, but none recently. I know that I do not fear death, my only fear is that I may die young, before having experienced a happy married life and the joy of having children. Answers to questions 2.

"0448"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 12/08/47) This dream I am not a participant at any time. The dream first takes place in a train terminal. I see a boy and girl embracing. Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little. Interpretation I do not understand the ""oil"" element of this dream. This dream seems to be another of a series of dreams concerning marriage, which I am contemplating. I can well understand the occurrence of mother-in-law in the dream as I am a bit frightened at the prospect of acquiring one. I did not get off to such a good start with my boyfriend's mother and am afraid I may run into a little difficulty with her. The preserved flowers represent my proposed marriage, I suppose. The food episode seems to represent my anxiety that we will not be able to live on $90 a month. Answers to questions 2. None 3. Just an onlooker 4. Neither 5.

"0449"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 12/08/47) I am in a department store (resembling H--). I seem to be on a floor other than the first. Preparations are being made for a style show, in which I am to participate. I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said ""We allow no pets here."" One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says ""yes"" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day. Interpretation The theme of my dream would seem to indicate a desire for clothes. My wardrobe has been quite depleted and I have been contemplating replenishing it. I have been pretty anxious about my lack of clothes as I do not feel as self-confident when I am not well dressed. My boyfriend, also, has been insisting that I buy myself something to wear. The appearance of the duck and dog, I guess was a convenient way to introduce the theme of petting into my dream. I am contemplating getting engaged and we have discussed the possibility of petting as a preparation for the intimacies of marriage. However, both of us decided we would have severe feelings of guilt if we did pet. I cannot account for the balance of my dream except to state that the girl who is in my S-- class has always reminded me of a model. Answers to questions 2. Cannot remember emotions. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. A department store, upstairs and basement. 6. No 7. I was especially conscious of blue and yellow.

"0450"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 12/11/47) I remember walking out of a house and continuing my walk down a main thoroughfare. A man (short, middle-aged, shabby) unfamiliar to me is following me. He has something wrapped in newspaper which he wants to sell me. He says something to me and I remember the word ""cotton."" I tell him ""no"" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off. I draw close and see a huge scar across the hand of the woman. There is no blood. I keep repeating ""I did it, I did it."" I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning. Interpretation I cannot determine what the man stands for in my dream. The woman I feel, although I hate to admit, would seem to be my boyfriend's mother. She didn't look like her, but the scar on her hand resembled the one my boyfriend has on his wrist. This dream corroborates my other dream analysis in which I stated that I was afraid that my relationship with my future mother-in-law may not be a very happy one. Answers to questions 2.

"0451"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 12/29/47) I seemed to be in a drawing class sitting around a long table. The class was instructed to draw a duck. Another girl was sitting at my table but I can't remember who she was. We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember. One of the girls reads a story about ducks. All of the girls laugh. We then go back to our seats. It's getting dark. Another class comes up from the basement ready to go home. This class consists of all small children, mostly dressed in snowsuits. I get angry because we have not been told to go home. Then teacher says we can go home and wishes us a happy Easter. Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says ""Oh, you've got one, too!"" I ask her if she just got hers. She says ""no."" Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger. Interpretation This dream seems to tie in with the Christmas dinner we had at my fiance's home. The duck would seem to represent the goose we ate. After dinner my fiance and I had a discussion about how differently our respective homes were run- the fact that his mother was much more economical in buying and using her food and in furnishing her home. I guess the discussion raised a doubt in my mind as to whether or not he and I would see eye to eye on the expenditure of money. The episode of the ring is pretty obvious to me. I became engaged ~ few weeks ago and as is pretty common with girls, I wondered what others would think of my ring. I was also a little doubtful as to whether I liked it or not. The drawing and crayons I find difficult to fit in as I have no interest in them and can't imagine what they could symbolize. Easter probably represents Christmas. The only thing I am reminded of with regard to the lights is that before my fiance and I had our discussion, we had to turn on the light in the kitchen. Answers to questions 2.

"0452"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 12/31/47) This dream was quite a bit longer, but all I can remember is that the stone seemed to have come loose from my diamond engagement ring. At first I thought I had lost it, but someone helped me find it (I think it was my fiance, age 23) Interpretation My fiance and I had a long talk New Year's morning. I hadn't spent a very happy renew Year's Eve and we were attempting to get to the bottom of it. The dream seems to symbolize his attempt to help me out of my difficulty. I had not been very proud of him that night and we both wondered if it would occur again. He told me that if it occurred with too great frequency we would probably not be very happy together and in such an event we would have to terminate our engagement. I told him I'd try hard not to let little things bother me because I think we can have a successful marriage. Finding the stone seems to indicate a happy ending, and in truth the evening ended on a happy note. Answers to questions 2. None 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. cannot recall 6. No 7. No"
"0453"	"None"	"(Code 064, Age 21, 01/05/48) I seemed to be attending a party in my home. I recognized two of the people as being my cousin (a girl, age 30) and her husband. There were many people present. I was holding a baby which seemed to be my cousin's. He talked quite fluently for his age and I was much impressed by his intelligence. The scene shifts to my aunt's home (age 40). She seems to be showing me around her house. We come to one room that is empty and looks as if it had not been used in years. She then shows me a bedroom and I particularly notice the gay bedspread and matching drapes. We come to another room and I notice that it contains a double bed and two twin beds. I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure. Interpretation The party probably represents the engagement party my mother plans to give in my honor quite soon. My cousin probably enters the dream as we were discussing the fact that she recently had a miscarriage. The scene in my aunt's home probably occurred because of the lengthy conversations I have had with my fiance, my parents and friends about the difficulty of finding an apartment and my wondering about how I would furnish it. The empty room can probably be explained by the fact that if we get a house or a large apartment we will probably close off one room as we cannot afford to furnish an entire house. The issue of twin and double beds arose in our discussion (my fiancees and mine) and we found that a double bed had the greater asset balance. The slip and its figures represents my aunt's charge acct. at a wholesale house for linens which she suggested to us was at our disposal when I buy linens. Answers to questions 2. cannot recall 3.

I went around to the entrance on the West Side of the building but the door was locked and there was a sign on the door giving directions to go around to the front entrance on E Avenue. I knew there wasn't any entrance on E but I went anyway. When I got there I found a beautiful building of Georgian architecture - long and low with about 10 pillars. It was beautifully landscaped with grass, evergreens and tall trees. I just stood and looked at it. Interpretation I suppose it has something to do with sex and marriage but I can't give an interpretation of it. The trees are probably symbolic. Answers to questions 2.

Then about 20 famous movie stars came in and sat all around us. They kept making all kinds of noises, laughing, singing, and talking and I couldn't keep my mind on the performance. So I told my mother I was leaving and I would be back in a few minutes. I don't know where I went or what I did but when I came back the movie stars were gone and my mother was sitting among ordinary people who were quietly enjoying the performance.

They said they didn't need to wear gloves or use an anesthetic because the tree wasn't really an alive human being. Then they took out a saw and one of them began to saw off slices of the tree supposedly, but it was a human foot. They sliced off pieces just like meat (only it looked like cork).

"0481"	"None"	"(Code 070, Age 20, 09/27/47) I dreamed I was at my own wedding (I am not married). I was conscious of the fact that although my mother (age 44), my father (age 47), and my sister (age 22) were quite nervous, I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and happiness. As we walked down the aisle, which was down the center of an extremely large ballroom, the small orchestra was playing ""A1ways."" My groom (his face was not clear to me, and it was no one I know) was already at the altar and he was watching me intently. It took a long time for my parents and me to walk down the aisle; but all the while I returned my groom's gaze although I was aware that my parents were nodding to people in the audience and smiling at them. Suddenly, with my eyes still on my husband to be, I started to sing along with the orchestra. My mother was very startled and appeared to be a little embarrassed at my unconventiality, but my father quietly said to her, ""This is all hers."" My dream ends while I was still walking down the aisle and singing, and the whole audience, and my parents, were smiling and some of them were crying because of the great love my fiance and I had for each other. Interpretation In reality, I remember at by cousin's wedding she had the orchestra play this same song instead of the bridal march and it impresses me a great deal.

While I was playing, I could hear the others laughing and joking; and I was so afraid that I could not meet their standards, that I started to cry. I wondered why they did not need any practice and why I required so much. In the midst of my playing and with tears streaming down my face, I realized that suddenly a hush had come over the room. I kept on playing with an intense vigor and soon, the rest of the musicians had taken up their instruments and were accompanying me. When I finished, they all applauded me and I soon joined the group with a great feeling of satisfaction and happiness. Interpretation Evidently, I wanted very badly to be successful, but was terribly afraid that I was not. I expressed my defiance and overcame my anxiety by excelling in my work and getting the admiration of the group around me. Therefore, I might interpret it as an anxiety to succeed.

Lately, I had noticed she was bringing much food to the house, and that a number of packages were being delivered to the apartment, too. I decided then to do a little sleuthing. I took a ladder and placed it against the bedroom window. I carefully climbed up and just as I thought, there was a man sleeping in the bed. His face looked familiar to me but I couldn't remember from where.

When the streetcar came, I helped her on and then took her to a seat. She asked me to sit next to her, so I did.

She said she wanted to repay me in some way; and although, I was insistent that there was no need for it, she finally obtained my name and address.

He kept chasing me around the block; but despite the many people on the streets (many were C-- whom I knew) and despite the fact that he was blind, he relentlessly pursued me. He finally caught me and I tearfully told him that I had meant no harm. He started to laugh and said he was just trying to demonstrate that pity was wasted on him.

My parents, especially my mother, were so ashamed of their previous behavior that they came to us and begged for our forgiveness. My mother and I both cried and we embraced each other; and the four of us reached a very happy relationship.

I realized it was my own fault for not reading the assignments previously and I began reproaching myself for my neglect.

However, the cafeteria was out-of-doors wherein each person picked whatever he wanted directly from the ground where it was growing. As I was passing down the line, didn't find very many items of food which suited me, because, for some reason or other they seemed too fancy or too cumbersome. When I reached the cashier I found that fifty cents was the minimum, and since my lunch was much less than this, I bought several chances on a bicycle that was being raffled.

He kept muttering about people trying to sneak across the border whenever he wasn't looking--however, he wore no official uniform and merely looked like any ordinary gas station attendant.

Interpretation No interpretation. Answers to questions 2. I was annoyed when I couldn't turn on the light, and fearful when I contemplated the possibility of a fire. 3. Actual participant. 4.

"0516"	"None"	"(Code 071, Age 20, 09/25/47) I was walking down a street when I met the 2 girls who really do live across the street from me. They are 14 and 16. They had brand new children's tricycles and were very happily riding them about. As soon as they saw me, they started to show off by standing up while riding. They were too big for the bicycles and when they stood up while riding, I kept warning them it was unsafe and they should be more careful and sit down. The 16 yr. old smiled very sweetly (which made me quite angry) and listened quietly and patiently till I stopped talking, then she and her sister went on riding as before, standing up. Then the 16 yr. old rode sitting down and I rode along on the back of her bike. We came to a place in which the sidewalk was uneven. There seemed to be a difference of only a couple of inches in the height of the 2 slabs of concrete, but when I looked down, it seemed like a canyon. I was frightened. Interpretation The 16 yr. old does have the annoying habit of smiling sweetly, listening and then doing just as she pleases. I had given her some skirts of mine that were too short. She tried them on and I gave her one I had particularly liked. I remember she smiled as I told her how much I had liked it. She took it with the others and had her mother return it to me the next day which made me angry. Often I've thought she and her sister are really little girls trying to act more adult.

I felt happy to have so many friends and that so many people said hello and wanted me to recognize them. I was busy at the entrance table making out name tags. I danced, but don't remember with whom. The place was very crowded and the people kept milling around. The only color I can remember from the dream is pale green. Interpretation I actually had been at the W-- Park M-- for a dance the night I had this dream. When I came home, I was anxious to tell my mother about the events of the evening. Before I fell asleep, I reviewed in my mind the dance, who was there, etc. The dream was very realistic and it seemed to me that I was at the dance all over again. But it was not as though it was a repetition. It seemed like the first time I'd been to that dance. The walls of the ballroom were painted pale green. Answers to questions 2. Happy and excited 3.

I felt very badly because I had overwound the watch. I waited a while and then just wound it once and it seemed to work all right again. Then I noticed that it was ticking as it should and the hands indicating minutes and hours were going in the right direction, but, to my horror, the second hand was going counter-clockwise. At this point it was no longer my watch I was observing, but instead, I seemed to be holding a stop watch. Interpretation I had noticed that my own watch was losing time, and it had been on my mind that I should take it to a jeweler to have it repaired. The stop watch was the one that I use at work.

I was absorbed in thought and was quite surprised when I realized how dark it had become. I started back. Then I heard my name being called very softly. I tried to run in the direction of the man's voice (I did not recognize the voice.) Just as I seemed to be getting closer to the voice, it stopped and came from another direction. I started to run again; each time I thought I was near the source of the voice, it came from another direction. Then I was running about wildly. My clothes and hair were being blown about by the wind. I was sweating profusely and wiped my face on my forearm as I ran. Soon, I became frightened and exhausted. I sat down on a rock and cried and cried. When I raised my head from my arms, it was black out and I couldn't see anything. The voice stopped while I was crying.

My duty was to hold the patients down during their convulsions immediately after the shock was administered. The doctors and nurses I worked with were in the dream. The patients' faces were not too clear. The dream was very real in that it seemed I could actually feel the waves of muscular contractions of the patients as I leaned on them. The preparations were very clear. I saw the nurse applying the electrode jelly, put on the rubber head-band and insert the mouth gag. I remember feeling very upset and I also felt sympathetic towards the patients. Interpretation It was the first time I'd helped with treatments and I was quite impressed; thought about it all afternoon. me dream was complete and real in every detail. Answers to questions 2.

The wedding was complete with flowers, candles and attendants. There were 3 bridesmaids (girlfriends of mine, ages 20-22). The faces of the ushers and the groom were not clear--like a blur.

I turned the dial to start the test when I heard a strangled cry from the patient. I looked at him and saw, to my horror, that there were little blue and yellow streaks (like lightning) coming out of the scalp at the place where each electrode was attached. The patient writhed around and his face began to turn red. I became very excited and did not know what to do. I remember that the tears were running down my face and I was crying aloud as I started turning dials and pushing buttons in an effort to cut off the current. Interpretation The day before, I had a patient who said he felt like Frankenstein when I put all the electrodes on him.

All the stores were closed. (This did not seem unnatural; it must have been Sunday.) As I looked in one store, I saw a woman putting hats into a drawer. As we passed, she looked up and I was surprised to recognize her. (We had lived on the same street for 10 years.) I have not seen her for 2 years. She beckoned to us to stop. Then she opened the door and let us in. We talked and she told me she was selling Bissell carpet sweepers and could get us a good discount. Mother said to me confidentially that maybe she ought to buy a Bissell at a discount instead of the electric sweeper she had been wanting. I remember that all the while we were talking, I kept looking at her and thinking how attractive she had become. Interpretation It's so mixed up, I can't understand it. The girl had been very unattractive--had a severe case of excema on face, arms, and legs and neck. We already have both a Bissell and an electric sweeper. Answers to questions 2.

"0525"	"None"	"(Code 071, Age 20, 11/23/47) I was in a shoe store. There were some empty seats, but I did not sit down. Instead, I walked near the rear of the store and waited for someone, the manager or a salesman to notice me. There were 4 seats, similar to the ones for giving shoe shines--There were 2 facing each way (in other words, they were back to back). There were 2 boys sitting in the 2 raised chairs facing me. I did not know the boy farthest from me. The closer one (approximate age 25), I recognized as a boy with whom I'd double dated several times. Then as I was about to say hello to him he stood up and his face changed. I recognized him as another fellow I know (approximate age 20) who had been badly burned in a fire about 5 weeks ago. I knew his face had been burned. When I remembered this fact, I noticed that his face changed. The hairline changed too and I noticed that near the face, the hair was thin and short. I thought that this was because it probably had been burned away and was just starting to grow back. I called his name and he smiled at me. Interpretation I can understand why I dreamed about these 2 people. I had just heard some interesting news about them the day before. But I cannot understand the symbolism.

I remained silent, but was inwardly seething. Finally, I could contain myself no longer. I rose and made a fervent speech. I was very excited and practically shouted. In my speech, I told the girls I was resigning from the sorority. Then, as I spoke I calmed down a bit and reminded the girls that in the initiation, the president told us that one of the key pearls in our pin stood for cooperation. I reminded them how very uncooperative and inconsiderate they had been about the barn dance. The two girls who had been particularly nasty began to weep--begged me not to resign. Then all the girls chimed in and I began to sway my opinion. When the dream ended though, I was still undecided. Interpretation The night before my dream, my sorority was supposed to hold a barn dance, but the weather was bad, roads dangerous. We met at S's house. Then began a discussion that finally led to an argument as to whether we should stay in town and have a party (which could have easily been arranged) or travel 30 miles to camp in dangerous weather to have the dance. As a result all except 3 couples went to camp. I was one of those who stayed in town. We were all quite aggravated and upset because of the way things turned out. I didn't argue, but the juvenile exhibition of temper tantrums put on by some of the others made me feel ashamed in front of my date. Answers to questions 2.

She knew so little happiness and died so young that I was utterly bereaved. Interpretation I spoke with R. on the phone that day--she told me how disgusted she was with her life. She had seen so much unhappiness. Her sister died of cancer, one just became divorced and her parents separated a month previously. She decided that she would never marry, that her life had no real meaning. I felt terribly sorry for her. She so seldom smiled from real joy--her usual expression is one of dissatisfaction or disgust. Maybe my dream indicates that I subconsciously thought she was better off dead. Answers to questions 2.

I handed her one slip after another; each time, she handed the slip back after looking on some shelves or in some card file with the report that that journal was in use or couldn't be located. I gave her about 12 slips in all. I felt like crying. I turned away from the desk in utter despair, all choked up. Interpretation Several times when I had gone to the library, I had had to wait as long as 15 or 20 minutes to be helped and then would give them 4 or 5 slips before they could find me anything I needed. It had been on my mind that I must keep going to the library every spare moment I had in order to finish the paper on time. Answers to questions None"
"0529"	"None"	"(Code 071, Age 20, 12/16/47) I dreamed I was working in a hospital for the mentally ill. The dream was not definite on this point, but I believe I was working there and the doctors asked me to pretend that I was a patient to get some information about one of the women patients. I did this. We were in a ward. A large room with pillars in it and it had a marble floor. I was in a regular hospital bed next to the bed of the woman I was to observe. Her bed was similar to mine, except that hers had a cage-like affair over it so she couldn't get out. There was a trap door on it and it was of wooden posts with copper screening over all. We were talking and I was frightened at being a patient in such a place and petrified of this woman. She was pale and had large, boring eyes and stringy brown hair. She spoke to me and confided in me and I sympathized with her. I pretended I was a mental case, too, and told her I wished I were dead. Then, I saw her strong, powerful arms reach up and open the trap door on the cage over her bed. She said she'd take care of my body after I was dead. I knew she was going to strangle me. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My fear was overpowering. Then, I saw a nurse coming towards me (this nurse I recognized as the receptionist nurse I work with). The woman's (patient's) hands closed the trap door and she got back into her bed. Then, I fell back on my bed, my heart was pounding and I was weak. I wanted to cry. This nurse (who didn't wear a cap) and another nurse (unknown to me) wheeled my bed out and into another room. They said I had a one o'clock patient that I had to give an electroencephalogram test--then after I gave the test, I was to go back to the ward and keep pretending I was a patient. I was terrified. I said if that woman patient should see me in uniform and recognize me as a worker not a patient she'd kill me (I knew she'd strangle me) I became almost hysterical. What would I do? Then the dream ended as the 2 nurses wheeled my bed back to the ward. I was to stay there till one o'clock--time to do the test, etc. When I was back in the ward, I was weak and frightened. I lay there, opened my eyes and saw the woman staring at me, her eyes boring into me, suspicion written on her face and I lost all hope. I knew she'd kill me. Interpretation Can't interpret. The receptionist is a good friend to me. In the dream, she saved me from death. This may show how much I think of her and of her loyalty to me. I thought the doctor's place very unwise--for me to do the EEG test and then go back to the ward--it placed me in such danger. This may show that often I do not approve of all the things the doctors tell me to do and think their plans sometimes aren't too wise. Answers to questions 2. Extreme fear, helplessness 3.

Dr. G-- (about 30) came into the room with an enormous hypodermic in his hand. He gave me an injection in my right arm. He stood by to see what effect the injection would have on me. I became more and more drowsy. Soon I became aware that Danny Kaye was singing ""Anatole of Paris."" The record repeated itself over and over again. I wanted desperately to get up and turn off the record. But I could not lift my arms or legs. I could not even make my eyelids go up--as much as I wanted to open my eves. Even though my eyes were closed I knew the doctor was still standing at my side. Interpretation This doctor gave me an album of Danny Kaye records for an Xmas gift. My favorite record in the album was ""Anatole of Paris."" This doctor (whom I work with) had also given me an injection about a week previous to the dream when I didn't feel well while at work.

As I went up the hill, I was wondering why there were no curtains. Then I went inside. There was a man (about middle-aged) who lived in this house. He was very ominous-looking. He had dark hair and a heavy mustache. Many young girls (about 20 years of age) lived in this house. The man seemed to dominate all the girls. He painted all the time. Maybe he used the girls as models. They would do whatever he said. The man reminded me of Orson Welles. The furniture in this house was oversized--extremely large. I disliked the man intensely. Interpretation I was reading Jane Eyre in bed before I went to sleep. Orson Welles played the part of Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre, the movie. The house and the man are reminiscent of Jane Eyre.

Finally, I realized it-was dark. I could see no lights. It was absolute blackness. I felt my way along the street. My home had one tiny light in the window. When I reached the house I saw that the dog was sitting on the porch. She recognized my footsteps and barked joyously and wagged her tail. I was furious with the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat her. She squealed and finally bit my hand. I began to cry and threw myself on the couch holding my bitten hand and crying. I was sorry I'd lost my temper and beaten the dog. Interpretation The dog often does run away. She had run away from my brother that evening. He doesn't punish the dog though. Many times, I feel like punishing the dog but don't because of my brother. I was glad the dog bit me. I deserved it for beating her. If I'd watched her more closely she wouldn't have run off. Answers to questions 2. Extreme anger, sorrow and relief 3. Participant 4. 5. 6.

I was wearing 2 white orchids. I felt on the verge of tears. My mother was weeping bitterly. My dad and brother were sad too, but they didn't carry on so. The whistle blew. I knew it was our last chance to board the ship. I couldn't make up my mind. I looked at my mother and then at my husband trying to decide. Finally, I put my arms around my mother and kissed her good-bye. Then, I turned to my husband who put his arm around me and we slowly walked up the gangplank. At first, I tried to keep the tears back then I broke down and cried and cried. Interpretation My mother actually is unhappy that I should consider marrying this boy (the one who was my husband in the dream) because when he graduates he will go abroad for a couple of years. My mother opposed the marriage because she doesn't want me to live in another country, or even in another city. I am still undecided, though. We had been discussing this before I went to sleep.

We were driving to a party in a suburb of C--. It was snowing outside. Finally, after we got to the house, I went in and took off my coat. The house was crowded and was thick with smoke. I sat down on a maroon sofa. No one else was sitting on it. Then the hostess walked over and handed me a glass. It looked like ginger ale but I suspected there was liquor in it and did not taste the drink. Someone else came over and introduced Dr. --- to me. (This is a person I had been dating, but hadn't seen in 2 months; was quite depressed.) I looked up. It was the same person, yet he didn't look the same. He wasn't as handsome. He sat down on a chair next to the sofa and was toying with his drink. His sleeves were up a little and I could see he had hairy arms. We conversed. But he had a know-it-all attitude, was curt and abrupt and almost rude. A smile was on his lips all the time. Then everyone seemed to dissolve and there was just the 2 of us. He put down his drink, sat down next to me on the sofa. I knew he was going to kiss me. Then he put his arms around me. I was expectant. When he did kiss me I pushed him away. I didn't like it and I didn't like him any more. I knew then that he had never had any true love for me and had merely been leading me on. I saw him then for what he really was. Interpretation I had been thinking of him for some time. I had thought I was in love with him. Everyone told me he didn't really care for me but I couldn't believe it. Recently, I met someone else who was so fine and considerate I couldn't help comparing the 2 men. This dream was a sign to me that I shouldn't waste my time thinking of him any more.

"0535"	"None"	"(Code 074, Age 20, 02/17/47) I was in a ten-cent store, one that I was familiar with, except that I noticed one counter was misplaced--the comb counter. I was shopping for decorations and little nonsense gifts for a party. There was a man with me but he had no definite features rather like a shadow. The salesgirls were all very enthused about a book that had arrived that day with ideas on what to do with lace and fringe. One of the girls or I should say a middle aged, tall, emaciated woman had on a black kimono and was trying a pink net shawl over this in different ways. I told her to sew it instead of pinning it. I then proceeded to buy my gifts. I tried to get some balloons but was unable to get the color that I wanted. I next stopped at the comb counter to get a good strong comb but the selection was poor and the only ones that were left were too flexible. Interpretation The day after I had this dream I was supposed to go to the ten cent store to get decorations for a party. This is the only explanation that I can give. Answers to questions 2. I seemed rather indifferent to any emotion. 3. I felt more like an onlooker as though I were watching the salesgirls. 4. On the whole it was pleasant. 5. No 6.

"0536"	"None"	"(Code 074, Age 20, 02/19/47) At first I was in my own living room. The whole family was sitting around. My aunt who is about forty said something to me and the next thing I knew I was standing in front of a large brick and stucco house that looked Austrian in appearance. A little boy was knocking on the door, suddenly he turned and threw a snowball at another little boy standing next to me, the snowball hitting him on the head. The next thing I knew I was on the second floor of this house. Seated around the room were some Austrians in their native costumes, drinking beer. On one side of the room were three or four very close friends of mine. Some very competent people were setting up apparatus for a radio program. I noticed a plump, blond girl specially. After this I found myself setting up laboratory equipment. A tall boy with glasses was working my experiment for me. We were working with a poisonous solution which constantly foamed and boiled over. Suddenly this boy dropped whatever he was holding, gave a yell, went into convulsions, and fell to the floor hitting his head on a board. I went back to my experiment and noticed the boy get up, take a blanket and went upstairs with the appearance of having known exactly what had happened. Interpretation Two days before I had this dream, I was looking through a Life magazine and saw a picture of some Austrians in their native costume drinking beer. It may be significant that our house is brick and stucco but aside from this I have no interpretation. Answers to questions 2. I felt very sure of myself 3. I actually participated in the dream but I felt like an onlooker. 4. On the whole it was interesting not necessarily pleasant or unpleasant. 5. No 6.

The child was about two years old and had dark curly hair. As we walked along we stopped into each house along the way to receive what might be called little hand-outs. The child was getting tired and I began skipping houses. By the time we got to the school I was carrying the child in a knapsack hanging on my left shoulder. The next thing I remember I was on my own street. There was a garden party on our front lawn and all the neighbors were gathered. I was told to go down the street to deliver something to a house which was five houses from a house I knew well, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it. Interpretation The two year old child fits the description of my little cousin. The knapsack on my left shoulder was probably the over-shoulder bag which I wear on that shoulder.

It belonged to a newly married couple. The wife had just finished setting the table for company. There were no doors or windows in the house, merely places where they should have been. The house looked like it had been struck by fire. In fact there was a woman around the age of thirty-two who was standing in the corner and ironed. She said that there had been a fire that day, but that she had to finish ironing the little girl's dress. We all left the house when the guests began to arrive. The next scene was in a garage where I was with a boy my own age who was trying to get the car in a tight parking place. Interpretation The woman in the dream is a friend of the family's who has a little girl. The fire situation probably has its basis in the fact that my uncle was killed in the L---- Hotel fire last year and it has left quite a mark on me. Answers to questions 2. I felt indifferent 3.

They were painting it gray but were having a difficult time getting the right shade. Five friends of the husband came in and offered to help.

We rushed to the auditorium and there we saw some old friends. I remember one very distinctly. He was a boy who went to high school with us. Now he goes to Harvard. In a Bostonian accent, I told this to my friends. They all smiled knowingly. I noticed that the Harvard boy was wearing a white tie and tails. He was a member of the local band. The show began and the announcer said that this was a special show with many acts. The first act was that three girls from the audience should come to the stage and each sit next to some boy and they would be married. It turned out that we were the three girls. I was the first one to walk down the aisle. I sat down next to a boy named Douglas and we were married. After the marriage, I left him and wondered if it were true. I then woke up.

I remember this walk very distinctly for it was very rugged. I remember where there used to be steps, these were now just a rolling mass of mud with a steel ridge on either side. You could either walk on the ridge or slide up the mud. There were other obstacles, too, such as high walls and waterfalls. It was a very long walk which seemed to take hours, but I at last reached the top. When I got there, I was shoved into a room with many others. There was a man there discussing posture. He looked at me and seemed very happy. He picked on me immediately, saying I was bowlegged. I listened and listened to him. At the end of his long speech, a very fat woman tried to help me by saying, ""You must be very still while in bed."" Then I said that I knew I was bowlegged and that my mother tried using braces on my legs but nothing helped them. However, I was taking a Body Mechanics course at Reserve and they had promised that that would help me. Everybody looked relieved and I woke up. Interpretation This dream was very interesting in that so many things were true. I am a little bowlegged and have tried many different ways to overcome it. Although my mother never put braces on my legs, she has told me that they are doing it now with young children. Another queer thing is that I am taking the course in Body Mechanics given here at Reserve.

My mother, however, was no longer there. She had vanished all of a sudden. I ran to the back of the bus and looked in. She was in the bus, so I ran to the front and got in. When I got in, my mother was standing outside waiting for me, and I saw a person running to get the bus, yelling at my mother. The peculiar part of this was that I was the person who was running. I then woke up. Interpretation I feel that the continual running had something to do with the fact that I am trying to get ads for the Reserve Tribune. I have been doing this for several weeks now with not a great deal of success, although I did accumulate a few ads. When I would get to an establishment, the answer would often be that the person would have to advertise all over if they advertised with the Tribune, and this would be too expensive.

When I actually woke up from this ringing sensation, the phone was silent.

This record was blue on one side and pink on the other side. I remember that the record fit into the victrola just as an impression fits into a person's mouth. I felt very nauseated. I insisted, however, upon the black, flat records, and finally bought them and walked out of the store. Interpretation As far as records are concerned, we just got a new victrola and have purchased some new records. Last week, the dentist took impressions of my lower and upper teeth.

Some man grabbed the monkey's tail, and also was carried down the street. He was trying to protect the terrified girl. We all thought it was a big joke until we saw that the man had caught his tie in a washing machine, and couldn't get loose. The girl in the meantime was having a bad way with the monkey. I rushed to the washing machine and tried to find the handle to turn it off, but this was difficult because of the great deal of newspaper that were covering the machine. The man looked very sick, but he found the handle and turned it off. At this point, my alarm went off. Interpretation I have no idea why I dreamed of monkeys, but as far as the washing machine is concerned, I think I can find some relationship.

This person combed and combed and still more dandruff fell. Another man suggested that he use a special comb devised to get rid of dandruff. The comb was hollow, and when dipped in some oil, it would retain the oil for several days, and a person's hair would never get dry if he used this comb. Dryness was the cause of dandruff. So this man, who seemed to be me and yet was not me, bought the comb and asked for a haircut. The barber said, however, that they didn't cut hair there. We ran out of the shop. I now seem to be myself and the man is someone else. Interpretation The day before the dream I had combed my hair in many styles to see which pleased me the most.

We argued for quite a while and then decided to each go our own way. My aunt and I then went to the ticket office to get the tickets, but there weren't any left for the six o'clock so we decided to wait for cancellations. The manager told us we were tenth in line waiting for cancellations. We waited and waited. At last, we decided it was futile, and we asked for tickets for the 8:30 show. However, there were none left for that show either. I felt very angry with my brother. I felt it was all his fault. I was brooding when my alarm went off. Interpretation The Wednesday before the dream I had just seen ""Harvey"" at the H-. I enjoyed the play very much. The peculiar thing about the dream was that we had just managed to get tickets about an hour before the performance. The last week or two, I have been arguing with my brother a great deal about a certain matter. The idea that I was at the H-- with him was absurd, because I never go anywhere with him.

When the assembly was over, he stood up and said to his friend, who was sitting next to him, that I was his wife. When we started taIking, he asked me for a date. I accepted, and as we were about to leave, a man fell dead on the stage. We rushed to the stage and crowded around the man. The man turned out to be another friend of mine. When I turned around to look at my husband (I accepted him my husband now), he was grinning from ear to ear, and I was very angry. Interpretation The boy had an odd resemblance to my brother. Since I have been thinking about him lately, it seems quite logical that he should come up in my dreams. He is very boyish and grins a good deal. My angry attitude may be directed toward my brother, and comes out unconsciously in my dreams. Answers to questions 2. Happy, perplexed, angry 3. Participant 4. Both 5. Auditorium 6. No 7. No colors"

I said that I didn't care for his history book at all and that I thought history was boring. Everybody disagreed with me. It seemed as if we walked for quite a long time still discussing Mr. Becker and his history book. I remember saying that I enjoyed casebooks much better. Interpretation All afternoon, I had been reading the Casebook of American Business History by Gras and Larson, and I remember thinking how terribly boring it was, but I had to finish it because it was a history assignment.

I then thought to myself that I might be at the wrong party. I was very confused and embarrassed. I realized that I didn't know my hostess and that I had to hurry out of the house. I ran for hours till I finally got to the right party. Interpretation The idea of the bridge party seems very real since I was actually invited to a party of that kind the following Sunday. I had also planned on wearing my blue suit. Why I should confuse about the party, I can't understand except for the fact that I never could understand why the girl that invited me should all of a sudden think of me when we had so little in common and didn't see each other very much.

I was very surprised to see them, and very embarrassed that they should see my messy room. I, however, was very happy to see them and told them to unpack their clothes immediately, and I would help them. I hung all their clothes in the attic, which seemed a long distance from the main part of the house. They, however, were thrilled with the attic. We all got dressed up that evening, for I was going to have a party that night. My father then came in and I introduced him to the girls. Then six sailors in their white uniforms rushed in and made a dash for the piano. They wore overseas caps. About a half hour later, six more sailors with different kinds of caps rushed in and started singing around the piano. The girls were having a marvelous time. Interpretation The three guests in my dream were the girls that I'm expecting over the Thanksgiving vacation. I have been thinking of them quite a bit and thinking of all the ways I can entertain them. I probably have been thinking of it so much, that in my dreams, the entertainment has become quite fantastic. The men around the piano reminded me of Mumble's (Dick Tracy column) quartet.

I seemed to be an outsider, but no one noticed me. I had a feeling there were people of many countries there. Interpretation Before I went to sleep, I thought of the person I had asked for stunt night. He is majoring in international politics. I thought of myself as the wife of a foreign diplomat.

He barked just as loud as ever and looked black and shiny as before. I could hardly believe he was alive. Interpretation Our dog died Friday morning, November 28th and we all felt pretty bad about it. We had him since he was three weeks old and he died at the age of l4 years. Although he was old, he died more of pneumonia than anything else, I think. He had a bad cough that sounded as if he was choking. We asked the veterinarian about it and he told us to give the dog cough medicine. We did this, but I still have a guilty conscience that I didn't do enough to make him well.

The lady said that I would have to be with my mother during that hour, and, consequently, could not go to school the rest of that year. I felt pretty bad about that, but was willing to do anything for my mother. Interpretation I met a girl a couple of weeks ago who told me about the electric treatment at H_____'s for reducing.

As we ran around inside the house to see if anyone was there, we found that every door was closed to every room, but nothing in any room was disturbed. Interpretation Since I have had a few dreams about our dog C--, who died of pneumonia last month, I feel that it is a sort of guilt feeling about his death. C-- was pretty sick before he died and although we did give him medicine and tried to heIp him, I think we could have done more for him. I foolishly washed him about a week before he died.

I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me. Interpretation This was a very peculiar dream. The only incident which seemed plausible was the fact that I was wondering why the boy in the dream didn't call me up. He had discussed doctors when I had seen him last because he recently had an appendix operation. I can't understand how the ice-skating got into the dream. Answers to questions 2. Anxious, perplexed, frustrated, disgusted 3. Participant 4. Unpleasant 5. My mansion home (not my own) and walking to the pond 6. Never before 7. No colors"
"0569"	"None"	"(Code 074, Age 20, 01/05/48) I had just washed my hair and set it. In a few minutes, it was dry and was combing it out. It was turning a bright shade of red as I combed it. I always set a deep wave in the front. This time, I did the same, but when I combed it out, the wave wasn't there. I was very sad about this. I tried to comb the wave back in, but the more I combed, the straighter my hair became on top. I was very disgusted and worried. Interpretation This dream seems rather absurd, but I do take great pains in washing and setting my hair. The evening before the dream, I had washed my hair, and it always seems to have a reddish cast after I wash it. I love clean, well-set hair, and it's always made my feel good when my hair looks good.

"0570"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 09/25/47) I dreamt that our cleanlng woman, about 50, who has come into our home for many years, was late in finishing her work, because she was sharpening needles in order to listen to the records of the Roman Catholic Mass. I was helping her sharpen the needles, as I was worried that the woman was working overtime. I seem to remember that the time was 4:35 and her quitting time is 4:00. All through this dream, I had the feeling that time was running out, and that I had to hurry. My parents were around somewhere, too, but I don't remember anything else about them in connection with the dream. Interpretation We are studying drama connected with the Roman Catholic church service and had a great deal of materlal to cover for Frlday, the day after my dream. I felt a bit unprepared for the lesson and knew that I would have no more time available to prepare the lesson further-this might explain the time running out feeling I experienced. Previously this week, I had discussed Catholicism with someone mentioning the beauty of the music connected with the Mass. Our cleaning woman is Catholic and very devout, probably that is why she appeared in the dream. Answers to questions 2. I was anxious about the time. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Centered around the automatic radio-phonograph combination. 6. No 7. only the color of the radio-phonograph--brown."
"0571"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 09/26/47) I was helping in my dad's store, (as is my custom when the benevolent spirit moves me), when a rather tall man, about 40, came in accompanied by a woman. He carried a package which he wanted to mail at our sub-station. He opened the package and showed me two letters which were enclosed. One letter had a three cent stamp on it, the other was unstamped. He asked me for a penny stamp. I told him this was unnecessary. He insisted however, so I went to the stamp drawer and brought him a penny stamp. The woman with him was about thirty or so, and related in some way, but not his wife. Interpretation Several weeks ago, I meant to ask whether letters could be in packages but forgot. This might mean my question was cropping up again. Answers to questions 2. I really didn't experience any emotions at all. It seemed like an ordinary occurrence. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Our drug store 6. No 7. The three-cent stamp was purple or lavender colored and the penny stamp was green. I definitely remember that."
"0572"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 09/27/47) I was walking past John Hay High School when a teacher, about 60, whose class I had observed the day before, walked out of the building. She carried a pair of scissors and started to cut a bouquet of lovely autumn flowers. I remember orange marigolds, yellow chrysanthemums, and red flowers of one type. She held up the bouquet and I admired it. Strangely enough there were carrots included in the assortment of flowers. She offered me a carrot and I ate it. When I returned home I found that someone had sent a bouquet of flowers and this surprised me. Interpretation This is rather difficult to interpret. But recently I bought a bouquet of flowers for my parents' wedding anniversary and another bouquet was brought by relatives. This might be a repetition in a different form. Carrots are associated with a friend who eats them all the time. I recently stopped seeing this boy, and wonder for awhile whether or not this is the best course to follow. Answers to questions 2. I was a bit surprised at seeing carrots and at finding a bouquet at home. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. First in front of the high school, then the living room. 6. No 7. The flower colors were very vivid--orange, yellow, red--and carrots were orange too."
"0573"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/06/47) I dreamt I was out riding with my cousin, age 40 and his wife, about 30. We rode along for sometime and finally a huge amusement park of some sort came into view. The place looked tremendously attractive. The buildings were painted in beautiful bright blues and reds. There were numerous neon lights radiating about. The above description makes the place sound rather garish but really there was a certain unique charm about it and we decided to stop there for awhile. It seems that I had heard something about this place before and from the conversation of my cousin it was apparent that it was very well known. When we entered I felt that I had once been here before, yet, I know of no actual place like it. We entered some sort of building which had a restaurant in one half and a photo studio in the other. A rather nondescript girl, employed at the studio, was showing us samples of their work in photography. The girl was rather young about my age, I imagine. The pictures were mostly bridal pictures. I can't remember anything else. Interpretation The riding part might be wishful thinking. Now that the beautiful autumn scenery is coming into view, I wished more than once that I might go out riding to see it. I can't interpret the amusement park but we were Just discussing interesting new places to go to last week. I remember looking at bridal pictures the day before as we passed a studio. Answers to questions 1. I was surprised to see the amusement nark loom up out of nowhere. That's about all the emotion. 3. Actual participant 4. Pleasant 5. The setting was this created amusement park and the interior of one of the buildings. 6. No 7. Very conscious of the red and blue buildings and there seems to have been green somewhere too. The scene of the park before entering was one splash of brilliant colors."
"0574"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/07/47) I dreamt that I was walking to a class through M-- arch and noticed that a funeral home was located at the same place that M-- House is actually. This place had large glass windows and looking in from the sidewalk where I was, I noticed that a funeral was just ending. The mourners were slowly advancing to the front of the room where the casket was displayed. The corpse was a fair-haired woman about 40 or so, dressed in a black gown. I never saw the face before. Some of the mourners were weeping as they approached the casket. I remembered to myself that I had never seen a dead person and was rather curious to see this one. That seems to be all. Interpretation I really can't find anything to relate this to. It might be just a rehashing of stray thoughts about the nearness of funeral homes to the campus. A friend of the family died recently but he was a man. I didn't attend the funeral either. But it might have to do with this association nevertheless. Answers to questions 2. Curiosity was about all 3. Onlooker 4. Neither 5. Setting was the walk leading from the archway of the M-- campus. Scene was the super-imposed funeral home. 6. No. But I have had other dreams from time to time dealing with someone's death. 7. Not that I can remember. Except the blonde hair of the woman."
"0575"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/08/47) I remember being out on a date with another couple. I can't remember who my escort was or who the other girl was with. I know her rather casually, having once doubled with her several months back. She is about 20. We were sitting around a table at some restaurant or other. She asked me what type of man I wanted to marry. I proceeded to tell her and she asked me first of all what height I preferred in a man. I answered 5' 10 "". Then she asked about preferred hair coloring. I really had no preference but after she suggested dark hair I agreed that I too preferred men with dark hair. She intimated that she was tired of most of the men she knew, especially the tall, dark and handsome variety. Interpretation Just the day before, I had been sitting at a table with two friends from A--, and they had spoken of the type of girl they wanted to marry. They too had specified height and hair color but also went on to more significant traits of personality, home background, religion etc. Answers to questions 2. I really felt no emotions at all 3.

"0576"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47) I dreamt that my parents were planning a dinner party for 7:00. Preparations were not yet completed when the doorbell rang and our guests arrived. They were a middle-aged doctor and his wife, actual friends of ours. Mother was dressed in a black and white checked dress and in general the house was in an uproar. We seated our guests at a small table for two. There were two other large tables. one of these tables was occupied by Mother and Dad and several other relatives whom I can't remember. I too, sat with them. The third table was occupied by a group of unknowns, among whom were two girls who had been called to serve that evening. We proceeded with our meal and serving was done in a very inefficient manner. We had chicken, some sort of potatoes and green peas which were dished out into small plates. It seemed to take ages until all the tables were served from the central table where we sat. I kept thinking there wouldn't be enough to go around. Our two guests conversed continually with one another. I noticed that the table was littered with empty ginger ale bottles and told the two girls to clear them away. Interpretation This might be the aftermath of a week ago, when I was chairman of a large social gathering. The amount of food we ought to order, the type of serving that was to be done, and all such matters played on my mind for a long time. All went well, but the food almost did run out. Also, this evening the doorbell rang before I expected my date and not being ready, I was rather perturbed. This might have some connection with the early arrival of our dinner guests. I couldn't begin to explain this dream symbolically, but I suppose it has deeper connotations. Answers to questions 2. I was a bit anxious 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. Our living room which had all the furniture removed and only these three tables 6. No 7. The color of the peas was light green"
"0577"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47) I dreamt that a group of us, M-- students, were sitting around in a room in a building on the M-- campus. What this building is I don't really know. I had a vague impression that it was a room in the library, yet this particular place doesn't actually exist. While we were speaking with one another, an old woman, who looked well over 80, came into the room accompanied by a middle-aged woman attendent. The aged woman was dressed in a vivid lavender dress and had striking white hair. Her face was quite lined, and after she left one of the girls mentioned the fact that part of her face was paralyzed. I hadn't noticed this. Before the two women left, they glanced for sometime about the room. Then the oldest woman said, to one of the girls, ""Do you know who I am?"" The girl replied in the negative, and the woman told her that she was Mrs. H-- who had donated the money for the building we were in. She didn't reveal that she was the donor, but we all knew that she was. She had come to look around before she died, and was pleased to see that all was well here. Then she departed with her companion. Interpretation The only connection that I ran make out is that a short time ago I saw several regal dowagers walking through the campus and I somehow imagined them to be donors of one sort or another. Perhaps the old woman is a grandmother symbol. I remember feeling very kindly toward her, as I might toward my grandmother. Answers to questions 2. Surprise at the identity of the old woman 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. An unidentified room in one of the buildings on the M-- campus 6. No 7. The vivid lavender of the woman's dress."
"0578"	"None"	"(Code 078, Age 21, 10/24/47) I dreamt that I met a middle-aged man in S-- S-- who had a most precocious little boy, about three years old. The little boy, who was blonde and blue-eyed was amazingly intelligent. I don't remember our conversation at all, but I do know that this child had almost a mature adult mind. The rapid transit came and the father and the child, along with an older son, about 12 or so boarded it. I went along too. While we rode I was conscious of the steel tracks in front of us and also was aware of the tremendous danger of rolling off the tracks when the rapid made its many turns. The motorman seemed to be aware of this danger too because he went very slowly and mentioned the danger of the slippery steel tracks which gleamed in the sun. The bright little boy sat with his older brother in front of the father. I sat next to the proud parent who gave me a further account of the prodigy. Interpretation This dream may be a rehashing of some of the discussions in our education classes about the brilliant child. At the present time, I am more than ever conscious of little children, partly because of a Sunday School class which I have in which there are many bright youngsters about 6 years of age. Parents very frequently discuss their children with me. Because of the fact that the teaching field is new to me, I do have some apprehensions about dealing with some of the problems. This may explain the fear of going off the tracks. Answers to questions 2. Apprehensive of the rapid going off the tracks 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. First S-- S--, then the rapid itself. 6. No 7. The youngster had blonde hair and blue eyes and also had pink cheeks. He had a brown coat on."

A large brick building which was some sort of club stood there and I walked down a long walk at the side of the building. I was met by a young man I know, about 35, who escorted me to the porch where another man, about 33 was sitting. Both of these men are friends of mine. They sat together on the porch and when they both glanced at me, I noticed an amazing resemblance in their faces. The younger of the two men then accused me of saying that he looked older than the other one. Their eyes flashed a striking blue when they looked at me. That is all that I remember of the dream. Interpretation I had remarked to someone that the younger man did look older. These men do not know each other and there is no connection at all in associating them, except their proximity of age. I had never noticed their physical resemblance before seeing them in the dream. Answers to questions 2. I was surprised at the resemblance and the accusation. 3. Actual participant 4. Neither 5. The porch of the supposed club. 6. No 7. Only the brilliant blue of the eyes."

I had a temporary anxiety that another drug store would move in here. Someone assured me that this wasn't true. A C-- restaurant was located not far away from where we were. We were glad that a clean eating place was close at hand. My parents and I went there for a meal. That is all I remember. Interpretation Friends of ours have a store on the west side. We often wish that there were a good restaurant near our present store. That is all I can make of this dream. Answers to questions 2. Generally interested in the surroundings and surprised. 3.

She had been murdered at the country club. While I walked down a corridor, another girl was murdered by a knife which someone threw. I began to be terrified. A young, tall blonde man about 25 or so, offered to take me home. He said that I ought to wait while he ordered a taxi. Finally he returned and we made our way out of the place. A middle-aged man was crouchlng before a blue smoky blaze and he mumbled and chanted in a loud voice. I understood that the murdered girl had been cremated and these were her last remains. Suddenly, the man came toward me, as if to kill me, too. Just as he came close enough to touch me, I awoke. Interpretation Perhaps this is a rehashing of the recent assault crimes which have been plastered across all of the newspapers. It might also reflect insecurity of one sort or another. Answers to questions 2. Terror and fear 3. Actual participant 4. Unpleasant 5. The country club (unknown) 6. No 7. yes, especially the brilliant blue smoke. Something else was brilliant red, but I don't remember what it was."

I dashed to a little powder room, where I combed my hair and returned to the gathering. I was aware that had a Sunday school class to teach. When I entered the Sunday School room, someone else had taken over. I was very grateful and looked at my watch. We only had about five more minutes before dismissal.

I got up and tendered my resignation from the stunt nite chorus, that I am in. I told them I was too busy to take on all of the many hours of rehearsals ahead. They accepted my resignation. I felt just a trifle sorry for having backed out. I regretted this action quite strongly. Then I woke up-- Interpretation This is worry over getting everything done within the next few weeks.

I broke up with him about eight months ago because I wasn't interested in marrying him. He appeared very gracious and friendly when I entered. He was working there now, and seemed to be very well liked by the proprietor of the book shop, an older man of about 45, with a moustache. My friend led me to a book shelf and I leafed through several books. I had in mind the fact that my friend was now engaged to another girl and felt glad that he had found someone else. That is all I remember. Interpretation This is a jumble of many things--first of all, my friend is now engaged and his future father-in-law is very fond of him. The proprietor of the book store might represent this. Next, I sometimes catch a glimpse of this young man and he appears very friendly and without any ill feeling toward me. I can't find any significance to the book store, except that several years ago I worked in one for awhile. Answers to questions 2. I was surprised to see him there. 3. Actual participant 4.

I tried and tried to get to the faculty room where the sheet was posted but when I finally did, the sheet had been removed to the office. I felt very perturbed because unless I signed it I wouldn't get paid for teaching that Sunday. I don't know why this thought bothered me so much. Interpretation This actually occurred the Sunday before and might be a rehashing of an actual event. It might also be apprehension of one sort or another. Answers to questions 2.

My aunt said she was very disappointed at not seeing me therefore had come down immediately. We had some sort of conversation in which she discussed her children when they were young.

I don't really know who they were--customers probably. I was dressed in a Hawaiian Hula costume and performed a hula dance on the spot, without any feelings of impropriety. An old man, about 75 or so, was looking in at the entrance to the store, and smiling. That is all. Interpretation I have danced in the store several times--but always with someone and not the hula dance!

We went to a very unusual Chinese restaurant--a beautiful large elaborate-looking place--a dream creation. We had dinner in a private dining room which was screened off from the rest of the place by green drapes. The color scheme of the room was yellow and green. That is all I remember. Interpretation This seems like a jumble of previous experiences--I have entered a Chinese restaurant--with private little dining rooms but not with this unknown individual.

The setting of the dream--that is the field--is not familiar to me and I don't think it is any place that I have ever been. Interpretation At this time my life was quite content even though my future was quite uncertain in that I didn't know what I was going to do--in other words--where I was going.

There was a phonograph playing. The boys then announced they were going to pick a queen. It was like a ""hot of the blue."" No one was prepared for it - it was a complete surprise. Nevertheless each of the girls had to take a turn encircling the room. After this announcement some other girls arrived on the scene nicely dressed in their good clothes. All this time I was sitting on the couch watching the others and I woke up before it was my turn to get up. I know I felt very mad when the alarm clock went off and woke me up.

It was a boy (age 22) I had recognized as having been stationed at Ft. while I was there. I only knew him by sight. To my knowledge I was the only graduate nurse in the group so I did what I could to determine the nature of his injury & make him comfortable. However, there was a student nurse present who pushed forward & ""took over the show."" I, more or less submitted & stood by the sidelines. The ambulance & doctor arrived - & transported the boy to the hospital on a plank. The only symptom he seemed to have was a swelling, redness, tautness of the 3rd finger on his left hand. It was believed that he had a spinal injury. The scene changed to a hospital ward. Another nurse (same age) and I were with the patient. The doctor had just left, after arranging some pillows & blankets under the boy's back. Miss D. (32) a supervisor in Nursing arts, with whom I had previously worked came into the room & asked why the pillows had been arranged in such a fashion. She gave me the impression that she thought I was very stupid. Even though we told her that the doctor had arranged them in that manner, she changed them to what she believed was the best and correct way.

I sat talking to Daddy for a long while, however. Then I looked at my watch, saw that it was 7:30 pm, and decided that I had better get the dishes done before I left. I believe as I remember it that I had to be at some special place a little later in the evening. Daddy came out into the kitchen to help me. He got mad when he found out that I had put the remainder of the pie (not in a pie pan but in a bread pan) back into the oven. He said that the crust would get hard & tough. The gas was not on, however, and the door was open. I saw no difference in the outward appearance of the pie. Mother came down then and told us about the exorbitant prices they had charged for food in restaurants on New Year's Eve. I remember only one place & price she quoted. The SSS had charged 35 cents for a dab of mayonnaise and liver paste on a cracker. Interpretation I had not been eating any mayonnaise & liver paste although I like it a lot. The SSS is a restaurant and bar near home (I have been in there only a few times, however that is where the high school crowd hangs out) The food thruout the dream may tie in, in some way with my love for good food.

However, the colored pictures never seemed to stop and I got all the way to the front cover without coming across a single black and white page. I thought it was so strange. Most of the pictures were landscapes and nature studies. The coloring was simply beautiful in all of them.

I also kept seeing the other couple with whom we doubled. They just kept smiling and laughing -- not at us -- they were just enjoying themselves. Interpretation As I said above I did have a date with the same boy I dreamed about - the evening that I dreamed. We did dance practically the whole evening.

My mother was out front and was very disturbed. I left the stage and went backstage where I found a doll. I then thought of a song to sing, the old song ""You Great Big Beautiful Doll.""

There I saw two girl friends of mine sitting in class - taking notes. The boy and I just stood there and watched them take notes. When the class was over one of the girls, who in reality is a tall girl, came over and said ""hello"" to the fella I was with but not to me. Both she and he made me feel very little - in the dream they both seemed about six feet tall or over - which made me feel very small. I was angry when she said ""hello"" to him and not to me. Interpretation I saw this girl friend during Spring Vacation. She in reality does attend O_____ University. After I saw her I thought to myself how nice the fella I date and she would look together because they are both so tall. I am tall myself but I recalled the many times she used to complain of her height -- and said that she never could get a tall enough date. I never cared too much for her - and we haven't gotten together since graduation from high school. I was probably jealous when she said ""hello"" to him & not to me. Answers to questions 2. Angry 3.

I told him at least I was the natural type (I was wearing bobby socks, skirt and sweater) and didn't get dressed up so ""fancy"" for class. As I was talking to him my best friend came down the hall with a fella. He looked exactly like ""E_____"" - but she called him ""P_____."" - The resemblance was amazing. Interpretation That very evening my girl friend was telling me about the date she had with a fella called ""P_____"" - she told me that he was the same type as ""E_____"" - and that they looked very much alike. The part about E_____ wanting to kiss me in front of the girl and others too probably reflects the fact that he always in reality shows his affection for me in public - I dislike this and have told him many times to stop it. I stopped dating him for a few weeks - but I had ""reports"" of the other girls he dated in that time. That probably explains the ""overdressed"" girl in the dream. Answers to questions 2.

As he handed me the flowers he told me that there was a note in the box explaining everything. I started to read the note - but woke up before I got past about two or three words. Interpretation The fella who gave me the two white orchids asked me out for last New Years Eve -- but I refused him as I had another date.

We got to the floor we got out on - by then he was dead.

He's a chronic invalid, & in the dream he was regretting that he could never plan on marriage, because he wanted to marry me. Then I was discussing it with my mother - we both felt very sad about it. I told mother that a man I work with had just proposed to me, & I thought he was congenial & would make a good husband, but was not physically attractive to me, so I refused him--it was rather embarrassing. I wondered if he might have aroused me if I had ever permitted him to make love to me, & said to Mother, ""But if you never try, how do you know?"" Interpretation The first situation is pretty close to reality, except that I go with the boy partly because we both know that he'll not be able to marry me --I doubt if I would be interested.

One of the boys was outside--someone I'd met before--I was almost in hysterics by then & shaking--he took me in his arms and held me, then we sat down & I leaned on his shoulder & after awhile he kissed me gently.

With one part of me I looked on & said calmly, ""This is all foolish,"" but the part of me on the stage stood there--babbling nonsense syllables--& laughing hysterically, & all the people murmured & looked embarrassed for me.

"0661"	"None"	"(Code 102, Age 21, 04/17/48) I was in a very large house, one that I had never been in before. Each room that I went in was different than the one before. The furnishings were in modern style and the colors were bright (mostly green, orange, blue, red). I was amazed at the beauty of the home and the elegance of the furnishings. Suddenly the scene changed. I was at home and the mailman left a package for me. It was my watch strap which I had been waiting a long time for. Interpretation The second part of the dream could be merely a practical wish. My strap is broken and I haven't been able to wear my watch. The first part might be wish fulfillment too.

There were books and magazines all over the place and there was also a library there. The scene changed and I was standing before an easel painting a scene. It was of two houses, one very pretty and the other very old and rather nondescript. Suddenly I decided I wanted to visit the new house so I did. There were people in it, but none of them were familiar to me. I remember looking out over some water (a lake or river). Again I was back in the fraternity house. Someone I knew in the dream evidently (but not in real life) was playing the piano and I was listening. We decided to go down to the recreation room and it wasn't until we went down the steps that I recognized who I was with. He had trouble getting downstairs because he had an artificial leg (age 22). Interpretation The fraternity house is up at C-- and I had recently been up there for a house party. I remember last night that I went to the school library and studied and read a magazine. My girlfriend next door is an artist and I have watched her do oils at different times. The fellow I was with was one whom I used to go out with quite often.

It was beautiful and the colors were gorgeous. My girlfriend and I were in the gas station getting fuel for the car. The station was on a hill. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was in a classroom. I sat down in a chair that had several coats on it. Again the scene changed. It was raining and I was reading the election headlines in the paper. Wallace's name was there, but all I remember was something about rain being mentioned.

I think it was a baseball diamond. So I went over there and found a way in and wandered around awhile. Then I saw there was a large manufacturing plant there.

We passed the auditorium balcony where the rest of the school was having some sort of an assembly. The doors were open and we heard a boy make horrible noises on his accordion.
