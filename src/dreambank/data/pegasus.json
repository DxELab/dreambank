    "description": "Pegasus is a factory worker from the northern Pennsylvania-Ohio area who kept a detailed record of his dreams between 1949 and 1964 because he thought they provided useful clues in picking winners in horse races.  His series is unique because it comes from a person who is both a member of the blue-collar working class and passionate for betting on horses.  Surely no one has recorded dreams for reasons such as his.  For an analysis of some aspects of this dream series by Calvin S. Hall, along with a presentation of the limited information available on Pegasus's waking life, click here."
