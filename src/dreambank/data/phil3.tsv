We leave the resort and are on a bridge high above a very large river, something like the Largo River Bridge in my hometown.  I wonder how deep the water is at that point.  We assume it was deep, and we all dive off.  When we come up, we start swimming back to the resort.  When we get there, it is time to go home.  After I begin to leave, I realize that I have left a towel or something behind, and I go back.  I have to go up some stairs, and when I come down, I see Doug Sterme.  He introduces to me to his son, ""Iran,"" and to his wife, whose name I can't remember, but she is a small Japanese woman with a round face.  I am surprised that his wife is Japanese."

I can barely reach it by standing on my tiptoes, and I am not able to reattach the clip that holds it to the rim, so I get a stepladder.  Then there are a couple of other guys-kids, really, at that same level, and two of them jump to the floor from the top of the stepladder.  It frightens me, because I thought they will hurt themselves, but they don't.  "

There is a regular football at first, but then it shrinks down to a size which is really too small to throw.  So I sit down on a bench with one of my friends and ask if we couldn't borrow one from the Phys Ed department.  He said we could but that it is really cold in there."

What makes me feel uneasy about living in this house is that you can't see it-the entrance, at least-from the outside.  I don't really remember entering it, but every time I leave it, it is via some steps up from something which feels like a storm cellar, and you have to lift sheets of corrugated aluminum above your head.  I begin to have a sad and disappointed feeling about having invested in a house which you can't take pride in from the outside.  "

A mother and her child climb it, though, and at the top is a bed.  I struggle and struggle, getting almost to the top but not having enough strength to pull myself the last few inches needed to get my leg over the top and onto the bed.  Finally I make it, but I am exhausted.  "

On the way there I encounter Gracie Berry, who is going to be in the class.  I am a little embarrassed to have someone I know in the class, particularly a seasoned veteran like Gracie, because whatever the topic of the class is, I know very little about it, and I am not prepared for the first day.  I don't even have a syllabus.  We are also running a little late, so we start running.  Eventually we come to some kind of deep pit on campus-possibly even inside a building..  My textbooks fall over the side and land on a ledge several feet below.  When I try to climb down to get them, I can't reach them, and I end up hanging on to the edge, unable to go down or to pull myself up.  I am already probably 15 minutes late for class, and still don't know what I am going to teach.  Somehow I get rescued-from the pit, not from the class-and find the classroom, a small, narrow, claustrophobic room with no windows.  Robinette Schwarzeneggle is there."

There is a golf course there, and I want to get up and play golf.  The two relatives get up before me and go to sign up to play.  I call to them to wait for me, but they have already left.  I am very disappointed, because I would much rather play with them than with strangers.  We start looking for a place to eat.

I do, however, feel great uncertainty.  I feel like the age I am now, but she seems to be the age she was then.  We are in bed together in her house.  We are getting ready to make love, she on top of me, and I don't feel very enthusiastic about the prospect.  She gets off, and is lying with her head at the foot of the bed when her mother comes in.  She seems a little upset--not at the fact that we are in bed together but at the way we are arranged.  At another point in the dream, I am coming by to pick Bonita up, and it turns out that on this particular night, her parents run a restaurant in their house.  The house is big, with more than one story, and the restaurant is very active.  I feel funny about just walking in, and in fact I am challenged by the maitre-d, but when I tell him why I am there, he lets me go in."

I am very high up, maybe 10-12 stories, and I am very nervous trying to hold on to the kitten as I descend.

One horse glows purple in the setting sun, and the other orange; both have a kind of slick, shiny appearance.  I think it would be a great picture, but as I approach the fence, getting my camera ready, they turn slowly and walk off farther away.  By the time I am ready to take the picture, they are out of range, and clouds are passing over the sun.  There is a group of people in the field, and one of them, a young woman, holds a calf up.  I want to get a picture of that, too, but can't get there in time.  Then there are two guys standing on really tall stilts right beside a building with something like an open hay loft in it.  They are so tall that they are on the same level as the loft; the loft has people standing or sitting in it too.  Some people are taking pictures of that, but the sun is in my face, and when I go to get another angle, I have difficulty focusing my camera, and eventually I find that the men aren't there anymore.  It is a frustrating dream.  "

The only thing I know to do is to assign each person to read a different chapter or different story in the book, and have them talk about it.  But I feel that that is obviously a waste of class time to do something that they could have done at home in preparation for the class if they had been told to do so, and I am afraid someone will complain.  Carl Scheibe is in the class, which surprised me, because there are different levels, like in language classes, and I think he should be in a higher level.  There is some scheduling conflict, though, that necessitates his being in this class.  I am really embarrassed about being unprepared in front of him."

There was only a small counter where you could buy a few things that didn't need preparation.  I asked if they had cereal, and he said they did.  He named a few kinds that I had never heard of.  While I was making up my mind, I got a small carton of milk, and for some reason he also gave me a block of chocolate ice cream in a plastic bag tied with a twist-em.  Medea was there, too; when we went out to sit in the cafeteria, I realized that I had forgotten my cereal.  When I went back, there was no one there.  After waiting a while, it began to be one of those dreams where there is a long delay, and when I eventually went out to the seating area again, Medea was gone.  "

I met someone else who was living there, too-don't remember who, probably a Korean student who was in the same dream and who introduced me to another Korean student in the cafeteria.

I understood that the game was the next morning at 9 a.m., but I didn't know where it was to be played.  Someone gave me a number to call at a military academy, and I called and found out the field we were to play on.  After I hung up, though, I realized that I hadn't asked for directions.  One of the guys said just to ask at some office-I forget which one-but of course I didn't know where that office was either.  But then the game was to take place right away, and the guys were heading from one field to another.  When I had crossed one field, I remembered that I had left my glove and other stuff at the field we were leaving, so had to go back and get it.  Then I also found that I had no sneakers, only a pair of loose-fitting loafers.  I decided I would have to play barefoot.  I ran a few sprints to find how it would be, and I found I could run really fast, and turn on some extra speed for short bursts.  Then there was a little girl that I had to take care of.  She had on a sweater that was all tangled and twisted.  I decided I would have to take it off and put my sweatshirt on her.  I needed someone to help me get it off of her.

But in my heart I knew that I wouldn't come back, that I just didn't belong there and I wasn't even attending the classes I was in this semester.  After I talked to her I went to a class that I was unprepared for.  The teacher was a young woman with a long, narrow nose and a saffron robe like a monk.  Later on, I was in a room when a large group of women who looked similar and wore similar robes-Buddhist nuns.  I said that one of them had been my teacher, but all denied it.  They were going to perform some kind of experiment on me, and one of them put a cloth (but more like a soft Brillo pad) soaked in ether over my nose.  I knew that it was pointless to try to struggle, but I held my breath a long time, to make them think it wasn't doing any good and perhaps give up.  But they were persistent.

I was trying to find my way back to the hotel.  The city was an amazing place: there were huge buildings, unusual designs, new buildings under construction, and walkways that connected many of the buildings inside, and lots of stairs and escalators and narrow twists and turns.  I came to one open excavation which seemed to be as deep as a skyscraper was tall, and I recoiled in fright from the edge of it.  I came to another room which was a huge empty carpeted room with all glass on one side.  A couple of people were talking in the middle of it, and one of them offered to assist me.  I was totally lost.  One staircase was labeled ""Men"" and ""Women.""  I went down expecting to find restrooms, but instead found myself in a pornography shop, but instead of peepshows and magazines, there were long, narrow, open booths with women and men sitting on benches along both sides, the women in various stages of undress, but none completely naked.  I was very uneasy and got out immediately.  Soon after I left a man who was following me began talking to me; that made me uneasy too, but he seemed genuinely friendly."

You could hardly tell it was a lake because the water was so clear and did not refract light, so you could see the green fields of a meadow beneath it just as if you had been looking down on it from an airplane.  The name was Long Lake.  There was a steep, narrow gravel pathway going all the way down the hillside to the lake.  I thought it would be fun to go down it on a bike, but I didn't know how safe or easy it would be, because of the gravel, and I didn't know how difficult it would be coming back up, or if there was another way.

Anita stayed there with our bags while I went across the street to check our room-and the hotel in general-because it looked pretty dumpy-a single white wooden door to the hotel, with no marquee or anything.  When I opened the door I found there was no lobby and no guests to be seen; I walked down a narrow corridor with frayed carpet leading to another white door, of the old-fashioned style like in the Lingerman's house.  Tentatively I opened it, and there was the registration desk-just a small room, with a single desk, and one woman working there.  I told her we had a reservation, and she didn't find it.  She said they had no rooms.  I was upset, because we had a printed confirmation in our luggage across the street; I told her I could produce it, and that I would never stay at a Marriott again if she turned us away.  She seemed to want to be helpful, and asked me to wait while she searched again.  I wasn't even sure I wanted to stay in such a place, but it was so convenient that I waited, and sure enough she did come up with a room-probably one they were holding in reserve."

The saw had a very short blade, and it was clearly going to take some time, especially since I had to cut through from one side to the other in about three different directions.  It cut surprising easily, though.  At one point I saw some clothing in the hollow beneath the pavement that I cut open.  I recognized them as belonging to my wife Anita and me.

As the guy was getting out of his parking place, I tried to memorize his license plate, but not to look too conspicuous doing it.  It was a long number-a combination of 8-10 numbers and letters, not sure what state.  I felt I couldn't remember the whole thing, so I tried to remember the first four and the last two or three.  John Forster was there, and he was also trying to see and remember the number.  He wasn't as inconspicuous, though, and the guy got mad at him for doing it.

Later on, or in a different dream, the preparations were a little more elaborate.  It seemed to be an event at a nearby university, because Maro Smith was there.  He was speaking to the group and mentioned a play or a movie which was going to take place either that evening or on Friday, I'm not sure, and he asked me if I was going to come.

I realized that I had failed to ask for them, or to give them an assignment.  In the midst of their leaving and another class entering the classroom, I shouted that they should turn in their bluebooks, and I frantically looked for the syllabus to see what the assignment was.  I remembered that there was an article to read about Education in the Soviet Union, and something about reading ""the campus poster.""  I thought the former was outdated, and the incoming teacher said they were to read the latter, so I shouted that they should also read ""the campus poster,"" although I had no idea what that was and realized that I would have to find out myself before the next class.  In the midst of all this confusion, my students were laying their bluebooks on a low wall at the front of the classroom, and some of them were sliding off.  I felt very unprofessional and was filled with anxiety. Later, I was in a faculty office.  Mary Kodd was there preparing something.

At some point, either on the way or after not finding our destination and heading back, either my daughter Christina or my son Burt, who was with me, spotted the Ferris wheel of an amusement park on a street at a higher level than we were on, and back the way we had come, and he/she wanted to stop.  So I told the taxi driver to turn around, but he had to go a ways before he could do so, and then we didn't find any amusement park.  I was anxious that the fare was going to cost even more.  When we finally stopped, I was relieved that the fare was less than $5.00.  The driver was Indian.  For some reason, he gave me $5.00 and showed me his ID, and I was trying to figure out how to allow for the fact that he gave me $5 in trying to get the right amount out of my wallet to pay him and tip him generously.  I finally decided just to give him back his $5.00 and give him $6 or $7 more-but my wallet was stuffed with big bills, and I couldn't find a $5.  I decided to take everything out so that I could go through them more easily. In the process, a lot of checks fell out, and some of them had been shredded.  So there was paper everywhere, and my checks were scattered, and it was a big mess.   Sue Bailey and Frances Reed were there, and one of them commented to the other in my hearing that it was amazing that I was really very professional in other contexts.

After stirring it up, I found that there was a layer of water on top of it, and I had to find a measuring cup to dip it off and not throw away pudding in the process.  That was kind of tedious.  It was time for the meeting to start, and I was still skimming water off, and then I had to find a bowl to put it in, because I didn't want to leave it in the sink.  I was desperately looking in cabinets for a bowl large enough to hold it.  While I was looking, Tran and Alai were also searching for bowls, and Tran told me that the meeting was starting.  Again I was filled with frustration and anxiety.  Carl Scheibe came to the front door-it was a temporary building something like the building my department is in at my former place of work.  His hair was in a big black Afro, and he was asking if anyone had seen Mo Cloward.  It was the second time he had been by asking for someone.

At first I said no thanks, that it wasn't that much farther, but then I realized I had no shoes and the rocks and sticks were hurting my feet, so I accept her offer.  However, since she drove a car with the driver's seat on the right, which was right at the edge of the embankment, I couldn't quite figure out how I could get in, unless I climbed over her, or she moved over and let me drive.  Whichever it was, I did get in, and rode with her.  She stopped at some kind of country store, rather than the Lingerman's, and she and her family lived above the store.  I was really attracted to her, and when she went to her room to get dressed to go out, I decided to change my clothes and go with her if I could.  I changed from jeans to a pair of tan slacks, and from dirty sneakers to a pair of brown dress shoes.  But it took so long to find them, or to put them on, that by the time I got them on I was afraid she would already have left, so I went to her room, pulled out my cell phone, and used a function that sounded like a doorbell.  She was there, and had not finished dressing.  Her door was like a dressing room door, and she pushed a deck of cards under it and told me to pick one.  I took the top card; it was a six, and she said that was too high.  I took another one, and it was a zero.  She said that was too low.  The third one I drew was a three, and that gained me admittance to her room, but she had already gone.   While I was looking for her, Lila came in the room and said that she had some problem that the girl's mother, apparently, was going to take her to a doctor for, ""Dios le bendija.""  I felt like I should offer to take her, but I wanted to find that girl first.

On the way, though, we encountered a group of guys who reminded me of guys I had known in high school, though I don't remember anyone in particular.  They stepped into my path and then surrounded me.  One of them hit me in the back.  I thought if I was tough enough they would let me go.  For some reason I even tempted them to hit me.

I protested, and she stopped right away.  I was afraid she wouldn't be able to back up on such a steep slope, but she was.  When we got to her apartment, it was about 10 p.m.  I went with her to the door, but didn't assume I would be invited in, because she didn't say anything about it.

When it was time for me to leave (France), I arrived at a train station with my ticket.  It was almost time for my train to depart, so I had to hurry.  By some stroke of luck, I took a door which led me directly to the trains without having to go through baggage check or security or anything, thus saving some time.  But the first trains I found were not mine.  I told an employee ""Ce n'est pas mon train"" and showed him the ticket, and he told me to go downstairs to a different level.  When I got there, I saw my train-like a Metro train with the doors open.  Just as I saw it, it started to move slowly forward, the doors still open.  It wasn't far, and I thought I could run across the platform and hop in before the doors closed, but my sleeve caught briefly on a railing, and before I could disentangle it, the train was moving faster, and I knew I couldn't possibly make it.

"3-073"	"(2004-04-01)"	"#3-073 (2004-04-01) I was lying in bed in a school when I remembered that I had invited Carl Scheibe to come and speak to my class.  I quickly got up and went to my classroom, where I found him already speaking to the class.  Most of the class seemed to be Chinese.  I was embarrassed about being late, but glad to see he had taken over without me.  I lay down in another bed which was in the classroom, my eyes heavy with sleep.  After a few minutes I realized that it was horribly inappropriate for me to be in bed half asleep while he conducted the class.  I started to get up, and realized that I was wearing only boxer shorts and a short t-shirt.  I didn't know whether it was worse to stay in bed, to get up in front of the class dressed that way, or to leave again to go get something else to put on, thus calling attention to the way I was dressed..  I was just anxious for the class to end.  When he was finished with his presentation, I hoped that the class would ask him questions to fill up the rest of the time.  It was 10:10, and the class ended at 10:20.  There were a couple of questions, but they didn't fill up the time, and I worried about what to do, since I had nothing prepared, and I didn't know what he had been talking about.  I wondered if it was all right to let them go 5 minutes early.  I didn't think so, since it was a public school about high school or junior high level, not college.  When he ended, though, he was talking about a ramshackle house which was in the classroom-something about its history.  Desperately trying to find something to fill the time, I looked in and saw a cloth clothespin bag on the end of a pole.  I took it out and asked the students if they knew what it was for."

I thought I was the on-deck batter, but then I noticed that my team was in the field, and there was no place for me.  At first I thought my team was playing the Detroit Tigers, because the batter had a Tigers uniform on, and I thought that it was strange that they would play an exhibition game against a ragtag team like ours-but then I saw that the other players on his team had regular clothes.  As I watched, the batter was hit by a pitch.  He glared at our pitcher, and then he took a few steps toward the mound, the bat held above his head in both hands.  Our pitcher took a couple of steps toward him, but then players from both sides held them back, and some shouted ""Bush."" at the batter to chastise him for his actions.  I thought he was trying to emulate big leaguers."

A black girl riding next to the driver said that she didn't care about others, she was going to listen to her favorite music-from the 50's and 60's.  I slapped her back with enthusiastic approval, and said ""WMZQ?""  I think I meant WYXR(?)  When we got to the city where I worked, we parked and they started getting out of the van and filing into some shop or department store.  I was greatly disappointed and asked about the game.

I tried to tell them about the macular degeneration, but couldn't think of the word ""macular,"" so I said ""retinal.""  Irene's mother said she had had the same thing, and she really missed seeing things.  One of her eyes looked in a different direction from the other one. When I finally got up and began to circulate at the party, I saw to my shock that not only was Robinette Schwarzenegger there, so was Judy Cookson.  I thought maybe Robinette was still living with Jerry and came on his invitation, but I thought it really took some nerve for Judy to come without an invitation.  I was surprised that Robin was there because sometime earlier in my dream, Jerry had come into an office where I was working-presumably at our department-and began to use the file cabinet.  Over his shoulder he thanked me for my invitation and said that ""Irina"" was going to come too.  I guessed that he had remarried.  Anyway, I got in bed with my wife Anita in another room and wondered how she would react to their being there.  I was afraid she would cause a scene by ordering them to leave, but I feared even more that she would make me order them to leave.  To my surprise, though, she seemed to be amused by the situation.  Our bed cover looked like the top of a stove, with burner covers. I went outside, and found that quite a few people were outside, and that we were already in the state we were retiring to.  They had gone for a walk, looking around our property, and they had opened a section of fence between our property and a neighbor's who had livestock.  I was concerned about that, but didn't see any of the horses or cows around.  We lived on a mountain top, and the moon was shining on the snowy peaks of more mountains across the intervening valley.  It was beautiful.  I pointed it out to the guests, and they oohed and aahed. As people began to leave, I noticed that some horses and cows had indeed come down from the neighbor's property through the fence.  I was really afraid that the neighbor was going to be really mad at me for letting them out, and I began trying to herd them back through the gap by running and shouting at them.  It worked fairly well, but I was anxious, because I needed to be telling my guests goodbye at the same time.  There was even one panda which had escaped.  When I ran at it, it began doing back flips toward the fence opening.  I was still trying to herd these animals, when I came back into consciousness.  I was aware that I was breathing heavily and thought Anita would worry and try to wake me up, but at the same time I was still in the dream enough to worry about getting the animals back through the fence. I guess it was when I went back to sleep that I was telling the guests goodbye.  There were two young women leaving together that I didn't know very well; one of them I didn't know at all.  When they began to drive away, I remembered something that someone had told me about the route back-something about its being closed at some point, and an alternate route one would have to take.  I ran and stopped them, but I couldn't remember the details of what I had been told.  I spent a long time in frustration trying to think of it.  Finally I had to content myself only with having warned them that they might encounter a problem.  Later on, I was in a museum and encountered these same two young women.  The one I knew slightly was conducting a tour of the museum for some well-heeled visitors who were considering making a substantial donation.  The other woman, whom I had met only at the party, was apparently her assistant, not involved in the tour.  I was going to ask her if they had had any trouble coming back, and also for advice about seeing the museum, but I guess I woke up, because I don't remember any more."

He just smiled cryptically.  By the time we got to the bottom floor another guy had gotten on the elevator-a tall guy named Kyle, whom I apparently knew, at least by reputation.  When the elevator doors opened, the elevator was 8-10 inches above the level of the floor, and I warned everyone to watch their step when getting out.  Also, just in front of the doors was a square shallow pit in which a number of dead bodies lay.  We had to be careful to step around that too.  Kyle, however, whom I knew to be an obnoxious and disgusting lout, walked right across them, even stepping on their faces.  When he got out, I wanted to slug him in the face and knock him back into the pit to lie among the bodies, but his back was turned to me and he was too tall for me to reach around and hit him in the face, so I punched the back of his knees with my knees so that they would buckle, and I pushed him into the pit.  Well, there was a narrow but deep trench around the platform where the bodies lay, and Kyle fell into that trench.

Sometimes it walks, sometimes I carry it.  Sometimes I walk, and sometimes I fly.  We go over fields, and I have to fly because there are fences.

Unfortunately the box is not in the front, and so I do have to walk through the mess hall.  Most of the men are also in uniform, and I do hear a few sarcastic mutters of ""Ooh, a captain.""   I don't find the box in the back either, and when I come back, I have to squeeze between one wall and the tables of men eating next to it.  From across the room I hear ""Yo ho Carlos.""  I have the feeling it is directed to me, but I don't stop, because I'm not sure.  Then I hear it again, and I stop.  One of the guys not in uniform is talking to me, although he is looking in a different direction.  He makes some remark about my rubbing up against that dirty wall.  I look down at a piece of chalk I am carrying in my hand and lightly trailing against the wall.  It has a little dirtiness on the tip, but not much, and my uniform doesn't appear to be dirty.  I respond, icily, ""Does my touching this wall have some significance for you?""  I considered saying ""Do you have a problem with it?"" but I was afraid that would sound like a challenge to fight.  He doesn't respond, and I walk out of the mess hall."

I crawl into it and think how difficult it will be to paint it when I move.  I decide that I will have to have someone else do it.  The surface is rough and irregular like stucco, and it gives me claustrophobia just to be in it, not to mention painting it.

They don't seem to have a system, and sometimes are walking on the fresh stain before it can be buffed.  I also notice that the floor slopes at one point like a swimming pool, and I wonder how it is possible to play basketball on that and whether they are going to fix it.  One of the people sitting on the floor staining it is Sonny Binkle.  When I walk past him, he playfully reaches out with his brush and puts a stripe down the pants which I am wearing, which are light tan slacks about the color of the floor.  It makes me mad that he has probably ruined a good pair of pants, but I try to make a joke about it by commenting on the similarity of the color of my pants to the color of the floor.  But I think about how I can get even.  Carole Warner is also there.  She remarks sarcastically to someone that they are fixing up the opera house with all these people and even me, Phil.  I interpret her remark to mean that I don't like opera.  The woman to whom the remark is directed says, ""Oh, everyone loves opera.""  I think to myself, ""Oh sure, sister.""

It's a good thing, too, because I don't seem to be able to increase my altitude.  At some point I am concerned that I am getting too far ahead of a group of people who are flying behind me, and I try to make a wide u-turn and go back.  I have to make a very wide turn, but there are power lines off to my left, and I don't want to chance running into them.

She said matter-of-factly that he was in the car.  I was shocked and alarmed that she had left him there and ran back to the car, where I found him crying.  She soon came back and got in the back seat with him to calm him down.  I also got in the back seat.  It was really crowded.  I couldn't sit facing forward.  I felt very affectionate toward her, and didn't know whether she would reciprocate it.  I think she did, because I was worried that someone from her family would pass by, recognize her car, and see us in an embrace."

I show him the boxes in the storage room, and fortunately he choose one which I would not have used anyway-a large wooden box with a hinged top.  He is going to use it for shipping some kind of old-fashioned computing machine, which I remember having seen in his department.   A little later, two women come by to pick up something which I made for them-some kind of model castle, I believe.  I have also made some kind of costume for them.  One is an Asian woman-perhaps an older student-and she puts a colorful basket on her head; it looks pretty good on her, and she likes it.  The other woman is Arab.  She already has a head scarf, but whatever the other costume is, she is happy with it too.  I have already been working past the hours I was hired for, and it is about 4:30 in the afternoon, but I notice that the supply room in the department where I am working is a mess, and I think it will make people surprised and happy if I clean it up.  The floor is covered with leaves and trash, and I begin looking for a broom.

The floor of the bathroom is rough and uneven concrete, the walls of the pit are painted, with the paint flaking off, and at the bottom of the pit is a lot of junk, including old clothing.  I am shocked at the conditions, particularly since we are thinking of buying the house.  At the top of at least one wall is a window, or at least an opening to the outside-it has no window on it.  It is covered inside by wire mesh which extends the length of the wall.  This wire mesh is not attached well to the wall, and the window is at ground level (the room itself being mostly below ground level), so that anyone could easily enter from the outside.  I know my wife Anita could not tolerate this condition, and it even worries me, but I don't know what I can do immediately to fix it.  It seems like the owner has added this room on to the house and never finished it.  I wonder how much it would cost us to get it fixed.

Apparently someone else is living there, because when I go up, there is a children's room at the top of the stairs, and children's things are all about.  There are a lot more rooms, and some of them have large windows in them; there are people seated on furniture on the other side of them.  At first I think there is another house adjoining ours, and the windows are between them, but then I realize that they are simply between rooms in the same house.  There is also a third level, beneath the main level.  There is a bathroom which has a bathtub which is narrow and deep enough for one person to stand up waist deep in water; there is also a hot tub in that room.  Down the hall there is a swimming pool.  At first it appears that the ceiling is too low for people to raise their heads above the water, but then someone turns on the lights and I see that the illusion was created by a single low pipe at head level near the door to the pool.  The house is fabulous, and even though it is much larger than my wife Anita and I need, I tell her that at $290K it is a bargain, and we should stretch our budget to buy it.  Now she is the reluctant one; she doesn't want all the additional space.  I want to discuss it with her, but she is talking to a friend in the living room, and there is a black choir practicing outside and we have two open windows with no glass in them, so it is too noisy to talk.  I put two cushions in one of the windows, but they don't completely fill it, and I have nothing with which to fill the other one. I leave the house and walk to a nearby hotel/shopping complex, much like the Mall in our former city.  As I am starting up the escalator, I hear someone talking about my alma mater.

I thought it was very rude, because the professor was still asking students to recite, and I thought the class was not over until 11:30.  Of course it did relieve me of the anxiety of being called on, but still I made a nasty remark to one of the girls who sat down near me, about how badly students behaved nowadays.  After I left, though, I realized that the class was supposed to end at 11:20 and the new one start at 11:30.  So it was the professor who was going over.  Still, it wasn't very polite for the new class to come in.  I was then potentially a little late for my next class.  I started to go there, but couldn't find my way.  There was a new dorm complex, with overhead enclosed walkways from one dorm to another, and there was a large outdoor food court.  I had a couple of acquaintances in that class and wanted to have coffee or lunch with them after class.  Soon, however, I realized that the door would be shut when I got there and the class under way.  I wasn't prepared for the class anyway, and decided not to go, and maybe to go meet my friends when the class was over.  I realized that I was not preparing for any of my classes, and now I was beginning to cut them, and wondered if I should just go home.  I was ashamed to tell Anita I had taken this whole semester off and spent the money just for the nostalgia of being back at the university."
"3-176"	"(2004-10-22)"	"#3-176 (2004-10-22) I wanted to limber up my arm and practice throwing for distance.  Two female friends went with me to a park to catch my throws, but we realized that we didn't have anything to throw.  We discussed what would work in lieu of a baseball or softball.  One of them suggested a grapefruit, and I said that it would be too soft and too large.  But it reminded me of how perfect lemons and limes had felt to me in the past for throwing, and I was willing to entertain the possibility of that.  In the end, though, I left the women in the park to go and get a couple of baseballs, either from my house or from a store.  It ended up being a wild goose chase; I had to take a bus, and then wasn't sure where to get off.  I was downtown, and it was pretty far between stops, so I would have to walk a lot if I got off at the wrong stop.  I was sweaty, and the bus was crowded; I felt uncomfortable for the people close to me.  There was a little girl standing next to me; she was friendly and talked to me a lot.  When I finally got off the bus, I had walked into something like a video arcade at the bus stop when I realized I hadn't paid my fare.  This was a Japanese-style system where you pay when you leave.  I rushed back and found the bus hadn't left yet.  When the last passenger had gotten off, I got on and dug a whole lot of change out of my pocket and started giving some of it to the bus driver.  I had the impression that the fare was 60 cents, but I couldn't distinguish one coin from another very well (even though it was American money), and I couldn't seem to keep up with the addition in my head.  As I gave it to him, the bus driver would tell me how much more I needed.  Finally, another bus driver dumped more change into my hand than I could hold; I couldn't figure out why.  I left the bus with a lot more change than I started with."
"3-177"	"(2004-10-23)"	"#3-177 (2004-10-23) I was sitting at a table in a food court with Malika.  One of her children was with her.  She said, ""You know we never did anything together after our class was over.""  I was taken by surprise and kind of stammered, ""Well...we could have lunch together...or see a movie.""  So apparently that was the plan for that day.  Then I ran into a Korean-American woman I know on the street outside.  I wanted to invite her too, but didn't know how Malika would feel about that.  We actually ended up going to a ""tai qi"" movie with several other classmates.  Several of them wanted to go to a vendor next to the theater to get something to eat, but it was time for the movie to start, and there was still a long line, so I went and got in line.  Nevertheless, when I got in the theater, somehow, the students were all there, though it was so dark I couldn't see them clearly, and I hoped that someone would see me and wave.  I found my Korean-American friend, but a friend of hers was sitting next to her.  I didn't see Malika.  Later, someone said that the friend had just left her seat temporarily to come and talk to her for a minute.  I felt badly for not keeping my promise to Malika."
"3-178"	"(2004-10-30)"	"#3-178 (2004-10-30) I was preparing to teach a class.   It was only a writing class, but it was at a section of a prestigious Development Bank, so I was more concerned about the preparations because I knew I would have sophisticated adults in the class with high expectations.  Trouble is, I had not even prepared the syllabus, and I didn't know what textbook I was going to use or what I was going to do to fill the time during the first class.  Moreover, I couldn't find appropriate clothes to wear.  None of the shirts were white, and none of them went well with any of the slacks on hand.  When I finally got an outfit together that I thought would work, and put it on, I found the legs of the pants came down only just slightly below the knees, they fit too tightly, and one leg was a different shade from the other.  The same problem arose with socks.  When I finally found a pair that I thought would be satisfactory (and this whole outfit had a kind of yellowish-green base), and I put them on, I found that they had such big holes in them that my feet would be uncomfortable in shoes.  It was 2:00 when I started trying to get everything together, and now it was 2:15, and the class started at 2:30-downtown.  I was in a faculty office where I used to work.  Several teachers were there, but the only one I remember is Patty Phillips.  To make things even more stressful, her sister (named Tess) was in the next room, and Patty wanted me to meet her. Before I left for the class, I tried to find Mary Kodd, who was now the director again, to confirm the schedule and find out the room.  I didn't find her, but I found some guy I knew from the Foreign Student Advisor's office on campus.  He was short, not very old, but with gray hair.  I didn't think he would know what I needed to know, but I asked him anyway.  Turned out he was now an assistant director,, and he had actually taught the course for several years.  He said the class started at 3:30, not 2:30.  That was a relief, but it only gave me time to get down there on time, not to prepare the class.  I got there somehow, still extremely anxious about what I was going to do in the first class.  Everything I could think of, I thought they would already know.  I decided to start with correction symbols, even though I was embarrassed about it for a first day topic, and I knew I had a handout with everything on it, but hadn't brought it with me.  I started with sp for spelling error.  Looking at their faces, I knew they expected more."
"3-179"	"(2004-10-30)"	"#3-179 (2004-10-30) I was in a large house with some relatives.  I was trying to find the bathroom, so that I could use it before going across the street to get in a military formation which was already gathering.  When I found a bathroom, it was tiny, like a port-a-john, and while I was in it, one of the relatives, a pre-teen or teenager opened the door.  I was embarrassed and told him to come back later when I was finished.  I felt a lot of pressure about getting to the formation on time; I felt sure I would be late and get in trouble.  When I finished in the bathroom, I rushed across the street, where a large battalion-size gathering was already in place but still spacing themselves out.  I didn't know where I was supposed to go.  I ran in among them, where it looked like there might be a gap, and one guy told me where to stand.  I asked him if he was the platoon leader, and he smiled and said no.  I was relieved to know that I had made it in time and had not been noticed by the commanders.  Before everyone was in place, we were dismissed for the day and told we could pick up coupons for free beer."
"3-180"	"(2004-10-31)"	"#3-180 (2004-10-31) I was waiting to watch, or take part in, some carnival games.  The first one involved gymnastics.  Someone I was with, or at least knew, took part, but I didn't.  She did a back flip; I thought it must be nice to be able to do that, and for a moment I did it in my mind, sort of testing to see if I thought I could do it, but I decided it wasn't worth the risk.  Then there was some kind of game involving a big pile of tiny yellow glass beads.  There were four such piles on a flat area, each attended by a different person.  They gave you a flat implement sort of like a can opener, with a flat hook at one end, but I couldn't figure out what you were supposed to do with it.  I asked a few people, but couldn't get an answer that I could understand or remember.  This went on a long time.  Finally, it was so late that the game closed, and I went on to play softball.  There was a game going on, and I was catching.  There was only one batter; they were playing workup, I guess.  The batter hit the ball to deep left center.  The fielders didn't do much to try to catch it or to retrieve it.  Everyone was just standing around.  I was frustrated, and ran all the way to the outfield fence from the catcher's position and retrieved the ball-so that I could bat.  I told the pitcher to come in and catch and someone else was supposed to pitch.  I picked up the bat, for the first time in a game in a long time, and it felt really good.  I just wondered whether to bat right-handed or left-handed.  The right field fence was sort of like the ""green monster"" in Fenway Park-very close but very high.  Left field was much deeper.  I wanted to bat left handed, but knew I had a tendency to hit grounders from that side.  It would be very satisfying to hit a home run to left field, but I was afraid if I swung too hard I would pop up.  Unfortunately I never got the chance to make the choice, because that is when I woke up."
