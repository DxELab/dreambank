"001"	"(06/19/62)"	"We were in a used car lot looking for a car, and most of the cars that we saw were little white Fiats like the one that we have. The car lot was up in the mountains and there were all sorts of winding roads around it. The car dealer was showing my husband one car that was made out of some sort of wood and it was covered with this whitely paint and it was a very funny car. It really didn't look much like a car, but it was so rotten that it was starting to fall apart right in the middle of the demonstration. I knew that he was trying to sell us this car that it really wasn't any good."
"002"	"(06/19/62)"	"This dream started out sort of confused. I was with this group of people and we were walking somewhere. It was not exactly a procession, but it was somewhat. I gathered some grass and some twigs. We were going to the big church. It seems that these people I was with were Catholics, and we were going to some sort of religious ceremony. We were going to this particular church because there were some Zulus there. And somehow it was important that they had something or other that we were supposed to get to use in our ceremony, and just as we got up to the church, this group of people found out they weren't Negroes, but they were dressed in these skinny orange costumes. We went into the church and there weren't any pews or anything. One person who is the leader had the little incense burner. She was sitting front of the rest of us who were lined up against the wall. I thought this was sort of a funny group of religious people and none of them were particularly religious, and I didn't understand what the ceremony was about. And about this time somebody came in. It was the husband of one of the people in the group, and they said they had some work to do. And then I saw that there was a microscope and a typewriter set up on a table over in a corner of the church. And so everybody said, well, they would go out then if this person had to do the work. Then I was doing the work. I used to work for the University School Library and it seemed I was doing some work for them again. I was typing up cards for the catalogs. There was one card that I was supposed to type up and I kept making mistakes. I couldn't ever type what you have to type. These things have to be just exactly so, and I couldn't copy it right. And I tried over and over again, and every time I did, something was wrong. And so after working on this for quite a while, I woke up."
"003"	"(06/19/62)"	"I was trying to be able to nurse my daughter again. I did nurse her until she was about 7 months. She's about 14 months now. I was trying several strange devices. I can't remember any of them except one was turning the heat way up to high to be able to do this, but seeing this was going to be useless."
"004"	"(06/19/62)"	"My husband and I seem to be driving down some little mountain roads. There was an episode concerning the an Inn in a mountain resort town, which is a sort of fancy hotel that I saw not very long ago on our vacation, and also concerning a huge pink hotel which is close to it. Some girl was telling me that this other hotel was really a lot better and that was why they didn't need to advertise so well as the Inn. The girl--who is about my age--and I went walking down toward this pink hotel, down a long series of not exactly stairs. It was a hill that had little bricks set in, but it really wasn't stairs. I can't describe what it was. Somehow this  Inn becomes a very small place, a sort of motel or small hotel further up in the mountains and my husband and I are there. There are quite a few dirt roads around it and also one paved road. It is supposed to be sort of a private scenic tour for the patrons of this place. We see quite a few other people who have come back from it, who are going on it, and so we decided we will too. We start down and once we seem to have made a mistake because it's extremely narrow. And it looks so small, you wonder how a car could get down it. And it's very sharply curved and a lot of the curves occur going down at about a 45-degree angle and then just sort of disappear at a right angle around the cliff. And also the road seems to have been cut out right under them. The cliffs, rather the rocks of the cliff, are hanging right over the road and yet we started on this road and there's no way to turn around. So we keep on going on it for a while and it's rather confused what happens after this. Somewhere we found a wild turkey, a live one, which was a very strange-looking bird, and we ran into my family, at least my little brother (10-year-old brother) and we showed him the wild turkey and he was sort of impressed by it."
"005"	"(06/19/62)"	"We got into my home in my hometown for some reason, and I found that there were several parties that were being given by various people with whom I graduated. It seems to be either a graduation party or a homecoming party or something on this order, and I was going to go to several of them. It seemed that somebody sent me some flowers. I don't remember what kind. I took them out of the box they were in, and I put several pieces of jewelry into this box to send to somebody, probably not the same person. I don't believe it was really my idea. A lot of the jewelry was very fancy and lovely--cut stones of deep, sparkling blue-green color. There were bracelets, earrings, pins, and I don't know exactly what. Then there were several pieces of plain jewelry --gold clips or something on this order--and it was sort of a test for the person to whom it was sent. They were supposed to pick out the plain jewelry. At about this time I started wondering what I was going to wear to these parties because I hadn't expected to go to any parties when we came down and I hadn't brought anything suitable with me."
"006"	"(06/20/62)"	"My husband and I were in this house, in one room of it. In another room of it, which we could see, through the door were two people, fifteen years older or so than ourselves, I guess. A man and a woman were lying on this bed, not exactly making love, but they were playing around with each other. We also were having sexual play, but we weren't so much excited as we were just in very high spirits. We apparently didn't care that these other people were in the next room and they apparently didn't care that we were in there. But then the man came out and said he had just gotten word that the son and his boss had gotten this contagious disease that was very dangerous. I got it somehow. I don't know exactly what are the symptoms, but I knew I had it. And I went into this next room with the man and woman in bed and there was a big cupboard in the kitchen and it had a variety of different types of food in it. And I got a bottle of vinegar and drank some of it and then someone said to me it didn't matter because they didn't know for this plague what they could eat to cure it. Apparently there had been an army of plagues. I was rather scared, I guess, but I wasn't terribly frightened that I had this."
"007"	"(06/20/62)"	"I was with some man roughly my age, a little older. He was telling me that he has to commute every day between these two places and that there's no road, so he has to walk. We're standing beside this narrow, recently completed road as we talk. It's in some foreign country, maybe Africa, North Africa. As we're standing there beside this narrow little road, which has very narrow shoulders, huge trucks and cars were driving by at a high speed. It's sort of unnerving because there's such a narrow shoulder and you can't get off the road very easily. But we started walking down the road toward the place where he had to go. And after we walked for a little while, we came to a place where the road goes under this big dam. For some reason we couldn't follow it. We have to go over the dam. Though we call it a dam, it doesn't have any of the qualities that you think of in a dam because there isn't a light pilot behind it. There is to one side of it and there isn't a stream of water coming over on this side of it. It is just a very high, steep cement barrier. So we started climbing up this. It was a pretty rough climb and you could look over the edge and see this big drop down below that was sort of scary. Somehow another girl had gotten into it. She was climbing up too. When we got up to the top, we saw that we couldn't go any farther for some reason. There was a big, high wall to scale and we couldn't go any farther. So we looked over the edge and down below, along the side. There were some children playing beside the edge of the lake. To attract their attention, one of us threw something down close to them which broke, sort of, as it had been glass. Then some people came up to us, and to get them to help us, we told them that we would give them something we had. What we had was supposed to be a radio communicator to communicate with the United Nations. It was illegal to have it, but we had it. So they agreed to help us and return from this thing. We went over to the edge of the wall and it was about 20 or 30 feet down to the water. One of the people who was helping us to jump down, we--I and another person--didn't very much like this idea. There was another way to climb down, so we did this. Then we had to jump into the water and swim over to their little boat for some reason and then swim back again. So we did this and then I was trying to fix a gadget that we had till we knew that it was something else, and knowing that they would probably never be able to use it."
"008"	"(06/21/62)"	"In this dream my husband I were walking down a little road in the mountains somewhere and we came to a large house and there was a man standing out on the road in front of the house. We started talking to him. He had two huge dogs, a Great Dane and a St. Bernard, that came out from the house. He told us not to be nervous about them and that they wouldn't hurt us. They were just playful. So they came galloping up and began to jump around and everything. I wasn't particularly afraid of them, but they were just huge dogs. The woman of the house came out and we started talking. Both of these people were in their middle or late thirties. She asked me if I liked riding. I said I did; I hadn't ridden in a long time, wasn't very good. Then she asked if I would like to, and I said, ""Of course I would."" Then these two dogs weren't dogs any more, but they were horses. That didn't particularly astonish me. One of them was a Parcharon, that was the one that had been the Great Dane, I think, and the other one was just a big horse. So we were leading the horses around to the back of the stables to get them saddles and everything. I began noticing as we were back there that there was something a little strange about her attitude. She wanted me to ride this bigger horse. Of course, it was a Parcharon, but it was still a good riding horse. I mean, it wasn't just a work horse. She wanted me to ride it, and I finally realized over the corner of the stable was a strange little anthropoid. It was mostly monkey. He was dark and he had sort of fur all over him, but he was also human. His strangest attribute was that he had four arms, and he was working at some sort of counting machine. He was putting up bunches of silverware and linen, putting them away into little bags and labeling them all neatly. I asked the woman what he was doing and she said, ""Oh, he's burying them."" I realized that this stuff was wedding gifts for her sister, who was supposed to have been married in a few days, but her sister had been killed. It seemed to me that she had been over to our place. This included my family--my brothers and my sister--when she had been killed. We hadn't murdered her and I realized there was going to be a trial. Mainly my older brother. He's about 20. She had been climbing some trees with him and she had fallen down and been killed apparently. I realized that this woman thought that they had murdered her intentionally, although I don't know why they would have done it because we didn't know the people. She was going to try to take her revenge by having me apparently killed in some sort of riding accident. So I left and I was in with my brother and maybe my sister and somebody else. We went down the road talking about it, and going over what we would say in court because we knew it had been an accident."
"009"	"(06/21/62)"	"We walked down to the bottom of this little gravel road which we had been on this time, and came to a sort of highway, somewhat like the Parkway. There was just my husband and me. He said, ""Let's cross the road and go over there and climb up that trail for a little ways."" So we did and started up this little trail, which at first was paved with cement. As we went up further, it was a very steep angle. It turned into some funny little hemispherical flat pieces of metal which were sort of ridged, tacked together in an angle going up. This was sort of a narrow thing on the outside of these little ridges. It was just a drop. There was nothing under them and then there was sort of a roof a couple of feet over them. So we were climbing up and I didn't like it very much. It wasn't very easy and I was sort of scared. My husband was having a great time. I wanted to go back. About this time some other people started climbing up right behind me so I couldn't. When we got up to the top, there was no place to go. There was just a blank wall, a shield wall. There was a ladder about three feet away from where we were and it went just straight up. My husband was happy there. He didn't even want to go back down. Finally I persuaded him and the people behind me to turn around and start back down, and then we did."
"010"	"(06/23/62)"	"I dreamed I was in a large  room, a waiting room of some sort. There were quite a few people in it. What we were waiting for was a turn in these sort of public baths that they had, which were not Greek or Roman style (large swimming pool-type things), but just a long bath tub. I didn't seem to think it strange that we were waiting, or that there was even anything unusual about it, except that this was in Paris somewhere. All around the people spoke French. I saw a boy that I knew. I went down and sat beside him. He's a blond boy who is a graduate student in English at my university. We started talking. He was tired of waiting and he wanted to go somewhere to find a half bath. He wanted to know if I didn't want to go with him, but I decided that I didn't. I'd rather share a huge bath full of strangers than one bath with somebody that I knew that well. He plays the guitar very well and he and several other people in the room now had guitars and were playing them. I showed him the guitar that we had recently gotten and I asked him if he thought it was a good one. He started playing it and then he started to tune it. He took all the strings out and I thought that surely wasn't necessary in order just to tune it."
"011"	"(06/23/62)"	"I just finished reading a play in which the two principle characters take poison at the end and die on their wedding night. This was the subject of the dream I had last night and can only remember part of, in which I was one of these two characters. Only in this case an old woman found us and gave us some sort of an antidote for it. I didn't think it would do much good because it was about 12 hours since we had taken the poison or something. But then both of us knew we were in a play. My husband and I--I don't know if this was my husband really or a character in the play--we knew that we were in a play, but we also knew it was real and we didn't know how it was going to come out. But I figured that since we were being allowed to talk about it, to talk about our future and whether or not we are going to die, we probably are going to stay alive and not be poisoned. If we were dead, somebody else would be reporting about it. we wouldn't still be talking about it."
"012"	"(06/23/62)"	"My husband and I were planning a vacation trip thru the mountains. We had maps and were figuring out different places that we wanted to go. The maps were hard to follow because they were too general and they didn't have all the details I found that we needed. But we figured out where we were going to stop the first night in some little town. While we were thinking about this and figuring it out, we were there somehow. It was just a little mountain town and we were looking or a restaurant to eat at. Also in this dream we figured out somehow that in our trip thru the mountains that we were going to see the Grand Canyon."
"013"	"(06/24/62)"	"I dreamed that my husband and I were in my husband's hometown, where his mother still lives, and that his mother and I had gone to the laundromat. On our way back, she turned the car around and started driving the wrong way up this one-way street. There were quite a few cars on this street and one car, when they saw us driving up the wrong way, pulled over to the side, only perpendicular to the street, and two other cars crashed into this car and, of course, it was our fault that this happened. But my husband's mother didn't seem to be very upset by it, but I was really indignant. I thought, ""When we get home, I'm going to tell my husband what his mother had done."" When we got home, he had been out shopping and he brought some strange clothes of very weird and very childish type of windbreaker, and suit and everything. He was acting very childish. I kept thinking about telling my husband about the car accident, but I never got around to it. While we were still there, I started helping somebody work on a jigsaw puzzle. It was a rather strange jigsaw puzzle. The two of us, whoever this other person was and I, were sort of having a race to see who could put the most pieces in right. Then the scene was that on the puzzle became real and it seems that we were up in the Arctic and there was a band of some sort of uncivilized people. There were Eskimos living there, and I was trying to persuade the wisest people of the tribe that I should be allowed to teach them some of the basic things, reading and writing, etc., because it seemed that they knew these things but their knowledge had been allowed to deteriorate over the years. They were listening to my arguments and they were going to let me do this. The emotion in this dream is generally neutral except I felt indignant toward my husband's mother and sort of felt it served her right because she was going the wrong way on a one-way street."
"014"	"(06/25/62)"	"I was in this old office building. I don't' know exactly how tall it was, maybe about 90 stories, and I was down in the coffee shop of this building. I had a job in this building. It was on the 84th story. This was pretty important. There was one elevator in the building and also a flight of stairs and the elevator was a very strange elevator because it had buttons in it just for a few of the stories, for the 3rd and 9th and the 25th and a couple of others. But everything about that was unmarked. There were no buttons to push to get there and you had to walk this strange contraption to get to the level that you wanted. I don't remember how I got up to this 84th story into this new job that I had, but I got up there somehow. I guess the job was some sort of secretarial work. I don't remember exactly what I was doing, but towards the end of the day when I wanted to go home, I noticed that there was nobody in the elevator to work it. I asked somebody about it and they said you were supposed to work it yourself. I didn't understand how to work it. I knew I would never work it right to get back down to the ground again. Also it took a fairly long time for this elevator. It was an old rickety thing to get up all the way to the top and back again, all the way down and back. So I walked around for a while and found this janitor and I asked him if he could run the elevator for me. We had quite a discussion about it, and he told me how to work it, and he told me he couldn't work it for me and he couldn't take the time unless there were 25 people going down. He took me to the elevator and showed me how it worked. There was a belt of some sort. If you pulled down on it, you would go down. If you pulled up on it, you would make the elevator go up. But, of course, you had to keep stopping and seeing if you were at the right place because there was no way of telling as there was no indicator inside the elevator. As the elevator shaft was open, you could see all the way down it. The elevator itself was only this wooden platform held up by some ropes. When I tried to step on it, it got smaller and smaller until it was just about 2 or 3 inches across. So I didn't much want to get on the thing. I went into the ladies' room and sat down on a couch and had a cigarette while I was thinking what to do. It was about 4:30. A bunch of people were there waiting for the elevator. I didn't think it was safe to go on it, so I decided that I would go down the stairs and started going down, and almost before I knew it, I was on the ground. It seemed like I had come down maybe about 10 flights and I had found it hard to believe that I was on the ground level. I went out through some doors in the building. It was real new. There was a green one and some parking lots. And across the way a little bit another wing of the building where the mechanics and people who worked in the building lived. It was strange that on this side of the building it seemed to be so new because it seemed  such an ancient building when I first went in it. But at any rate, I was outside the building. Somewhere I had met one of the mechanics who worked in this building. I was very attracted by him, and I had a crush on him. So I went over toward the wing of the building where they lived to see if I could find him. I went inside a big door like a truck entrance. I found myself in this low steamy tunnel that had pipes on the ceiling. The floor was damp and it was very moist and steaming in there. I saw two men, but I was too shy to ask them if they knew this boy. So I turned around and came back. I was going back to the building where it now turned out that I lived, and was going to my apartment where I lived with my aunt. Then this boy came up behind me and put his arm around me. I was very happy to see him. He came on into the apartment with me and he was going to have supper with me. My aunt was already serving the supper. She was an old woman. I don't have an aunt like this. She was about in her 70's, and I could tell she didn't much like the idea of this man being here. But she got a third plate and started serving us. She had pork chops and fried onions and rolls and apples or something like that for our supper, but there wasn't very much of it and I was sort of sorry that he had come for supper because there really wasn't enough for three. I was very happy to be with this young man, yet I thought to myself if my husband knew, he'd be very upset because of it. I decided he wouldn't really be very upset. It gets a little confused after this, but at some time or other I was back upstairs again and going up on the 84th floor going down to the ground floor again. And this time a lot of other people were going down the stairs with me because I persuaded them it was faster than the elevator. Everybody was hurrying down just as fast as they could, including this one man who was pushing this other man in a wheelchair. Everyone was rushing him and he was going as fast as he could, but, of course, he was going a little bit slower than everybody else, so everybody was passing him."
"015"	"(06/25/62)"	"There was a man, an evil sort of man, maybe almost a devil or something, who had this other group of men around him who did his bidding. These men were all eunuchs, but could still have intercourse. It seems in this dream that I was one of the men who was a follower of this man. It was in the summer, and it was in the mountains. There was a big camp not too far away for girls and boys. It was mostly a girls' camp. I had gone there several times before. There was a girl there whom I had caused by my magical powers to fall in love with me. But at any rate, the reason I was going to this camp now was because there was a boy there who was one of this man's followers, but hadn't been completely initiated into it or something, and I was supposed to tell him to come back with me. As I went toward the camp, it was a beautiful walk, there was a lot of little streams to cross and mossy banks to climb. Finally I got there. It's a little bit confused, but I went inside and into this big room which served as their library where the boy was working behind a desk, and he got frightened when he saw me. I couldn't really talk to him because there were other people in the room. He seemed to have gotten my message, and I went out, but in a while I came back again. This time there were even more people in the library, so I didn't get to talk to him. So I left again and I went out by this little side door and started across a brick walk under some trees. There were several girls who had just come back from the store, taking groceries out of this big station wagon and carrying them into the house. I didn't particularly want to be seen. So I tried to make myself inconspicuous as I walked past. Then as I went back toward the man, wherever this place was, I started thinking about this girl who went to another planet. There was some strange force. I had about 5 or 6 girls in love with me. It was a strange force, sort of double. I thought if I went away that one of these double parts of this force would follow me, but the other would stay. This part of the dream sort of faded and it was entertainment night at the university here. People had been putting on some plays. I thought of the play that I had recently thought up, and wondered if it might be able to be presented here. I was talking to the people. I was still this person or still anyhow a boy, and this girl beside me was in love with me, I guess. We were at the beach and there were several big ocean-going boats. We were going on this cruise with a whole lot of people. We got on one boat and we were sitting there not thinking about much of anything or talking about anything, and all of a sudden this huge storm came up out of nowhere and destroyed the boat. It was sort of like reading a novel. I thought about the ending and what would happen, and I thought of several ways of what might happen. It seems the one that finally happened was that I was a girl holding onto a life preserver, but I thought about how it would end, what would happen and I didn't know exactly what was going to happen."
"016"	"(06/26/62)"	"It was night, late twilight. It was in the mountains, and there was a high point from which you could stand and get a far view of the other mountains and trees and so on. I was up there with a couple of people who were strangers to me, a little older than I am. As you looked around from this vantage point, you looked down, you could see the earth, about 5 times larger than the moon usually looks, I guess, way down in a valley and not far off in the sky apparently, but very close. It was turning over and over, and it was mostly greenish and bluish, and it had a light flickering on it at various places shining off of it. It didn't seem strange to me that even though I was standing there, that I could see it down there, sort of floating in the air and turning around and moving along. My daughter got up there somehow  on top of this large sort of rock that I was standing on, and she is 14 months old, and she saw it and she wanted to get it. I had a hard time holding her back because if she would have crawled towards it, she would have fallen off the face of the rock. It wasn't exactly straight down, but she would have fallen."
"017"	"(06/26/62)"	"I was in my hometown and not very far from where we lived (not actually), was a hill on top of which was a pond. In this pond a heron lived. I thought it was a beautiful bird and I wanted to watch it, but my sister wanted to catch it and kill it and dissect it. I was very indignant and wanted to scare the bird away so it would never come back. It seems that everybody else in the family was in agreement with my sister. I couldn't understand why this should be so because it was such a pretty bird and there was no sense in killing it."
"018"	"(06/26/62)"	"I was in a large auditorium. There was a woman and a little boy or little girl on the stage. They were some sort of religious leaders, like revivalists or something. This woman also had a following of strange people and little children, an old woman, and an old farm laborer who came in later and joined them, who went around through the audience selling strange things. The woman apparently was preaching something about the virtues of sex, because on both sides of me these people sitting in the seats were having or were attempting to have intercourse, including these two men that were seated to my right. This dream was influenced by a set of characters in the Glass Harp by Truman Capote which I was reading last night."
"019"	"(06/27/62)"	"It was night and my husband and I were coming back from some sort of function, and we were going out in the parking lot toward our car. I looked up and saw the moon in the sky and some distance away from it I saw another moon. I thought that was awfully strange. There were two girls walking along behind me and I asked them if they saw it too. They said they did. I thought, ""That just can't be so. One of these isn't really the moon."" As I thought this, one of them started getting larger, and sort of reddish. And I thought, ""Aha, this is some sort of meteorite or something that's going to come crashing down onto us."" So my husband and I got home and turned on the radio to see what the news would say about it. But nobody was saying anything about it. There was this girl commentator who said that she had a special news bulletin that all of Georgia and Louisiana and some other place were on fire, but she didn't elaborate on it. We got the idea that whatever was happening, they were trying to play it down. It was daylight now, and the sun was in the sky. When I put on dark glasses and looked at the sun, I saw that this thing that I had seen yesterday was impinging on it and was touching it and was about the same apparent size as it was. I mean, now I could see that this thing was round, but you could see a crescent outline on it, like a crescent moon. So I went back in and told my husband that I knew what that must be. It must be Venus, but I wondered why it was so big. I thought there was something strange going on."
"020"	"(06/27/62)"	"I dreamed it was exam time and I was over in the hospital studying and some other people who were in my class came in. I started talking to them, and from their talk I figured out that I had been studying for the wrong thing entirely for the next day. It wasn't that all that I should have been studying for. I was real upset, but I wanted to see an exam schedule to make sure. I went into an office in the hospital that had something to do with the med school. I asked them if they had an exam schedule. I really didn't expect them to have one because the med school was on a different basis from the university. But I asked her anyhow and she said yes, she did. She was going to show me one and then she showed me all these ones that went up into the boys' individual rooms. While I was trying to figure it out, because it wasn't like an example schedule I'm used to, this doctor came in. He was a foreign doctor. I think he was German. He started asking me all these questions. He had been looking at my scholastic record and he thought it was mighty strange why I should be married and why I should have dropped out of med school after one year, which I didn't because I wasn't in med school. I was in biology though. He started asking me all sorts of questions. Why wasn't I working full-time instead of going to school? What I thought my husband was going to do. It was going to be a long time before we have any money and why didn't we have any savings, and a whole bunch of stupid stuff. I got real mad at him. I started telling him that my husband was going to have his Ph.D. in a year and that he was a very smart psychologist, and that what's more, he had a public health fellowship now and after he graduated, he was probably going to be out at the Menninger Foundation and he was going to have another public health grant tax free. It was going to be about $6500 per year. This doctor who irritated me so much was taken back by all this. He said, ""$6500 per year? Are you sure? I only make about $4500 myself."" But I don't remember what happened after this. It made me feel very good about telling off this person because he was irritating me."
"021"	"(06/28/62)"	"I dreamed that I and my husband had died, and we were being given our choice of where we wanted to go, to heaven or to hell. There were 2 little booths where you bought tickets for either of these places. Heaven was on the left and hell was on the right. Hell had a big amusement park where all these people were running around like mad. There were all sorts of noises, all sorts of rides and things, Ferris wheels and all. Heaven was the big huge library with all these people sitting around tables reading. My husband was attracted to the amusement park, and I surely thought we could go over there for a while and then go to the library if we felt like it. I knew that if we bought a ticket to go there that we would be stuck forever. We would never be able to get out. So we ended up going to the library. There was every book you could imagine about everything you could think of. So we just sat down and started reading. But I wondered after a while if we were going to do this forever. I asked somebody who seemed to have a little bit more authority or freedom or something where the boss of this place was. She made some sort of ambiguous remark. I asked her what she was doing thinking she would give some sort of reply that would let me know whether she was just a person like we were or if she were some angel or something special here. She was working with some filing cards, a whole lot of them. She didn't really explain to me what she was doing, but I told her that I used to work with things like that and I hoped that someday that they would let me do something a little bit special instead of just sitting around. Then the scene changed and I and my husband and a bunch of strangely assorted people that I don't know, but I guess maybe we were all from heaven, and we were just visiting here, were up in this cabin in the mountains. These were a bunch of strange people. There were a couple of older people in their 60's or 70's and an old man and old woman maybe some younger people around our age. We were here in this cabin and outside there was something strange and evil that wanted to get in. It was a group of people. We really didn't have any effective defense against them. First they came over in an airplane or something and then a couple of men drove up in this big truck and came up to the door. We tried to lock the doors, but they really wouldn't lock too well. We planned what we would do if anybody came like this so we had a couple of revolvers and things. So as these two men go out of the truck and started coming up to the house I started shooting this revolver at them. But it didn't seem to do any good at all. The revolver didn't shoot right or something. Then these two people, two boys, had this what they thought was a bright idea, but what I thought was a stupid idea of hooking this hose up from outside and aiming at them as they came in the door. They thought this would surely take care of them. this old man got behind the door with this revolver that he had loaded with gold bullets. He started shooting at them, but the bullets didn't hit them. These boys turned the hose on them. I don't remember exactly what happened after that. I don't think anything in particular did."
"022"	"(06/29/62)"	"The dream that I can remember had something to do with the Nazis. We were in this big hall listening to this speech by Hitler when we decided that we weren't going to stand for this or be part of it. So we got a whole bunch of suitcases from somewhere and some provisions which included a quart of buttermilk and stuck them in the back of a car and went off. Knowing that these people had seen us go, I asked my husband how he thought we were going to get away and I suggested the route out of the town that was less obvious than the one we were going to follow. He said it didn't make any difference because they had police all over the place anyhow. So I didn't understand how he thought we were going to get away. Anyhow we started off. There was a road across the bridge we were supposed to go across, but they were working on it, so they made a detour road consisting of two very winding lanes not on the same level with each other to go across the river at two different places. We were following the lower of these two roads. Then there's a movie. I have quite a few dreams which have sort of movie techniques. The scene was back at this great hall where this speech had been held. Hitler, or whoever it was, was saying to one of his companions, ""Have they been captured yet?"" Somebody said yes, we got them at such and such a place. Then my husband and I appeared on the scene. We were led in by somebody or other. It's really about as far as I remember."
"023"	"(06/29/62)"	"I was in somebody's house, a stranger's house. it was a little cozy house. I remember now it was one of my husband's relative's house--his cousin, whose mother had just died, my husband's aunt. I was telling her how to make refrigerator cookies so she could serve these to people who came around condoling her. Her mother's husband couldn't stand to live in the house any more where they lived, so he was going to sell it. There was something about a thruway that was supposed to go right thru where the house was, but he wasn't going to sell it to the thruway people. He didn't want to sell it to them. He was going to sell it to somebody else and everybody was trying to tell him that it was going to be impossible for him to do that. Well, at any rate, I went out to the front yard and there was a big magnolia tree. I was showing my husband the flowers when I noticed crawling on the branch something in a conch shell. I thought, ""What in the world could it be?"" I picked it up and it was a regular land snail, but it just was in a conch shell. On the shell were little places for its antennae and little eyes to fit into so when it crawled along, it could see where it was going. It was right cute because every once in a while it would have to lift its shell up and peer out to see where it was. I showed the snail to several people and I thought it was so cute and they thought it was horrible."
"024"	"(06/29/62)"	"The dream started off in my hometown at my parents' house where we were visiting. An old friend of ours, a woman in her late 30's, was coming down to see us and stay with us awhile. When she got there, there were these two men with her and there was something evil about these men. They planned to carry her off for some purpose of their own, I don't know exactly what. But these two men, at any rate, just came into the house and made themselves at home. Our friend told us about their plans, and we wanted to save her. These men were very suspicious and watchful. We felt that if they knew what we were trying to do, they would certainly find some way to stop us. We knew, for instance, that they had pistols. At last I found a way to tell my mother of the plot, not really sure that she would believe me, and persuaded her to call the police. Then came a sequence that has occurred to some extent in my dreams before of looking a number up in a telephone book and never being able to find the right number, and not being able to find the right place, and when you get there, find it is a different town or something. I told mother, ""This is the most confusing telephone book I've ever seen."" Finally, as it turned out, we had to call the operator, information, to get the right number, but we did. I guess the police said that somebody will have to come down there and tell us all about it before we can do anything because, at any rate, my husband and I went down to the police station. When we came there, thee was an old man sitting at an old desk, although the desk was the only thing in the whole place that looked like a police station. The rest of it looked like a big garage or car repair shop. We told him our problem: that this girl was going to be carried away by these two men. We just knew that this was going to happen and couldn't they please send out a couple of men and get these two, at least hold them for questioning or something. All the time we were wondering if these two characters might not have already taken her away. The man at the desk got two other men and they got in a car. They preceded us back. When we got there, the police weren't there. It seems perhaps they had come and gone or hadn't gone into the house or something. But these two men were trying to get our friend to go with them. They were strange people in the first place. They were sitting in the living room talking to each other and saying how each of them had a double heart. Now it seems they were using some sort of strange power, ESP power, over the mind of this girl, but they couldn't make any headway as long as she distracted herself, and she was distracting herself by reading something, just trying to be absorbed in something she was reading so they couldn't influence her. Exactly what happened after this, I'm not sure. But then I was walking down a long road or path. It seems I was coming back from school and had some books under my arm and was passing thru a factory district, at least there were big factory type buildings on either side. There were two, one on each side. They didn't have a dirty look of factories. They were set out in big open fields where it was green all around. Several other people were walking back the same way I was and we had to cross thru fences and things that were set up in the way. Then I passed a very strange place. There was a round enclosure and tall flag pole sort of thing I the middle of it. There was a fuse at the top of it that was burning and a couple of men standing there watching. I realized they were going to set off some sort of dynamite blast and I thought if these people are staying so close, it can't be so dangerous. But just the same, I walked down past on my little path for a ways. When I got under the shelter of a big tree, I turned around and looked. I heard the explosion, but I didn't see anything in particular. It seemed they were drilling for oil or something. I walked on and came to a place where I was supposed to cut off across the fields and some mountains, but the whole thing was covered with mist so that I couldn't se anything at all. Then a girl came up beside me and we decided we couldn't even cross the road because it was so misty that some car might hit us before we could see them or they could see us. So we would have to walk the long way down around the road. We were starting to do this and when we went around the curve and almost all of the mist seemed to have disappeared and it was all open and bright again. But for some reason we couldn't cut across the fields at this point because there was only one way to go. If we took any other way, we would lose our way. We were standing before a fence talking about it when all of a sudden a cow that was down in the pasture below, and this was on sort of a hillside so it was below us, jumped up and in just one leap it jumped over the fence beside us. We thought that any cow that could do this was pretty belligerent so we started running and it started running beside us and made another couple of huge impossible leaps for a cow to make. Then it made a leap trying to show how smart it was. Then there was a lady with a little baby in her arms sort of walking along or sitting there. The cow decided it would jump over these people, but it sort of missed and landed in the lady's lap. It didn't seem to hurt anybody very much. We stood there talking. I think my husband got into it again somehow. Then the lady was the friend who we tried to save from these people came by and somehow she had gotten away from them. She said something about if she only had her own car, that would have never happened."
"025"	"(06/30/62)"	"The dream concerned taking an hour quiz in some music. It was sort of a cross between a music course and a classics course. It wasn't exactly a classroom. It was sort of a long hall with desks and things lined up along the edges. A whole lot of people were sitting there, sort of cramming for it before the instructor came in to give us the quiz. The instructor was a little woman who reminds me somewhat of the plane geometry teacher I had in high school, and her reputation was that she always gave really easy quizzes so you should never really have any problem with them. She came in finally and gave out the quiz. It was pretty easy. I don't remember what the questions were, but I didn't seem to have any problem with them. The boy next to me broke his pencil and borrowed one from me, a green ballpoint. He seemed awfully intrigued that this was a green ballpoint. Then I told him it was good to use for graphs and things. Something strange happened then. There was this big sheet of paper in front of me. It was something of a cross between an actual scene and some sort of blueprint. You were supposed to copy this as well as you could. I don't remember if this was part of this quiz or was one of the draw-this-person type things. Anyway, I was trying to copy it."
"026"	"(06/30/62)"	"I remember going into a large building, something like a cross between a store and office building and a hotel. It was just around closing time. At least the sides were going in. My husband and I, perhaps it was just me, we went up a flight of stairs thru this big empty carpeted room, then down this little hall where there were some lamps still lighted. About the time we got to this hall we passed some employees putting on their coats and hats to leave. We went down this little hall and up another flight of stairs and across this waiting room or something like the NAACP, there was a Negro receptionist sitting behind the desk there and some chairs and coaches lined up against the wall. But we went right thru another little hall and I remember eating an apple. I wondered if it wasn't very nice for me to be munching on an apple as I walked past, then down thru another little hall which intersected with a larger one. There was a long bench like right in this hall across from this hall which we came out. A Negro girl was sitting there reading a magazine. She called to me as I was going past her. There was a door beside her and I was going to go in it for some reason. She said, ""Have you seen this?"" and she showed me a National Geographic magazine and in it were pictures of something I had remembered occurring a few weeks ago, but had no idea anybody would want to take pictures of it. It was a scene that had to do something with this friend of mine and her mother, neither of whom I care for too much. They were dressed alike. There were several other people in this room. What was going on in that room didn't make much sense to me as I look back on it. It seems that these people were getting ready to go to Europe or something like that, which in actual life they are. Maybe this was a little send-off committee or something, but my friend and her mother were presented these big pillows by somebody or another. They were very happy with them. Then my friend wanted to know if it wasn't something or other. Her mother said no, it was a travelogue. My friend was very unhappy about it and started saying she didn't think that was very much of a present. Her mother was trying to hush her up because it wasn't very nice of her to say that when she had been given it in front of all these people who had presented it to her. At any rate, in this magazine, there were some scenes, some pictures of her and her mother. I started looking to see if by any chance a picture of me had gotten in there, but it hadn't. When I remembered this scene in my mind, I went into the little room which I had been going to go in before this girl stopped me. This was the room where it had happened and it seemed to have happened right then. It's sort of a combination of remembering it and happening right then. I went back out again and I left my apple sitting beside this girl, and I said, ""Oh, I've left it, haven't it?"" and I picked it up and started eating on it again. What happened after this isn't very clear. There were quite a few scenes with Negro people. It was something to do with integration, tolerance, etc."
"027"	"(07/01/62)"	"In the first part of the dream I was walking down the street in back of the one we live on with my daughter. It wasn't exactly like the street I use in back of our house. At any rate, we walked down the street. On the left we came to a house that was empty. The people moved out of it. There was a woman standing in front of it. I just sort of ignored her and walked on into the house with my daughter because I had brought her down here so we could both take a shower and not mess up our own. Although this house was empty and the people moved out of it, there were still some curtains on the windows. I closed these curtains in this bathroom, which wasn't really a bathroom but a big square room with a rectangular recess in one part. The floor was covered with cement and it was just like a very big shower. Then I figured it out that I was going to get under this main shower and put my daughter in the rectangular cut-out place for her to have her shower. I don't remember that we exactly did take our shower, but anyway, as we were coming back, we passed a house that these friends of ours, a couple of years younger than us, had lived in, but had moved out of for the summer. They actually sublet the place, but in my dream it was empty except for some few things of theirs that were in it. We thought we'd go in and see if they had any mail or anything we might be able to take them. So we did. Now my husband was with me, but not our daughter. We looked around and saw some toys and things. We got involved in moving a whole lot of things around. We found a couple of letters for them. We started looking thru this Consumer's Union magazine and they had a report on toys. It was unusual for the CU magazine. It was in color. They were pretty vivid colors too, oranges, bright blues. Of course, all my dreams are in color, but these were somewhat more vivid than the usual colors of my dreams. At any rate, we see they're having a report on toys, like tricycles, and these cars that little children pedal and things like that. Then they said, ""We must really get up some sort of force behind us and do something about these Wright Bros., these manufacturers of toy airplanes for children."" They told us that they are perfectly harmless, but they are very dangerous because it showed a picture of this airplane. It was roughly like these old airplanes. They said it had something like a half-ton motor in it and could climb up to 10,000 feet, and it could go for 2 miles. So it really would be dangerous. These people were trying to say that a 6 or 10-year-old child could handle the thing. So we read about that for a while and then some other vague things."
"028"	"(07/02/62)"	"The duke and his wife--the duke of something or other, I don't know his title--had a large castle at El Sin Or, where Hamlet used to live. Because their castle is so famous, they gave TV shows every once in a while so people could see this famous place. The duchess gave one, one time. She had a whole troupe of actors in and she and the actress both took the same part and played it over. It was sort of an Othello part, only this wasn't the name that was given to it. The duke didn't approve of this at all, and was very short to her and thought she had been very stupid to do this. The duke, to get back at his wife, found this young mistress somewhere and told his wife he was going off with her, and did go off at least for the night anyhow. This upset her very much because she supposedly loved him very much. He was about 25 and she a year or so younger. I guess it couldn't have upset her too much because she went off the next day on a fishing trip with this young man a few years older than herself who looked exactly like our mailman, who is young and good-looking. They went off to the lake and then, though they had a rod and reel, they forgot to get any bait. So she went back to the little refreshment stand where they had different types of bait for sale. She bought a dozen earthworms, which they tried to charge some fantastic price--$1.80 or something, but she only had 50 cents. When she came back, her friend had thrown a line out into the water and there was a fish on it. She hauled it in with her hands. They fished a little longer, but without any luck. Then she went home. Now in this dream the reason I've been using these 3rd person pronouns was the fact that my point of view shifted back and forth between these two people. At first it was more or less the duke, then it was the duchess, which is about where it stayed. So I guess from now on, I'll say, ""I."" When I went home, my husband, who seemed rather aloof about anything which I was going to do, was sort of distressed that I had gone off with this man. He reminded me that in the next few days was our anniversary and it was sort of like a bleak prospect. I started going thru all my clothes trying to find something I could wear, wondering where we could go."
"029"	"(07/02/62)"	"I was the guest in someone else's house and didn't have anything to do for a while, so I was looking thru their supply of books and ran across a couple by this young girl. At any rate, the story was that this girl was about 15 and that this boy was about 19 and they had fallen in love. She had borne a child to him and they weren't married. He was in love with her and wanted to live with her and support the two, but she wouldn't hear of it and left him for a while. But later she came back again and had another child by him and left him again. But finally she came back to him and consented to marry him. Sometime after they were married, she had another child and this time she left him for good. I believe she had written the story about her experiences and she had written it also. It seemed to have some sort of strange reverse moral and that he was the one that wanted to marry her and that she was the one that left him."
"030"	"(07/03/62)"	"I dreamed that my husband and I were in the big department store in my hometown and they just put a whole rack of winter clothes, coats, robes and things. They weren't even sized right or put on the racks. I was looking at the winter coats and seeing what kind I might like to have if we could afford to get one. The saleslady was helping me. For some reason I thought I wanted a white coat. I looked at several of these and all different sorts of coats. I also tried on some robes. We must have spent a long time in the store with me trying on coats and everything. I know we didn't really have in my mind that we were going to buy one, and I don't know why we were spending so long."
"031"	"(07/03/62)"	"Something had happened to our car, or at least it wasn't there. We had to go over to a nearby college  town, which is about 8 miles away. So we were riding bicycles, my husband and I. We were on the main highway for quite a while and then we took this dirt road. It was a country road and it had this number 1,000 on it. I knew for certain that it intersected with this other state highway, 954, which is where we eventually wanted to go, what we thought would be a good way to go. It was about 35 miles to where this intersected, but it didn't seem such a far distance. We were bicycling along down this road, which was gravel. There were farms on either side. Before we went down it very far, we came to this stone house, sort of set back from the road with a big picture window. On that picture window was this stone relief of this flapper type. I told my husband that that was a house of ill repute. Somehow I knew all about it. As we went on past, I told him that at one time this place had some connection with the church. I had been out there on some sort of a church function. Then it became a beauty shop and I'd been there one time. Now it was the house of prostitution and I'd never been there. We kept on riding and riding and started to get pretty tired. We came to a little crossroads which said it was 17 miles to the intersection where we wanted to go and then it was another long distance to back home. So I think we left our bikes there and walked back toward this house. When we got there, it was almost evening, and there were quite a few barrack-type houses set up all around now. So we got a room in one of these. It got dark and we tried to go to sleep. But I thought it was awfully hot and stuffy in the room, so I got up and crawled out thru the window and started walking around. Everybody was asleep except in this house of prostitution. You could look into the picture window and hear all the prostitutes sitting around this big table playing cards and the madam walking around. I was so fascinated and intrigued. I was watching them, but I didn't want them to see me out there because I thought they might not like anybody around like that. So I walked down some path and came to a larger one which went up this mountain. I started walking up it, but I was a little bit worried because I was barefooted and there was lots of broken glass around and it was pretty hard to see because it was dark. But I walked on and every once in a while I would meet somebody else on the path. Finally I got up to a point where it was really dark and the road went in 2 directions. Neither of them looked very sensible so I turned around and started to come back down. I met a woman who had been in a class of mine the preceding semester. She audited it. She's probably in her late 30's. I didn't particularly want her to see me so I started walking along, but she caught up with me and recognized me and started talking about classes and everything as we were going back down the path. When we got back to the bottom, there was a big room or something and she got quite belligerent and started shouting to me about different courses. Not understanding my answers, I'd have to shout back. I was sort of embarrassed because there were other people in the room. Then I believe I met another woman who I had worked with one time up in the Biology Dept. She also is in her late 30's. I started telling her that I had practically my master's thesis in biology, but I had done this psychology study on conditioning some rats. Then I was in this big room with a med student that I had known. All these people were working on their theses. I was going to work on mine too. These people were all typing up their theses, and all were going to do just one draft and they were going to have it done because they knew exactly what to say. I was trying to do it, but I soon realized it wasn't possible and I was going to have to type it over again. My husband came in at some point or another and we talked to second woman I had met. We sort of hinted to her that it would be nice if she would drive us down the road to where our bicycles were and pick them up and take us back to my university town. But she didn't seem to get the hint too well."
"032"	"(07/04/62)"	"I don't exactly where we were, but my brother and my sister were there and my husband. I don't believe my parents were. I and my brother and my sister must have all been about 4 or 5 years younger than we actually are because we were all acting rather childish. What we were going to do was to leave home because we thought we weren't being treated right. We had to sneak away a little bit because if these people caught us. It wasn't just our parents, it was somebody else--these big guardians. They would try to keep us from going. At any rate we were going to leave and my husband was trying to keep me from going. At any rate we were going to leave and my husband was trying to keep me from going. I said I was going because I didn't think that he really loved me. He said, ""Yes, I do. I love you for your"" something or other and I can't remember what, but I wish I could. I said that just shows it. You don't love me for me. So we left and we all walked down this little path until we came to this place where they were constructing a road. They were doing it in sort of a strange way. They had this road built almost over to meet this path and apparently it was going to turn and go up this path at practically a right angle. From the end of the cement over to about the path they had lain this thin flat piece of metal and some Negro men were standing at the far end of it on the path, way down on the road quite a distance another man was standing with a piece of similar metal. We knew that before we could get past these people that we would have to have little broken off pieces of the metal at the right length. We weren't quite sure how we were going to go about getting it."
"033"	"(07/04/62)"	"This dream involves me and my husband and some person called a mother-in-law although it's not my mother or his mother. It's more like my father's mother. She's been dead for several years. At any rate we three were in the mountains at a park such as the Great Smokies. I think we were going on some sort of a camping trip together, but this mother-in-law wanted to have complete control over it. There was something to do with a will. She was going to bequeath such and such. Whether she was going to give it to us or not, I don't know. She was a wealthy old woman, but I didn't want to have her tell us what to do, so I said, ""I'm not going to go with you. I'm going on my own camping trip."" So they went to one place and I went to another. There was a big valley and 2 big mountains sloped up on either side. They started from the far mountain and I started from the closer one. We were both going down to the valley. That was 2 parts of the park, some sort of rectangular parts. Then over to the right of these were 2 more parts which were something like it. They were going to sort of work their way down toward one and I was going to work my way down toward the other one. It was quite a long distance and I was surprised that I covered it in one day. I was sure they probably wouldn't have, but when I looked over there they were setting up their camp and all. I was sort of mad. There was a lake between us. There were some ducks in this lake and it seems that one of the park wardens or somebody was telling me I could perform some great service by helping these ducks. I didn't know exactly what he meant. A pair of them came toward me pushing their nest thru the water to a more safe place. They wanted to anchor it down with mud because it seems a rival male duck would fight over the nest and try to break them away. So you had to anchor them down. So I helped this duck for quite a while finding clay and patting it down around the edge of the nest. Somehow it had something to do with a place that was a cross between a library and a drugstore. They were short of hands and they needed somebody to work there for a while and my husband was going to. He said he would take somebody's place who was going to be away. They set a time for him to be there. We went back to my university town and he called this place and asked the man if he should come in. The man was really nasty to him and said they had plenty of people and for him just not to bother. We didn't understand why he was going to do this."
"034"	"(07/04/62)"	"We went to look at some kittens last night and this is probably the reason. It seems there was a big room which seemed to be a room inside some cheap hotel, but at the same time it seemed to be a display room for a pet shop because lined up along the sides of this were boxes where you were supposed to keep cats in, where they were supposed to live, a cozy little box in which to live in. The advertisement was slanted toward the cats and I don't exactly know how they accomplished this, but it was written in cat language although I could read it. According to their prices, these boxes were outfitted in various ways. For instance each of them had a little heater and air circulator and a little light that worked on the inside and had a little motor. Many of them had additional devices. They had a record of various things that ran continuously. One of them had a record of a mouse squeaking. One had a record of a contented cat purring or washing its face or something so that the cat would feel right at home there. After I looked at these for a while I went into another room for a while I believe and upside down standing on the ceiling somehow some cats and some mice were getting ready to have a boxing contest. They looked like cats and mice from a Tom and Jerry cartoon. There were quite a few real cats sitting down around me watching it. Of course, they were all confident that the cats were going to win. They were very surprised when the cats didn't win. Then as part of this dream, but entirely different in tone from it, came a series of incidents which I can't remember the connecting thread of now. It was a scene in some little eating place. It was some sort of a gangster type mystery in which there were all these little secret signs and things going on."
"035"	"(07/04/62)"	"I dreamed that my husband and I had gone to the art museum here in my university town to look at the exhibits. We got in the door and for some reason I don't remember what I was carrying. I had this long electric cord that led to something outside of the museum library and I had to get enough of it in the door when people opened the door so I could walk around seeing all the parts of the museum. Later it must have just disappeared. I don't know what it was. I was looking at all the different paintings. They had an exhibit of different stringed musical instruments. They had some awfully lovely guitars and some other things they called harpsichords, but they weren't harpsichords at all. They were crescent shaped things like a moon which had sort of a wedge like a watermelon slice. From the tips of the crescent down the length of it strings would be strung and there were 12 of them. This was what they were calling a harpsichord and I thought that would be fun to learn how to play. A little later on I noticed a book about these various instruments including their cost. I started reading and I thought I found something about the harpsichord. I was reading alone. They had a lot of songs and the things you would play them with, the chords and all that you could use. Then I found what I was reading about was a player piano and I thought that was kind of strange since they didn't have one on exhibit there. They had very strange things about it. They told you how to use it so it would look like you were really playing the piano. They told you how you could make comic scenes involving it. I thought this must have been written quite a while ago because they have some pictures in it that seem to date from the early part of the century. Then I found the part about this harpsichord. They gave quite a few old English-type ballad songs with the various chords you would use. I got involved in reading the things and wondering what the tunes were because they just gave the words with some little pictures beside them, but they didn't have the notes. I got real caught up in these ballads and was sort of seeing a couple of them acted out in front of me."
"036"	"(07/05/62)"	"The dream started off in Chicago at the airport. My husband and I apparently just arrived here by plane. I guess he had some sort of psychological meeting here. He was telling me how convenient Chicago's airport was because it was right in the center of town. Of course, I know this isn't really true, but we seemed to be looking down on it. We could see, indeed, how it was in the center of town and close to the University of Chicago, which seemed to be all around it. There was an immense plane on the field. It was just enormous. It was some sort of special jet. It wasn't a passenger jet, but something they use in the army. Somebody was telling us about it and took us out to see it. It flew some immense distance up in the air. It seems like it was 20 miles, and stayed cleaner than other planes because it wasn't exposed to dust and stuff in the lower atmosphere. We started out of the airport. Everything that happened in this early part of the dream was like a cross between its actually happening to me and hearing about it or seeing a movie about it. It's as if I watched these things happen while somebody was reading about them to me or lecturing on them. I was being told about this big mental hospital that was connected with the University, I believe. I saw this hospital. They were telling about the escapes. It was sort of on the order of the Lexington Narcotics Hospital in people were being treated were prisoners too. There were bars on the windows and everything. They talked about people trying to escape. Then I was out walking around this building on this wide wing that was on about the second story level trying to be real inconspicuous. I didn't want any guard to see me because if they saw me, they would shoot at me. This happened for a while. Then I had sort of a story about myself. It seems that I was a robber, but I really wasn't guilty. These two people who had planned it all had gotten away and were very angry because I slipped up or something. They were after me. The scene shifts back from Chicago to my university town. It was night and I was alone in our apartment. I heard somebody at the back door and it was these people with guns. It seems that while I was a man in the first part of the dream, now I was myself again. I closed the door. Then one of them ran around to the front door. So I was sort of tricked. I told them they couldn't do that. It was wrong. They couldn't just murder anybody like that. Then these two people were familiar. One of them was my older brother and the other was familiar to me, but I don't remember who he is. I was so shocked that my brother was trying to kill me and I couldn't understand it. It seemed that it wasn't only these people now that they had become familiar, but there still seemed to be some shadowy characters in the background who were also after me. It seems I got over next door somehow in my neighbor's apartment and was telling her my dilemma. I was thinking of all the things I could possibly do, like just go away from there altogether and try to go someplace else where I wasn't known and just sort of hide out. It was a terrible situation to be in. It seemed nobody could really help me very much. While I was in this neighbor's apartment, my brother came knocking on the door over here with a pistol in his hand, and they kept him out. My neighbor said she was going to call the police. First my brother said, ""It's high time she came out of there because it's 9:17."" My neighbor dialed time service and they said it was 9:15 and she sort of told him that, with sort of a ha-ha. Then he was quiet for a minute. He was standing outside the front door. Then she said she was going to call the police, but it seemed it was somebody else she knew personally. She was going to take me and my brother to talk to this man to see if he couldn't straighten out the difficulty between us, whatever it was. It seemed sort of funny because this was the point where something was going to be straightened out in this dream, then I woke up and was more sad than scared because it was so terrible that my own brother would be trying to kill me and I very rarely have dreams that I wake up from, but I did from this."
"037"	"(07/05/62)"	"My husband and I were going to do our weekly shopping at the shopping center where we always shop and my husband told me that another grocery store opened up out there. Sure enough, there was. It was another A&P right beside the one that's already out there. It was a little bit smaller. It seemed rather strange to me that they would have a second A&P there, but I decided to get in it just to see what it's like. I thought probably a lot of other people would too since it was an A&P, and people who shop at one would probably shop at another. So I went in it and although I don't think I've ever been in the store in real life, it seems like I must have been in it in another dream because the layout of the store was familiar to me and it was rather not like you usually find in a grocery store. The spices and flour were in one place. But at any rate, I looked thru this grocery store and contrary to any of my expectations, there were very few people in it. It was a small store and I thought maybe they needed some business, but I was going to have to go to the other store because they didn't have everything I wanted. When I got to the meat counter, I was astonished, there were very little meat cuts that I recognized. There was a lot of fish. I ended up getting some round steak and flounder. While I only got these 2 things, I got 3 packages. Somehow that seemed quite right to me at the time. Then I went to the checkout counter in this little store and checkout corner, where it should have been, was sort of a cafeteria. There were several tables and booths around for people who come shopping to have their lunch. Then a boy came up and took my cart and took it back into this office and closed the door behind him to add up my food, then present me with the bill and then bring it to the car. It was a rather unusual procedure, but I went into another room and sat down and there were quite a few people sitting around there. The boy with the groceries was gone. I think I finally got up and went out thinking he would follow me eventually, and started looking for our car and also my husband. It seems I finally found them both and we were sitting in the car waiting for the groceries to be brought."
"038"	"(07/05/62)"	"I'm taking this course in drama and it seems I was reading this play, sort of a combination between Ipsen and Strenberg and it was supposed to be sort of a grim play about this man who died and his young daughter about 7 who worshipped him, and how he said all sorts of cruel things before he died, and she's all upset and disillusioned and ruined for life. And about her mother--something sort of strange about her. This is the type of thing that happens fairly often in my dreams. While I knew I was sort of reading this play and actually I was reading a page every so often, I was sort of watching it from this superior position and I was also taking part in it. It seems I was more involved with the mother and this daughter than anybody else. It was strange and hard to remember anyway. It seems the girl was about 17 and she was a very good pianist and she wanted to date these boys that were around the house. It seems strange that even though her father died all these years ago, he was still there. He was dictating should and shouldn't do, telling her she wasn't going to date these boys. But the mother was saying, ""I think she should be allowed to date every once in a while."" He was being real mean about it. These 3 characters shifted around until they were very like my mother and my father and my sister. I don't know what happened. I think she finally got to date who she wanted to."
"039"	"(07/06/62)"	"This first dream takes a little bit of explanation. It was about the neighbors in the apartment next to ours and he is Mexican. He's about 32 and she's from Ohio, around 25-years-old. He has a real bad temper and also has this idea that man is the very dominant one in the marriage and children should be seen and not heard. She is sort of strange because she never raises her voice when he's around, but when he's not there, she'll shout at the children herself. The dream I had seemed sort of ridiculous, but it was horrifying at the time. I dreamed that we didn't live in quite the apartment we live in now, more like one we lived in several years ago in which the bedroom was next to the apartment beside it. I was in bed at night fairly late and couldn't get to sleep. My husband was out somewhere and hadn't come home yet. This couple were going to leave the next day, she to go up to Illinois for a while and he was going to Mexico, which, in fact, is going to happen in a few days. All of a sudden I heard him shouting at her. I was sort of horrified and aghast because when he gets angry, he sounds as if he is going to kill somebody. He was chasing her around the apartment. I could hear because I could hear these footsteps. She was never raising her voice at him, sort of trying to pacify him the way you would a child or someone who is insane. It went on for quite a while. He shouted at her. Finally it stopped and my husband came home and I started telling him about it. It doesn't seem like so much when I remember it, but I remember it was a real horrifying sort of dream."
"040"	"(07/06/62)"	"The dream started out in my hometown at the art museum. I was standing sort of at the door to it at the top of the steps. There was a mail box there. The mailman who delivers our mail here came up to it and put some letters in the box. I started looking at them. Most of them were sort of advertising circulars. Somehow the scene changed while I was still looking at letters so that we were in a nearby college town in the apartment we first lived in after we got married. I was there with some old woman. She had just come because her suitcases were outside. My husband had gone off somewhere. My daughter was sleeping across the hall, not in what was our apartment. As a matter of fact, the room wasn't in that place in the real apartment. I was in the living room with this old woman in her 60's and she was sort of crotchety. I don't know who she was. She was some relative or other of mine or my husband. She was drinking tea. She asked me to please get her some more, so I did. The mailman apparently had gone around to the back of the house for something. There was another apartment back there and maybe he was delivering mail there. I went in to see if my daughter was waking up and he came in there and we started talking. It was real friendly conversation about something or other. We came back into our apartment. I brought back my daughter. We kept on talking and in this friendly way. I started wondering to myself exactly what his intentions were. What was he doing in here at all? What was I going to do? About the time I was thinking this, the old woman who now seemed to be something of a landlady, said, ""Yes, it's always been so nice that the people living in the apartment have found such nice friends. I never heard anything unseemly going on and if anything unseemly goes on, the people go out."""
"041"	"(04/08/62)"	"I was on the university campus walking toward the psych building. I went in and went upstairs to the ladies' room there. Quite a few of the people in the building experimented in this drug experiment and I kept asking people as I met them if they had taken the drug or not."
"042"	"(07/08/62)"	"I was in an airplane and I don't know where I started from or where I was going. It does seem that I was going out to Topeka. I was by myself. This man in his late 20's or a little older came and  sat down and started making these passes at me and I tried to discourage him the best I could, but nothing seemed to stop him and he was very persistent. The people around me noticed I was being bothered by this person, but they didn't seem inclined to do very much about it. Finally he did get up, I believe, and move to another seat. I went up and complained to the stewardess. I told her I didn't want this person sitting beside me again. She seemed pretty annoyed that I would bother her. She sort of grudgingly agreed that she would help me. I was afraid of this man, not only because he made a pass at me, but because there was something evil about him and he had some big grudge against me or something. I knew that when we got to the airport he would try to follow me and that I had to get out quick. He had the seats in front of me, both of which were empty and made them recline so that I was very uncomfortable and I was getting ready to call the stewardess, but I didn't see that she could do very much about it. When we were getting ready to land, everybody had to get up and unfasten their safety belts. We landed and were coasting in toward the airport when I suddenly noticed I couldn't find my pocket book. So I went up to the stewardess and told her somewhere on this plane I had lost my pocket book. She acted like I had just brought this up to annoy her, but she came back and helped me look for it. Somehow it had slipped way under the seat and even though I looked under the seat, that's where it was. She looked at me as if I were some sort of mental defective. Everybody was getting off the airplane and getting these slips of paper to get their luggage with or something. Then somebody else at the airport was collecting it with a little clip. I was trying to hurry just as fast as I could. This was a huge, enormous building the airport was in. I was trying to hurry and get lost in the crowd before this person could catch up with me, wherever he was. I looked around and didn't see anybody that looked like him, yet it was hard for me to remember exactly what he had looked like. I went into the airport and I knew it would be a while before we could get our baggage and get out of here, so I thought I would look for a snack bar and get a coke or something. There wasn't one, but there was an immense cafeteria and restaurant with more food and more people in it than I had ever seen anywhere. I looked in there and considered going in and getting something, but I decided against it. I went to the ladies' room here and several people came in and talked to me while I was going to the bathroom, including a couple of boys. I thought I should have been embarrassed at this but I wasn't particularly. Then I went walking down some corridors, remaining vaguely worried about this person who might be following me. Then I woke up, but I did get back to sleep and I dreamed some more about it. Now it was sort of watching the action occur. I was partly identified with the girl who is being chased by this man. The dream seemed to be set in the very early part of the century because the girl was dressed in a long dress. Anyway, she came into the room, a hotel or something, and noticed a man there of her acquaintance and another girl about her age, which was in her middle 20's. She asked the man if he would help her please because this person was following her. She wanted to go get some candy from one of the vending machines, but she didn't want to take her wallet with her because it had all her money and everything in it. If this man who had been chasing her came in and asked for any money, he was not to be given any and told to wait till she came back. So she took a penny and went off to buy some peppermint candy and she didn't come back. So the police were asking this man now about the last of the incidents that led up to her disappearance and he told them this."
"043"	"(07/08/62)"	"I was on campus and walking toward the hospital and some man was walking along with me, and I was going to help find or get something when we got to the hospital. First I had to go into this building next to the hospital and get a picture which had been taken of me a couple of years ago for the annual or something. So I went into the building and went up to one of the girls and told them I wanted to get this picture. Then it seems that I already had it and it was just a tiny little picture. What I had to do was pay for it, and I had to pay $2 for it, which seems like a high price for a tiny little picture, but it didn't seem particularly excessive to me. Then I went on out and went over to the hospital. By this time the man had disappeared. Exactly how this came about, I don't' remember, but when I went into the hospital, I met a girl I had known in school who is working over there now. We started talking and she suggested we go over to the snack bar and get a coke or something. So we got a coke and some crackers. Then I believe we went over somewhere to eat this and talk. We heard an announcement that everybody in the hospital was in danger of getting this disease. It was some sort of flu-like disease, I guess, but it was caused by this woman who was the cashier in the cafeteria and snack bar. Whether she spread it or whether it was because she was careless and sloppy in some manner or another, I don't know. Anyway, everybody was warned and I was sort of mad that I was exposed to this disease and I thought I was already getting it."
"044"	"(07/09/62)"	"I dreamed I was in New York and I was watching this man who was standing on the sidewalk selling some tiny poodles. They looked like poodles and that's what he was calling them, but they were about the size of Chihuahuas. A lady came along with a little poodle of her own and she said her poodle needed a companion, so she'd buy one and how much were they? $5. She thought that was pretty reasonable, so she'd take this particular one. Then the man put it into this paper sack with this leash and said that would be $7, $1 for the sack and $1 for the leash. She paid it. Her car was right across the street. It was a little green VW. Then they went over and she got in. I got in somehow and it was in the back seat. The man put the dog in the back seat. Then when he was getting out, he put it in a big pocket of his coat and walked back. I figured this was his racket. I told the lady what he had done. Then I ran down to this policeman who was standing on the corner and told him exactly what happened. The man had to give the dog back. Then something complicated happened because now my husband and I were here and we were doing something on the street for some reason. It was almost 5 in the afternoon. The policeman said we had better get out of here while we could because the 5 o'clock traffic jam was going to start in a few minutes. Right now we could make a but U-turn and go back the way we came and when the rush started, we wouldn't be able to turn around anywhere for about 20 miles. Somehow we didn't get turned around in time and then I was walking the way we would have gone. I understood why you couldn't turn because it was a tiny road. It was much too small for a car as far as that went. It was out along the bay and there was this overhanging cliff which was so low down that you could hardly even walk on the road. I was walking along the edge of the water. We walked along and went somewhere to meet some other people. It was rather pretty. There were trees and the grass was real green and there were various kinds of birds around. I just kept walking down this little road."
"045"	"(07/09/62)"	"the dream took place in my university town. It's rather confused what happened exactly, but it seems there was some huge windstorm that had done something rather strange. It opened another passage into the town or something. I didn't know exactly what this meant, but I wanted to go see it. My husband didn't much want to, but I persuaded him finally that we should drive out and go looking for it. I didn't know what sort of windstorm it was, but nothing seemed to be damaged. It was only this one place wherever it was. As we drove along, we came to a house beside a lake and apparently we had been invited to a cocktail party although we didn't' know these people. But we got out and went in and had a drink. Then we went out and walked out onto his dock on this lake and stood around for a while. Then we finally left. We were driving around this lake when we came to a place where the bridge was partly broken down. The water was running over it. We figure this must be what they meant about another passage into town, but that didn't make much sense."
"046"	"(07/09/62)"	"This very old woman was going up these very steep stairs to this little store which sold liquor and some other groceries too. She was carrying back some bottles to redeem. I was watching her and then I felt sort of ashamed of myself for not helping her, so I took the bottles from her. The deposit she was getting on them was $1.60. I asked her if she wanted to buy anything and she sad no. Then she decided to get some pork chops and a loaf of bread. Then we started down and this time an old friend of mine from my hometown, who is he same age, but whom I haven't seen in about 5 years, was with us. We were walking back down the stairs and the stairs were made out of boxes of cookies. The first flight of stairs seemed made out of Pepperidge Farm packages of cookies. Then the rest of the stairs were made out of different ones. The old lady sort of faded out of the picture on the way down and this girl and I were talking. When we got near the ground, we saw this party of people who were all friends of ours but I didn't know them at the time. There was going to be a wedding that day. We were going to come back and see it maybe. Then this girl and I walked on. We were walking along the ocean front and the waves were very big. Even though we were walking sort of out of the way, they would come up around our waists and sort of drag us out. It was sort of unpleasant. We weren't particularly scared. They were just huge waves and didn't look the way waves really look because they would be triangular shape sort of and lots of them would rise up at one time. As we walked along, we were thinking about going to this sort of amusement park if we could find some money somewhere because we thought that would be fun. Then somehow we were back near the steps we came down originally and here was the bridal couple who had just been married. Then we were in the church where they had been married, which was also the house of one of them. It was very strange because the couple, although it didn't seem very strange to me, they were these 2 girlfriends of mine, neither of whom know each other actually. One of them was a little girl when I was real little who was about 5 years older than me and another girl who's my same age. The friend that I was with asked her mother if she could go to the fair and she said no, we couldn't go now, but maybe we could go later on tonight. So we were "
"047"	"(07/10/62)"	"I dreamed about our next door neighbors and the wife's parents and sister who had come down to see them, which in fact happened yesterday. And I dreamed that these people belonged to some funny religious sect, some sort of fundamentalist thing which I've been told they do. But at any rate, I went over to see them and it was in the evening, and everybody was sitting around and we were all going to sing hymns. They were going to be led by the girl's father and there was no music or anything, and I didn't know any of these hymns, but you had to sing them just right. I was sort of upset by this because I didn't feel like I could do it. But we sang a few anyway and I think I noticed at this time that they had a big aquarium sitting over in one part of the house with some tropical fish in it which didn't seem to be getting along too well, and I presume that her parents had brought these with them from their home. It seems like it was the next morning and my neighbor came over to tell me that all of her fish were dying. What they were going to do with them, they had a little flower garden out in their front yard and rain water stood in it and they were going to put these fish in it, and I didn't think that was a very good idea because if they were dying in the aquarium, it seem like this would be even worse for them, but she was sort of insistent and that they were going to do it. I looked at the place that she meant, and it was, at fist it just looked like some muddy puddles among some flowers, and then it became a little pond, a little fish pond with several types of fish swimming around init and with this funny-looking creature which I called a glass snake, but I don't think it was such a thing. As a matter of fact, I don't think there's any such thing around. It looked somewhat like a larval eel in that it was completely transparent, and you could see just right through it, and you could see all of its internal organs because they were of a different color, but it was a strange little animal. Well, it looked like it was only a foot or so long, and it looked like it couldn't hurt anybody, still it acted so vicious that we were sort of afraid of it. And I told my husband about it. That we couldn't go over there because there was a glass snake in their yard, and he didn't seem very impressed and he wanted me to draw him a picture of it and so I drew him one."
"048"	"(07/10/62)"	"The dream is very strange and sort of a science fiction story, sort of a scary thing in which first I was sort of removed from it and then I was identified with one of the characters. It seems that there were these few children, and they were in this big stone house, practically a palace, somewhere, and they were sort of the last survivors of the world from this horrible growth that had taken over everything. There was the little vine-like growth with all sorts of tendrils and everything that crowded every place it could and killed everything living there. It just covered the whole world, just about. But it hadn't gotten in her yet, and the reason was these children had some sort of strange light and they later called it a chlorophyll light which, if they shone it on the tendrils of the vine, repelled it so it would go away. And the vine was attracted to any other type of light. If you had any type of light on, the vine would try to come in. So they had tried to close all the windows and everything. They were in this one big room, about 3 or 4 stories off the ground, and they were leaving one window open and they were going to sort of train the chlorophyll light on it so that these things wouldn't get in. And apparently they thought it would take quite some time before the vines would probably die because they had gotten everything else on earth and so they would die after a few weeks or so. Then the children could come out. But this chlorophyll light was run by batteries. It was sort of like a flashlight. And so there was danger that it might run down, but they were hoping to find something else to combat this vine with. As the dream went on, instead of its being a vine, it was some strange race of people, humanoids who were -- well, they weren't exactly cannibalistic because they weren't the same type of, same species of human beings. And they were very wiry and they were impossible to kill and they could climb up the walls and slither into these tiny little places in the floor around this window. But if you shone this light at them, they would go away for a few minutes, but then they came back and they were very strong. And so everybody was fighting these things. And I was the one who had the flashlight, the chlorophyll light. I didn't want to use it too much and down below the ground there was a director. I struggled with them a long time shining the light at the people long enough to make them go. Then I tried an experiment. I held one of them and just kept blinking the light into its eyes, and its eyes sort of turned this glowing green and the whole animal, person, thing, was sort of wrecked, and driven insane and so then I couldn't and didn't fight any more. And so then you could just throw them out of the window and they'd die then they hit the ground. So this was pretty successful, but I knew it would run the batteries down before too long and there were just swarms of these creatures outside. So I had an idea. I called this other person and asked them to bring me this (strobe?) light that was over near another window which had been closed down and they were afraid to go over there by themselves away from the chlorophyll light to get it, and I didn't want to leave the light with this person because these creatures were getting smarter and they were trying to get away because if they did, it would, they, we would be in their power. But anyway, I finally got the strobe light, and when I shone, turned it on -- well, it wasn't a strobe light. It was a rotating disc, and when I shone this light through the rotating disc like the right light, it seems that it made it hundreds of times more intense so that I didn't have to be right beside one of these creatures to shine the light in their eyes. I could do it from a distance, and I even got the leaders on the ground and everything. And so that sort of finished them off."
"049"	"(07/13/62)"	"It seems that my husband had gotten his Ph.D. and we were going to have to move from this married students housing that we live in. And so we were trying to decide how big a house we were going to have. And there was this little plot of land nearby where we could have somebody come and set us up, mark us off an area of any size that we said might be the interior of a house. So we were figuring out how many rooms we wanted and how big each room was going to be and everything. And we came out with this, it didn't seem perfectly fantastic in the dream, but it does now. We decided that our house was going to be about 40 feet wide and 1,200 feet long. So we were going then to see this contractor to set up this framework and then we were going out to see if this would be an adequate size for us or not. But I thought, what they did was just to mark it off and put sort of a little rope around the area. I thought it was going to be awfully hard to judge that way without having the actual house there."
"050"	"(07/13/62)"	"It seems that a nearby university was going to put on these three sort of permanent pageants. What they were putting on was a cross between three pageants -- King Arthur and His Knights and Alice in Wonderland  --  and I decided that I was going to see the first of these. So I went over and the admission was a nickel, but there didn't seem to be anybody particular around to give it to. But I saw a woman sitting down in one of the first few rows toward the back who seemed as though she might be the one to pay and so I did. You also had reserve seats and mine was right down near the front, so I went down and sat down. There weren't a whole lot of people in the auditorium which wasn't like the nearby university's auditorium anyhow. It wasn't like anyone I had been in particularly. But at any rate some girl came and sat beside me and it seemed like I knew her from somewhere. And it started. And there was nothing particularly funny. And what happened was this boy rode this imitation horse on the stage and fell off it a few times like the Knight in Through the Looking Glass. Everybody thought that this was hilarious though and it was just so funny. And I was glad that these things were going to be a success. And then a bunch of sort of weird unconnected scenes that didn't seem to have much to do with anything happened. The girl that I was sitting with said that we would be sure to come to these things next year before we graduate because then we might not get so many opportunities to see them. I agreed with her. She was a funny person and I really didn't know her very well, and I'm not sure that I liked her too well. She reminds me of somebody I know."
"051"	"(07/14/62)"	"My husband and I were going to have this public debate about something. I can't remember exactly what it was. It seems he wanted some prisoner condemned to death, and I wanted him spared. And it didn't seem right that we should debate because my husband's been on a debating team and I didn't have any experience in it. But I thought I would do the best I could. When we actually started debating, neither of us had very much to say actually. We brought up all these people to speak for us and they were mostly people who would emotionally sway the audience one way or the other, like I had this folk singer named Joan, to sing. He had some other types of people. He was going to make the last speech and he was making it. I don't know how the thing turned out. "
"052"	"(07/14/62)"	"My mother and I were somewhere in the South, I guess, and we were going to this Negro college. We were just going to look around. We were sort of curious, I guess, about what kind of facilities they had. We came to this one building and we decided we'd like to go through it. Classes were over for the day and so the building was deserted, so we thought we'd go through it. And we went into some classroom. The only way out of it was through this bathroom. Then we went down these halls and looked around, and I think we were sort of surprised that it was a fairly nice building and it was in pretty good shape. And we could see into the cafeteria which was really nice because they had this counter with stools like, and then they had these big round tables with these leather chairs, and there was this huge rug on the floor It was much nicer than the cafeteria here, say. We walked along and came out and some people were walking, quite a few Negroes and some white people who apparently were going to school there. I'm sure this person after a while wasn't my mother any longer. I don't know who it was, but anyhow we kept on talking and walking over this big campus. We knew quite a few of the people, at least the person I was with did. I started getting unhappy because I started thinking about these people who were going to college and when they got out, they wouldn't be able to do anything and it wasn't fair. Then we met this strange group of white people that I didn't care for too much. There was something very odd about all of them. There was some boy or some man in his late twenties and he looked sort of queer and then these girls with him were very strange. They were fat and ugly and sort of loose looking maybe. I and the person I was with, who was now some boy, started talking with them and joking with them and there were a couple of white boys on the campus and acted as if what we had been doing there was something pretty wrong about it. We had just better stop it and I was just sort of laughing at this one who started following me and this boy around. Then I got separated from this boy somehow. Then this policeman started being right nasty to me, and he said I and this other girl should have this swinging contest on the swings on this playground. If I swung higher than she did, I could go back to my husband. Otherwise I would have to stay with this policeman. I didn't think he had the right to do that, but I didn't know exactly how I could get out of it."
"053"	"(07/15/62)"	"I was going to go to Europe with this friend of mine. We were going over just for the day, and I was really looking forward to it. I was thinking about all the things I was going to get when I was over there. It seems kind of funny that we could go over just for the day. We were going over on a steamer, but we were just going to be gone one day."
"054"	"(07/15/62)"	"The dream started out with this Negro maid, this old woman who had a daughter who was in the hospital because she had had an abortion. The daughter had been having this affair with this white man and she thought he was in love with her, but he had never given her any money or help when she was in the hospital or anything, and never acted particularly nice toward her. So we were trying to persuade her that he wasn't the type of person to be with and for her to try to just forget about him and find somebody else and get married. We were also looking fro this person, this man. I had seen him one time and I was going to point him out to somebody else who was with me. I never got a chance to do it. We were in this big restaurant sort of place and there was such a complicating thing. There was a postcard. It was a picture of an elephant which was covered with these strange little insects, and underneath its skin was sot of red and blue. I was telling this person, I believe it was my mother, who I was going to show this man if ever came around, that this was the kind of shirt he had on. We were sitting in this restaurant, waiting in this booth to see if this man would come down. There were a lot of people walking around us and two boys that I used to know from high school were seated across from us. As we sat there, all of a sudden there was this big something. Anyhow we all got thrown around against the table and everything and it was an earthquake. Everybody was standing up. I don't know exactly why we were all standing up to see if it would happen again or not. There was sort of this big tension. Then filing up the stairs in this slow terrible walk came this group of convicts. Apparently there was a prison in the basement, and for some reason, I guess the guards thought the prisoners would be safer upstairs, they were bringing them up. Some of them didn't look particularly different from anybody else. They didn't have a distinctive uniform, although they were dressed in sort of a strange way that set them apart. A lot of them maybe looked leathery looking. Their skin was sort of an odd consistency and they looked very strange. They went on upstairs. Then I got sort of involved with the story of these convicts and I couldn't, I don't know exactly what happened, but I was reading or somebody was telling me the fact that once a year they could give a play that had three characters in it if somebody in the place had written one. And somebody had this year. It was a terrible play. It was written in this flamboyant verse and it had three characters in it, two women and a man, but it was a horrible play. It was funny because it was in this outlandish verse and sort of old-fashioned in that respect and yet it was sort of an expressionistic play too. It was sort of an odd combination."
"055"	"(07/15/62)"	"My husband and I and somebody else were driving down this little road in the rain with a couple, with a car and a big trailer. We were going down to this river where we had been the year before in my dream, but not actually, to set up some sort of a camp there. It seems as if we were going to fish or something. It was some commercial project. We got down to the place where we had been and we could see where we had put, exactly where we had put the car and this trailer the previous year. There was water in everything, in the grass leading down to the bank of the river and water overflowing on this wooden platform. But we were going to set it up and then somehow we had set up on some place about 25 feet above the river. There were big piles set down into the edge of the bank but not into the water itself and overlaid with boards to form sort of a very tall pier. Then somehow on the end of this--not on it, but on something else--our trailer was set up in back of this--not on the pier, but on shore-- was a little house which was set on a steep bank which was sort of a cliff which went straight down to the part of the bank that this pier was set up on. And underneath this pier also and leading back up toward the little house, maybe even into it, were these cement steps which I imagine led up into its basement or something. Also now the river was right in front of us, was diverted by this cement wall, just a little part of it came in front of us and the main part was on out past it, and it had been raining so the river was rushing along. Well, I came out of the house. My husband was doing something in the trailer or right around it with a whisk broom. I was going to sweep off this dock or pier or whatever it was because it had a lot of dirt and stuff on it that had been accumulating there. So I was doing this, and there were one or two boards that were rotten. And then this other person who was with us came out with this big broom and started sweeping real hard. And I told her not to do that because this place was sort of rickety. Then the whole pier bent sideways a little bit and it came back and then the next thing that happened was that the whole thing just started collapsing like it was completely rotten, all the boards, everything, the piles that held it up, just collapsing. And this girl - now it seems as it's my sister - wasn't on it, but I started falling thru right in the middle of it and calling to them to help me. And so I went down thru the boards. I wasn't hurt at all. I just got down underneath this thing, and I climbed up on this little white car that was sitting under there, a little foreign car. It put me about, say, 15 feet below where the trailer was. I don't understand what the trailer was sitting on, where my husband was. He didn't seem to think there was very much that they could get me back up from there. He -- this is very strange -- he didn't think they could lower a rope down from right there and pull me up and I couldn't go thru the stairs at the bottom because apparently some of them had collapsed with all this pier. He suggested that I get on an air mattress and float around and paddle, swim up around the end of the river, and then he would come down to there and get me, but I didn't think that would be possible because the current was so strong and I would have to be swimming upstream. So he said that he would com down and take me up and show me how impossible it was going to be to save me. And so he did. He came down and we went back up to the house and I surveyed the scene, and it did seem sort of hard. As far as I remember, I went back down there to wait to be rescued. It was very strange."
"056"	"(07/16/62)"	"I was over in the hospital. It seems as though I was working there and I was sick in some way. So I was sort of in the Employee's Health although it was run by a bunch of people I had known in the Biology Dept. when I worked there, especially the head technician. I was supposed to go down there for a couple of shots of flu vaccine. Whatever I had, although it was some sort of physical disease, it also seemed to be mental in some way. When I went down to Employee's Health, they were all real busy when I went in there at first. So I went out and had to come back again later. Somebody had given me this little pink pill to carry with me to show to whoever I found in charge there so they would know exactly what I wanted. And when I went back there, another person who I had known in the Biology Dept., she worked in the Pathology Dept., gave me a cup of water to take in with me. And I went in with my little pill and apparently I was going to have to dissolve this pill and drink it and then have these shots. Then somebody came over and noticed me. I told them what I wanted and it seems as though I was going to get the shots in a little while."
"057"	"(07/16/62)"	"In my dream I was with my husband and this friend of his from his hometown, and we neither were in that town or anyplace around here that I know of. The friend's house was this big house on a big sloping lot with a ditch that ran all the way around the edge of it. His friend was lying in this ditch. He had just taken some psilocybin and he was lying there and waiting for some sort of fix to take place. It seemed sort of strange to us and we were talking to him for a while. Then I noticed this beautiful green car in the driveway. It was some sort of a foreign car, some sort of a sports car, and I'm not usually attracted by cars and this is sort of strange, but in this dream I thought this was the most lovely car. I walked around it and as I was walking back around it looked like a gib, colonial wing style chair, very padded and everything, and a slightly different shade of green. Then as I walked down around, it was the car again, and it didn't seem strange to me at all that this should have happened. Then we were talking to this friend some more. Then it seems we all went in the house and we went up to about the third story and there were quite a group of people there. We were preparing things for this sort of mescaline orgy we were going to have. We were going to take mescaline and we had all these little things set up that would be especially nice to see or do while you had mescaline. We had them set up in several different rooms. We were getting everything ready and suddenly it was real late at night. It was 2:45 a.m. and the house was no longer here in this residential area but in this big -- it was like a big office building -- and we were much higher than that from the ground now, about 10 stories, I'd suggest. It was very cold outside. I went to the window and looked out and could see these different people down below, mostly the teenagers and these policemen. These teenagers seemed just to be standing around jeering at the policemen, and the policemen were, all of them were just sort of livid with rage and hitting at these people standing around. So I was calling to the people to come look at this. Oh yes, I was wandering around in a pair of red lace panties and this lacy white half slip and nothing else. But anyway, maybe that's why it was so cold. I got these other people over to look and we raised the window to hear what the policeman was yelling at the crowd. He saw us watching. He was hitting one of these teenagers over the head with his night stick, and then he took another one and threw it at us. It came right into the window and hit one of the boys in the eye. Then he threw another one, but that was too low, and missed. So we all sort of got back from the window because we figured if we stayed around and watched him much longer, it would provoke him and he would come up and get us. So I was watching these people from another window. Then I sort of got involved in the scene down there with some of these people. Some of them were whole families. It wasn't New Year's Eve or anything, and I don't know why they were all standing down there. These families were all, the parents were trying to persuade this mother to go back to their children. Then these particular set of people were talking about their daughter or all of their daughters. They had about five or six who were unmarried, all of them were unmarried, and they were worrying about her. Finally they decided that if they could get just one of the daughters married, it didn't matter to whom, that all of them would settle down and they couldn't want to come roaming around the streets at night like this. So they were going to marry off one of the younger daughters to some lawyer and she didn't much like the idea, and he didn't much either. But they were going to do it since they didn't have much choice. This was a Jewish family and they were going thru all sorts of strange rituals with the bride-to-be and the husband-to-be with these little rites and ceremonies that had some special significance. Apparently, although I don't know if there are actually such ceremonies, I was watching these ceremonies when I woke up."
"058"	"(07/17/62)"	"The dream took place in some strange house and I and a few other people were there. We were speculating on this deep problem which part of an orange was the most important. Was it the seed or was it the juicy pulp, or was it something else? We came to the conclusion that the seed was the most important. From that you could grow new orange trees. Then this dream went into a second episode which had to do with something about friends. Telling your real friends from your false friends or something."
"059"	"(07/17/62)"	"The dream started with my being in Illinois with this neighbor of mine who is up there right now with her parents, and with her children. I came to see her on her parents' farm and I was real excited at the prospect. I thought it would be lots of fun. It was sort of a, well, I guess it would be a pretty countryside and a pretty house, but it was all dark outside as if a storm was coming. I went into the house with her, sort of an old-fashioned house. We went into the bedroom and there was this mule there. I wanted very much to ride it and she was going to let me. We were going to saddle it, and what we were going to use for a saddle pad were several EEG records. I don't know where she got them from. It didn't astonish me at the time. We went out into this big room that was sort of the kitchen and the dining room. Her parents were sitting there at the table. Her mother gave this impression of being a very strong-minded woman and she just seemed to look at this friend and she shrunk up and didn't do anything. The parents were sitting there eating supper and the mother only had a skirt on. She didn't have a blouse or anything on. We went past them into another bedroom leading the mule, I guess. Her mother didn't say a word to us. We gathered that she didn't want us to take that mule out and ride it, but we were talking about it. We went into the bedroom, and from there we could look out and past this hedge we could see her younger brother and sister walking along. Her sister was about 10 and her brother about 13, which isn't so in reality. The little sister hadn't seen her brother in a long time, so they were walking along talking happily. Then they came into the house. Her mother called us, or rather called my friend, but called her by my name, which isn't her name. I wondered how I was going to distinguish between her mother calling her and her mother calling me. I thought we would have to use initials or something. We went out into the kitchen and we were cooking up some pork chops for our supper. There didn't seem to be really enough for all of us. But I wasn't very hungry, so I didn't particularly care. Then her little brother sat down at the table and started eating something and he was throwing it up. Everybody seemed more annoyed at this than concerned for him. Then this changed into a series of strange episodes, which were taken from this book I was reading last night by Sternberg."
"060"	"(07/19/62)"	"Some friends of ours were coming over, friends who recently had a new little baby, and this old friend of ours named John K. who we haven seen in years, who is a physics graduate student. It seems that this John was going to baby-sit with our daughter while we went out to dinner with this other couple somewhere. But we weren't even sure that he was really coming, but finally they did get there, and he was going to baby-sit for us. I was showing him things about the baby -- how to change her diapers and various things. So he and I were talking to each other. While we were, we weren't in the apartment any more. We were in this big building that was under construction. I know it was at night, but there were workmen all over the place. They were all working at something. There were lots of little stairs going up and down and half finished boards and it was fairly dark. Exactly what we were doing there I can't remember. I remember having to go past a couple of workmen who were soldering something with some soldering guns and they had left them there. I was afraid of getting burned. This one workman made this sort of nasty remark to me as I went past. Then I told him he'd better not do that again. Something confused happened next, I don't remember."
"061"	"(07/19/62)"	"The dream was very strange and it was partly like a movie and partly like something that was really happening. There was this man and who he was, I'm not sure. But this other man, and he was a dean from a nearby university who was coming to attend this meeting, was going to kill him in this terrible way. He must be on his guard and not take anything from anybody to eat. He wouldn't know who this person was. So when the meeting was to be held, this very strange-looking person came up to the man and offered him something in this bottle. This was a little, fairly big yellow pill. The man was about to take it and eat it. I shoved the bottle from this bad man's hand and it fell onto these marble steps. This broke into several pieces and the pill started foaming on the marble as if it had been acid. The vile man was put out and told what it did. It was something horrible. It just dissolved away our whole digestive system in a few seconds. Then you die, of course. He went into this in some detail. Though he was frustrated in this attempt to kill this man, he was going to try again. So I, having seen him, knew if I could get away that maybe I could bring help somehow. So I pretended to be going along with the two people, but I broke away and ran down these stairs. I came to the chief of police's office. I knocked and then I didn't even wait. He was sitting here with this girlfriend of mine from my hometown. I told him that somebody had tried to murder somebody and he didn't. He admitted that he had murdered several other people. He just had to do something to stop him. And he didn't seem too concerned, the police chief didn't. The girl didn't seem very interested and I told her it was her own father that man had tried to kill, but that didn't seem to upset her very much either. Just about then the bad man came down there with the other man. The police chief took a gun and pointed it at him and said he was under arrest. He did come in and sit down, but he acted rather smug as if we weren't going to be able to keep him or hold him. You know, we didn't have any evidence or anything. The man he was going to kill seemed rather reluctant to say anything. I told him that I had been a witness too. Then it seems that this had been real and yet it hadn't been real and the man who had, the other man who had tried to murder was making a movie and was really terrified because when he smoked a few cigarettes, he got very cross-eyed. It reminded me about a Japanese warrior or something, but he said it wasn't. Then we were going over the story and we were talking about if you had seen enough stories like this, ordinary life would seem so very dull and everything. Then it seemed as if I was walking away from the movie set after the movie over these great number of stairs. I was walking away from this big house over these stairs that were rather hard to get up and I was somewhat worried because I thought somebody in the house was going to follow me. But I went on up finally and got away and was starting to get thru these woods which were very dense and very thick and sort of, the ground was wet and squishy and I didn't want anybody to see me. But these two sort of simple ladies who were in the movie were out walking in the woods and I knew that they were going to see me. There were, it was a strange woods because every once in a while there were electrical connections and cords around, and the ground was so wet and these wires were just lying there. And I wondered if anybody turned them on or anything, if somebody might not get shocked. I was trying to hide from these ladies behind these curtains in these woods, but they saw me and it didn't seem to make too much impression on them. Where I had hidden was at this door which led into this farmer's house. Apparently, although there was a room there, the other door was locked. I thought perhaps it had been cut off by snow because there was snow around, and I went back a little bit the way I had come and I came to another door which I could get into and this was a storeroom in this farmer's house. There was furniture and stuff piled around, and a window in front which had been covered up with some cardboard, but I uncovered it and looked out. It was very wide, flat land and it was evening, and the farmer and his family were coming home. Their front door was right next to the storeroom, and I was certain they would see me because in the first place with all the cardboard off the window, light would show thru it. They didn't seem to notice me, but anyhow I left and went back home. Home here was apparently my hometown, although the house wasn't the same as my parents' house. I went in and just talked to everybody for a while and that was it."
"062"	"(07/21/62)"	"I dreamed that I had another baby. It was a little girl too and I guess it looked a great deal like my daughter did when she was a baby. When I came home, I came home to a funny place. I don't know where it was. But an old woman who used to look after me and my brother and my sister when we were about 6, 7 and 8, had come to help me take care of my new little girl. She was about the same age as she was then, which I guess was nearly 50. I decided the new baby would sleep in this little crib we had just the way that my daughter had for quite a while. I wanted to fix it up so we would be sure she would never slip out of it. I had this idea of tacking screen sort of humped around the edge of it to sort of form a cocoon-like thing that you slip her into and you could put the blanket on the outside of it and it wouldn't bog down around her and yet she would be protected from drafts at the same time. Also she couldn't fall out of the crib. This old lady who was there didn't think that was a very good thing to do. I was wondering what to name our little girl because we hadn't much thought our second little baby would be a girl and we hadn't thought of any names. I thought of naming her Bonnie, which is my sister's name, but I didn't really know if I liked that or not. Then it seems I was going with my new little baby and my next door neighbor. I was in my university town and I was going over to campus. Exactly why I was, I don't know. I think she had to do something in the language office there since her husband is a graduate student in Spanish. I was just more or less going with her. When we got there, the professor that I had for French last semester was there. Somebody told them to look at the baby. So he was looking and I was asking what name I should give it. He didn't particularly have any ideas. He didn't look like a professor looks in real life at all. He looked more like the doctor I was working for in the Biology Dept. right before I had my daughter. At any rate, he took me out in the hall and started congratulating me on the final that I did in his class, and how good it was and how hardly anybody else had done any better. Of course, this made me feel very good because I consider this professor the best that I've ever had anyhow. I told him, which is so, that I wanted to audit one of his courses next fall. He said that would be fine. Then I went back into the office and there were on a little table, there were several samples of some rock, they called it jade. It wasn't really jade. It was some form of quartz, more like opal. This other girl was ready to go, but I was sort of attracted by this display, and I wanted to stay and look at it for a little while, but we left. I believe that was all of that dream or else it faded into this which is a very independent sort of thing in which I was at home in my hometown, that is, with this old friend of mine from grammar school and high school that I never particularly liked. We were over in the high school where I had gone to school, but it was different. It had been so long ago that I had been there or something or they were in a new building. We were in some part of the building, and we went into a little room where we were going to study for a quiz or something. This was the math building and it seems she was majoring in math. I thought that was a little strange, but we went out for something. I didn't stay in there for only a couple of minutes. I don't know what we were going to do, but we went upstairs somewhere and she said she was going back to get our books. I would have gone back with her, but I didn't feel much like running back, then coming back here and running up the stairs and everything, so I said I'd wait right there, and she said she'd be back in a few minutes. While I was waiting, I noticed this boy along the wall right in front of me, and it also went around the corner and continued on down. This was the math part of this building, but I also think there was a science part, and I think this corridor led toward the science part. I started looking at this display, which was very strange. It was made up of incidents from a science fiction story which in the dream I had read, but in actuality I don't believe I have. It was of various things. There was a picture of the solar system. There were sculptures of this and that, all sorts of things. It was sort of confusing. I was looking at it. It occurred to me that I had been watching it for some while. This girl hadn't come back, and I figured she had probably just gotten her own books and had gone. It made me sort of mad and upset me because I wasn't at all sure of my way around this building and I wasn't sure I could find my way back to the room we had been in, but I went down the stairs and started walking along, and there was this man. He was evidently an instructor or professor walking along, and he had a limp. I walked along beside him and told him I was looking for this room, but the first room which had double doors that we came to I opened and looked. Then I noticed there were booths as though it was some sort of restaurant or something. So I went on and looked in several rooms. None of them were it. Finally we came to the end of the hall and then I found a room which I opened. It didn't much look like the room we'd been in, but I thought it just had to be. But there were painters in there painting and there wasn't any sign of any books. So I asked them if they had seen any books, and put them away when they had started painting, and they said yes, they had. I asked them where they had put them. They had put them in a back corner when they had already painted under this canvas. So I said when could I get them because I need them right now, that it was very urgent. So they got them for me. When they got them for me, the scene sort of changed and there was a counter there and this woman had gotten the books. I was with some friend now, this friend Edna of ours from N.J. This woman was showing my friend these books and saying look, what fine books these are. And they were magazines. It seems as though they were copies of some we had taken or are taking. There was a copy of Science, Atlas, and some other strange magazines which weren't very impressive. I was telling her and this American Indian who had appeared somehow on the other side of her, about his article that appeared in one of these magazines about Indians. There was a very complicated game in one of these magazines. It was a game that really I didn't understand, but I had played one round of it or something with somebody. In the game there were three, it was a piece of paper, in this case it was a page in a magazine, in which there was a square formed by three figures of various types of people or in various, not exactly situations, but you could infer what type of people or what type of action they normally engaged in by the pictures, and there were three figures across and three down, so there were nine in all. The object was to get to one of these and to get there, you would mark over them or something in your choice, and you were supposed to have these figures end up in the form of a cross such that the figures in all parts of the cross represented how the one in the center had come to be the way the one in the center was. It was a very, rather confusing. It was very clear in the dream. This particular one that I had ended up with somebody who was crucified and it was an Indian. The Indian by friend's side said that I seem to understand perfectly how somebody came to end up this way because of the ones I had chosen to go along with it. I said that I was going to show him this article in this other magazine that I had which was about a certain tribe of American Indians and their ceremonies, which included a sort of ritual crucifixion, only it wasn't. It wasn't with nails or on a cross; it was on a tree. I was finding this article for her and I think that was the end of the dream."
"063"	"(07/22/62)"	"In the first part of my dream last night it was winter. I was out here in the university married student's housing where we live. It was very early in the morning and I was on my way to school, but I was going from door to door of the houses on the street behind us. When anybody would come to the door, I would tell them about my husband's dream experiments and how he was going to carry them out and how he needed people to participate in them. So I would tell them all about it and try and get them to be interested in it. I went to one house and after I spent quite a while talking to the girl there, she was gradually showing me how to leave because the neighborhood had turned into a strange neighborhood and a strange town as far as that goes. She took me out into the yard and showed me how to go down some little path to the street. It seems like she was going along with me. At any rate, I believe she did and we started walking down the street toward the center of town, which was several blocks away. It was a very bad section of town or maybe the whole town was like this. But there were all these juvenile delinquents running around and everything. This big group of boys was following us and we were right afraid, but we thought that surely, we were running, we thought that surely if we ran up to some house and knocked on the door, they would probably let us in, but we were afraid of knocking on the door or a house where nobody was home, then having these boys behind us catch up to us in the meanwhile. I don't know what happened to this girl as we got closer to town, but she sort of dropped out of the dream. There were crowds of people milling around uptown, all of them sort of rowdy, like in this group of boys clustered in around me. I think this already happened once. But at any rate, it's sort of confused. I climbed up this telephone pole to get away from them. There were some policemen around though, and they were white policemen, but they didn't pay any attention to me and nobody was paying attention to me. So I sort of resigned myself and came back down the telephone pole. There were some men standing around and I appealed to them to help me, and they did -- one in particular. So I started walking off with this man who had helped me, holding hands with him. I didn't particularly want to go walking off with him, but I thought that I was expected to reward him in some way for having rescued me. Then I was just walking down the streets of this town. These policemen either weren't doing anything or weren't very effective about it. I crossed several streets and was going out of town again and I knew where I wanted to go. Way up on the hill there was the big, very big Catholic church and monastery, and I wanted to go there and confess to one of the priests. I don't remember what my aim was or what I was expecting to accomplish by this. It seems also that a lot of businessmen had been recently going to this church, even though they weren't Catholics. As I walked along the side of the road, there were also quite a few cars going up in that direction toward the church. I heard one motorist tell another one that he made this mistake of going in from the third road when he was there, and not to do that because for some reason that lowered you in the eyes of the priests or something. The road cured around at a big right angle to the left and came back again, and so I cut across, skirting around a little stream and cut across the land in between where the road curved around and then I was up in this parking lot. So I went into the church and there was a priest there. I told him I wasn't Catholic but I wanted to confess and, of course, I don't know if this would be possible in a Catholic church or not. But at any rate he showed me how to go into one of these little confession booths and we just started talking generally mostly. I don't know what it was. I guess I wanted to do something about all the rioting and lawlessness that was going on in the town. I thought maybe nobody knew about it and if I told somebody about it, maybe something could be done. At any rate, I stayed there talking and he absolved me of my sins, but he said it didn't count because I wasn't a Catholic. It seems that I went back to him again sometime later."
"064"	"(07/22/62)"	"It seems we're up in my husband's hometown visiting his mother and there were several rather confused things and we were going to go back home to my university town the day after tomorrow. We were wondering whether we should go to Europe for the next day. I wanted to, but nobody else thought it would be a very good idea, but we were talking about how when we came back in the fall that we could get maps and where to buy groceries and everything from this aunt and uncle of my husband's, Gilda and Bernie, because they had been there the last summer or something."
"065"	"(08/01/62)"	"It was sometime in the future, and there had been an atomic war and there weren't many people left. Nothing seemed to be particularly ravaged or wrecked by the war, though there had just been one. The few people left were being exterminated by the robots that they had made to do all sorts of things for them. There were a variety of robots. I don't exactly understand why they were killing people off, but they were. I and two other people -- both men -- had apparently just learned about the whole thing, the catastrophe and everything, and we weren't sure about survivors and all. This took place in some large city on the edge of the sea. We went into a building and we found three robots who were immobilized. This often happens with robots and you turn a little switch on, then they come to life. So these being journalism robots, we figured that they would know what was going on and would be able to tell us. So we activated them and then to our very surprise, they jumped on us and tried to kill us. We didn't have any weapons particularly, but we did get away from them. Now it seemed that we knew a little bit more than we did before because we knew we seemed to have to get away from this whole city because the robots were hunting down anybody they could find and were killing them. The only people who were left were those who were hidden away in a few islands off the shore some miles, at least in this particular country, which didn't seem to be America anyhow. We found a motorboat and set out for these islands. People who were especially rich often had private homes on these little islands, most of which were just chunks of rock jutting up from under the water, but some had homes carved out under these rocks and completely hidden. We go to some of these rich people's houses as we go along looking for a place to go. It seems that perhaps we were being pursued by a couple of these robots, which in this case looked more like gorillas or something. But we had one thing in our favor, which was that they couldn't use radar for some reason. This meant they couldn't follow you for very long. I guess actually it was more like radium they couldn't use, so they couldn't get a whole bunch of them after a person at once. At any rate, we came to a little island which was just a big black rock jutting out of the water with a little edge right around it, sort of not very much of a ledge, but you could stand on another rock that sort of jutted up behind that. I t was dark rock, very dark like lava. We all got off and sort of stood with our backs against the edge. It seemed to be only a temporary stopping place. While we were standing there, two large sea turtles came in right where we were standing, where there was also a little bit of sand in among the rocks. It started laying eggs there, and this was the point for me to give some sort of zoological lecture about the survival of the fittest or something because we didn't have any food with us, so we were going to gobble up all of these eggs. I can't quite remember whether we stayed on this island or whether we went to another one. At any rate, I think we had first to fight off a couple of these robots which were following us. It seems perhaps we did go to another island after we had been there a little while and found that it really was quite pleasant as these islands went because beyond the rock and the beach that we had first been on there were quite a few trees and a little grassy meadow. The whole island couldn't have been more than four or five acres. I walked down across the meadow and across this marshy place that I had discovered. In actuality we were very close to the city we were escaping from to start with because I could see it very clearly. I could see a workman lounging in a doorway. This was a Negro worker and it wasn't a robot, and I wondered how it was that the robots let him be around in the city. Then by swimming a little in shallow water and crossing another little island and then swimming off again, you could be right at the city. I had this great urge to go over to it, so I did. Then I saw some robots coming, so I swam back and I didn't want them to realize how close our island was or that it was the one to which I was going, so I swam around it and thru this swampy marsh to think that I was going past it. As I swam, I was thinking to myself that I was swimming like a shark does, although the picture I had in my mind of it -- the shark in the dream -- wasn't very shark-lie. It was more like a dolphin. It was strange because the water I am swimming thru has all kinds of what I was calling sharks in my dream swimming along close to me. So I swam right into the part of the island where we had started and I got out. In the next part of this dream, which faded right in from the first part, I was looking at my diary and the date in my diary was something, I believe it was July 15, 1941, which is ridiculous because I was born in 1939. Anyway, the diary was propped up in a big archway leading into a big church and open to this page. I felt very strange and said to myself, ""Why, that's 15 years ago,"" which is inaccurate anyway. I thought, ""Wouldn't that be strange?"" and I went in thru this archway and was inside this church. There were several people there who had been my friends in high school. These twin boys I had known and some other people I can't remember distinctly. This date apparently had been a very special one for us. We were sort of counting back on the anniversary of it and reliving it. We had thought that it was indeed about in high school that this occurred and it was 15 years after that time because we all looked about the way we did in high school. We sort of reminisced about this thing. I went to get my diary, I believe, to show them something. It wasn't very strange, I guess, but it seemed sort of weird, demonstrating that time was turning the pages rapidly, one by one. We just reminisced for a while and then I guess I woke up."
"066"	"(08/04/62)"	"I had a dream last night that I've been thinking about all day. It's rather simple. I dreamed that I was walking near a highway. I was going on a long trip. I was going to my husband's hometown, where his parents live. I don't know that I was going to see them. I was in the road and acting as if I was driving a car although I was walking. There were trucks in front of me and cars and so forth, though the road was curving and you couldn't see very far ahead. But I did have a chance and would pass these trucks. I would just run out and go around them and then go on. Before very long I came to a place where the road was under construction. Since I was walking (I was barefoot, incidentally) I could go on this part of the road even though it was blocked off. I walked along this part of the road where there was this lane down the asphalt and everything. I came to a  point where the workmen had stopped because it was lunchtime, and they were eating their lunch. I started talking with them and started having intercourse with about 6 or 8 of them. It didn't seem such an unusual thing to me at the time and I was going to continue along the road. The reason this dream seems important is because I have had several dreams over a period of time in the past where it was night and I was barefoot and out walking somewhere along these dark streets in some strange neighborhood and I didn't know where I was going or why I was going. But it always in a strange neighborhood and I had sort of this lost feeling. I think this dream is sort of symbolic. Perhaps I have found my road in life or something like this."
"067"	"(09/07/62)"	"I dreamed that I was uptown in a town that somehow was a cross between my hometown and some small town in the mountains. I was going to go shopping in this town in a big department store, but before I did I was going to take a long walk somewhere. It was in the afternoon and I had quite a bit of time so I started walking sort of out of town in a direction I had never walked in before. The minute I got on the back streets and off the main street of this town it started looking like a great big city instead of a small little mill town or something. The roads that came in were dirt roads and I was going down all these dirt roads to another little town, then that was supposed to be not very far off, just a few miles. And I was starting to do this when I realized I wouldn't have time to walk to this town and back and besides I was really too tired to do this, so I turned around and came back onto the main street of town in a different way from the way I had come before. Across the street to the other side. Then I was walking with my husband and with my sister, who was here visiting us this weekend, and we were walking down the street and we saw this little shop and it was very easy to distinguish among the stores on the street because it had this very high and narrow tower with this little thing on the top of it, a very phallic-looking tower all painted yellow and blue and red, very gaudy and as we came up to the door of the little restaurant, or whatever it was, we saw that there were 2 display windows there, and this man was standing out, the man who owned it, was standing out under it, the doorway with some peaches in his hand and was putting the peaches on display in the window so everybody could see the type of peaches he had. They looked real good, but we decided not to go in there. This was incidentally a lesbian temple around, is what we called it. There's a place in my university's town called the Temple where these male homosexuals are supposed to congregate and this is the lesbian room. So we homosexuals are supposed to congregate and this is the lesbian room. So we walked down and we came to another little pizza shop, this was a modern little shop where the man was standing out in the doorway of his shop too and he had some pizzas on display, but they were rather unusual because all the sauce was inside. The crust was in two layers and all the sauce was on the inside and he had a variety of things he would put on these pizzas for you, but he didn't have any pizzas with all these things displayed and I told him he would probably do better business if he would start displaying this type of pizza. Then I guess we walked on and then or at some point earlier in this dream, I was by myself again and it was earlier in the day now and I was going to go into these stores, especially this one big department store, to look for maternity clothes. This because when my sister was up here, she dated somebody and they went to the Temple room"
"068"	"(09/08/62)"	"Some aliens of a strange sort were trying to take over the world. In some ways they were good and other ways they were evil. The type of thing that they were, they were sort of a great amoebae composed of smaller amoebas and they took over someone's brain, someone's whole body and could manipulate this person and they were very hard to kill. They were good in that for instance if one of them got control, say of a large city, he could manipulate it so that there wouldn't be any accidents, traffic accidents or anything, or anything bad happening. But on the other hand, what was mostly bad about them was the fact that they took away your freedom and you couldn't do anything any more, but just what they were directing you to. I realized they were evil and I wanted to get rid of this one. Apparently not too many of them had been coming so far, and I wanted to get rid of them. I think I had a pistol and it was rather involved action because only one person had been taken over by this thing, but in some way it could manipulate a whole crowd of people even though only one person was actually taken over by the thing. I think I did, attempted to get rid of one, and I almost did, but as I said, they were very hard to kill, so even though you shot and shot at them, they would still be alive and still be capable of hurting these other people, but I think finally the whole problem was solved when there was a second man. The first one had taken over was a male person and the second one was female, and I was going to shoot at this female one who was just walking along alone. When she found out there was another one there trying to manipulate, he got very jealous because she wanted to be the one who did it all, and so she was going to rush in and fight with the other alien. I figured that when this happened, whatever was left of either one of them would be easy enough to kill and I guess this is what happened."
"069"	"(09/16/62)"	"The dream concerned California. We had been talking about CA last night to somebody who lived there. The place that I was in, in CA, was exactly the way he had described it. The way I sort of pictured it in my mind. No place would actually look this way and we, my husband and I, and I believe this other person who is an instructor in psychology, were driving along and were going to some university there. When we got there, he was pointing out various places to us. I was interested in the prices of food there. I was trying to find out if they were very much different from what they are here and they weren't. When we got to this university, it seems that all the professor there were sort of in this tight little group or maybe several tight little groups who just kept all their knowledge and research to themselves and didn't tell anybody else about it, and they used code to send little cryptic messages to one another, but they didn't communicate what they were doing to anybody else and we, my husband and I, were trying to get this information. It was sort of dangerous. It was more like a spy ring than faculty members, but we were trying to get some of this information and messages away from them."
"070"	"(09/17/62)"	"I was with my husband. We were driving to this small town. It seemed to be up in the mountains and we came to a place where the road went and we had come down this street and the crossroads that we had come to was a small dirt road and you could turn to the left or to the right and we went to the left because it was a part of the road that we had never been down before and we just wanted to see where it went. We turned down the road and fairly soon after that, we had turned down it. It branched again and there was a dirt road on one side and we started going down that and there was a gate that blocked our way and it was some sort of National Forest or National Park. There were tables set up for picnics and everything, but it was closed and we were sort of indignant. We were talking to a young boy who was obviously working as a ranger just for the summer and asked him what this meant because we had been to 3 or 4 places just recently which were national parks or something and they had all been closed down, and since this was the busy season they should do their repairs at some other time. So he went off to consult with somebody and we came back and there were several people standing around besides us that also wanted to get in. Some people who were on the inside already, but still were standing there. The person that this ranger brought back was ranger also and took this hose and turned it on rather strongly and put the nozzle down against the lock of the gate and the pressure finally broke it open, so we went on in and there was an old house inside the park or whatever, and the ranger told us this was an old mountaineer's home and there was nothing historic about it. It had been left and there was some old furniture and stuff in it and anything we wanted we could buy for this nominal fee. So we went into the house along with this other family that we sort of took this instant dislike to for some reason. There was a grandmother and then the, her daughter or daughter-in-law and son or son-in-law and 2 of their children. I don't know what it was we disliked about them. I guess they were typical tourists or something and we thought we weren't. So we started rummaging around anyhow. There was this one big room. It was real dusty and there wasn't very much in it. There were some old caches that looked like they had been lying around the floor for 50 years or so and a few boxes of things and we started looking thru these and we found some things that were quite interesting. We found 3 little kerosene lanterns, the old-fashioned type, only they weren't exactly kerosene lanterns because they also had candles in them. Then we found some little knickknacks and bric-a-brac type stuff, these little salt and pepper shakers and little statues and such and we thought of taking some of those with us, but really there wasn't very much there that we wanted and besides the dust was bothering me. I have asthma and in my dream, all the dust and everything in the place was bothering me, which is sort of unusual for a dream. I don't think I've ever had a dream like that before. Anyway, we got our little collection of stuff and went out toward the door and ranger was standing behind a counter and cash register and we were going to pile the things there and let him add up the cost."
"071"	"(09/17/62)"	"I was over at campus and apparently school had just started like it will next week, and I was over on campus with my class tickets and my books and I was going from one class to another. And I came out of a building by a door I didn't usually come out of, and I was sort of confused as to which way to go, but I got straightened out and I was talking to a girl who had been in one of my classes the previous semester. I went into the next building where my class was to be held and I went upstairs in it and I walked down the length of the hall and went down the flight of stairs at the other end and out again. I was sort of confused, but I was talking to this big matronly woman who said that I needed to pay, my husband and I needed to pay, if we were going to the banquet that was to be held that night for some reason, and so I gave her some money and she put it down on this list with a lot of other people and it was apparently sort of a donation type thing. You gave over a certain amount and you gave whatever you could, and she said now we needed to get all these tables which were lying folded up on the ground, these long rectangular tables, set up in a big rectangle around. And so I guess they got set up and something else sort of confusing happened, and my husband and I and some other people were sitting not with this main group of people, but somewhere off to one side waiting for some little boy or other to bring our supper to us. While we were sitting, I was observing this very strange phenomenon in the sky and around people, these colors and so forth. Finally no one brought our supper, so I said, ""Let's go over there and get some,"" and so we walked around and most people sort of finished eating, but there were all sorts of food left. And so I was sort of abrupt in tone to the woman who was standing there, telling her someone was supposed to bring our supper and they didn't. So she said it was a very strange collection of food, I can't remember exactly what though. There was a pancake that was shaped like a doughnut, only it was flat, and there were some French fried potatoes and something else weird. My husband and I picked up some water to drink. We had our choice of tea or coffee, but we just had ice water. Then we started eating and that was the end of that dream."
"072"	"(09/19/62)"	"The dream is a little involved, but it concerned a football game here at the university. It was something like watching a cartoon and some little character had gotten involved in a football game and didn't know what was going on, as things happen in cartoons. Somehow he had gotten the ball and gotten it way up on top of a flagpole. It was in the middle of the football field. At least this is where it was at the time and it was stuck up there and it wouldn't come down if he shook the flagpole or anything and the wind wouldn't blow it off. It was just sort of stuck there and it seems in some way I had been responsible for this and everybody was mad because the game was just over now. And so I was walking sort of along this dirt road close to the auditorium afterwards and this car went past with these people in it I hadn't seen for several years, a man and his wife, and they stopped and we started talking, and I told them what had happened. And now when I was pointing to the football, it wasn't on the flagpole in the middle of the stadium anymore, but on top of a big flagpole that was on top of a big water tower similar to the one that is close to the stadium here. And so we were looking up at this football and when we watched it, it started teetering back and forth and pretty soon it fell down, all the way down from the top of the water tower which was a real long way. And I was wondering if the football would burst when it hit the ground, but it didn't and so I picked it up and threw it over to one of the attendants of the team and he took it and went away. Then I went back over to where these people were and they offered to give me a ride home and I was very reluctant to take it because I knew it would be out of their way and besides I had my daughter's stroller with me. And I had been going along this sandy road and it was pretty dirty and everything. And they had just gotten this car, although it was a pretty shoddy-looking car. The girl had picked it out and she had just gone into a used car lot and gotten one that was all dented up and everything. Anyway, they said yes they would take me home and so I was opening the trunk to put the stroller in it and there was already a tear back there and this was the man's chair and he didn't want it to get scratched or hurt in any way. I finally got everything settled in there so the trunk would close because it was a very small trunk. And when the stroller was folded up, it didn't seem to fit in there very well and I closed it up and got into the car and we didn't go very far. We drove just a little bit, sort of back around a circle or something. We were out at their place or their relatives' place in the country and we had stopped there for a little while and I didn't want to do this at all, but I was stuck there. That was about all of that dream."
"073"	"(09/19/62)"	"I had a dream about school that was sort of confused. I had gotten my class assignments and a whole several sheets of mimeographed things about various classes, and I had gone into a new building to find one of these classes. It doesn't seem like a class that I was signed up for because it was some sort of a music course, and I went into the room and found a seat. It was a pretty big lecture hall and the music instructor, this man, came in and started telling us about the various courses that were on this sheet and also asking us questions about material, real involved questions about all sort of odds and ends of material, things about the economic situation, history, music and movies, all sorts of strange questions he was asking, but most of the questions he asked people who had been in his classes previously. He asked me one. He asked me who on the other side of the room knew the answer to the question and the question that he asked me and I told him from what I thought I knew because we also had a seating chart of everybody in the room too. He didn't say whether that was right or wrong, but just made a little notation on his log sheet. It was sort of a confused dream."
"074"	"(09/20/62)"	"We were up in the mountains with my parents and I guess somebody else, my sister was up there anyhow, up in a cabin that they have. I was out walking. It was sort of a dark, cloudy day, sort of as if it were sometime late in September or October or something. I was up on this hill and looking up. Overhead there were all sorts of birds flying, a great big flock of them. It was sort of a funny thing, although I didn't think about it then. Although they kept flying and flying, they sort of stayed in the same place somehow, and I wondered what kind of birds they were. A lot of them were big birds, but I thought if they were ducks or geese or something like that, they would fly in some sort of a formation and these were just sort of bunched up in a big flock. I was watching them and all of a sudden my father came out and he shot one of them. It fell down and it was a duck, and it was a real pretty little duck, and I felt real bad about it and I started crying because the poor little duck had been killed."
"075"	"(09/20/62)"	"I had a dream about the mountains and it seems that I and my husband were up there just by ourselves. We had been up there for a weekend, but we were leaving sort of early in the morning of the day that we were going, and my husband called me to the window and said to look out, what sort of a view you could see, and this isn't the type of view that you can see in reality from the cabin. He said the dust doesn't seem to get on the roads around there so that you can look down the mountain and see them and down where the cave is, you can see that especially plainly and there is not any cave around there actually. Then the mountains sort of sloped off steeply and the road circled it around and around going down and down, close to the bottom there was a big lake and a little stream and I went outside. I was walking around and exactly how I got there isn't too clear, but I was down where the lake was and the stream behaved in a very funny fashion because it ran backwards and uphill into this lake, which was down - apparently a water supply or something. There was a road that led around by the lake and I was going to walk up that road. It's rather confusing to describe it. There was sort of a hill and there was a road on one side and on the other side another branches where the stream apparently ran and somebody was standing in that stream dressed in sort of a skin diver's outfit. And they were throwing shovels full of water back over toward the lake and this was a pretty immense distance for anybody to throw shovels full of water, but they seemed to be making it mostly. So some of the water was falling down on the road where I was going to have to walk, and it was real cold. So I asked them if they would please stop and so I had walked under that particular place on the road and they said yes. So I walked there and told the person I had gone up on the hill by this time over this lake and it was all right to go on. So then he took a firecracker and lighted it and threw it at me, but I picked it up and threw it in the lake. Then some sort of confused episode happened and now I was back up close around the cabin. This girl who apparently was one of the daughters of them and who sort of looks after all the cabins in this little community there in the winter, came up and started bothering me, telling me her brother was somewhere. Apparently they were sort of a malicious gang, but anyhow they were sort of following me or something and they were going to, oh I don't know, play some practical jokes on me or something, and I didn't care for this. I felt like telling her that it was sort of private property up there and she had no right whatsoever to be on it, but somehow this didn't seem like a very nice thing to tell her, but I didn't say anything about that. So we walked along and finally we came to a road that was right pebbly and narrow, just a dirt road like all the roads had been, and I was barefooted. My guitar was lying on the road and I was afraid one of them might pick it up and damage it in some way, and there was a fence on either side of the road beside the field and so it was a barbed wire fence. All of a sudden I grabbed this girl and started shoving her against the fence. What precipitated this was the fact that she was being called home to supper and for some reason I guess I thought that I had some sort of advantage or something. She hadn't actually done anything to me, but anyhow I grabbed her and started pushing her against this barbed wire and naturally sort of scratched her and everything, and I was being right mean to her. I finally let her go. We both started back down the same road together and I was watching her try to get back at me some way, so I was watching her and I came to the point in the road where I had left my shoes, a pair of sneakers for some reason, they were red sneakers and I sort of put them on real cautiously, watching her. And it was pretty hard to put my sneakers on with one hand standing up while I was trying not to get off balance or anything. But finally I guess I did and I picked up my guitar and started walking back toward the cabin and she went off to wherever she was going. That was the end of that dream."
"076"	"(09/20/62)"	"The dream which concerned a dental clinic here which I'm going to go to in a few days. I dreamed I went over now before the desk opened and was going to sign up for the all-diagnostic clinic when they opened the desk at 2. Several other people were there. We all signed up. The girl who put my name down was a young student nurse and she said, ""Would you like to see your...,"" oh, it was something silly like togetherness card or something, and it was about, it was a card that my student nurse who had sort of followed my case along when I was pregnant and had my daughter. It was a card she filled out and I sort of wondered at the time how this student nurse knew that I was going to be down there that particular day, and why she would write it down to show me. I had a whole armload of books. Apparently I had brought all my schoolbooks with me because I figured that I was going to be waiting there a long time. And I guess I thought I was going to do some work in them, but I walked over and put them down on a desk and some man who appeared to have something to do with the clinic was telling us that we mustn't put our feet on any of the chairs because chairs were for people to sit on. This was a man who was, oh, about 10 years older than I and some sort of indeterminate woman, and I was real thirsty and this man kept giving this lecture about the chairs and I got sort of tired listening to him and felt I was being sort of impolite. But anyway I gradually edged away from him and started walking down the hall looking for a water fountain, and I found one. I had to go out of the dental school wing of the building in my dream anyhow and now I found a water fountain and I also noticed that there was a ladies' room right there. So I got some water and went back and sat down and tried to find a few magazines that were worth reading. There was this weird collection of magazines, a few Life and ordinary magazines. I picked up a Ladies Home Journal and then a whole collection -- not exactly hymnals, but thin, slick bound magazines that were full of sort of vitalistic types of things -- and I didn't understand exactly what they were doing there and I didn't care to read any of them. I started reading this Ladies Home Journal and it had a story in there about some sort of a space launching pad or whatever you call it, only it was a very weird and mysterious place that was illustrated. Page after page of this almost complete blackness with just a little bit of color running through it and sort of a chicken wire mesh effect on the blackness. And so that was really sort of where that ended too. I was just sitting there reading and waiting to be called and also wondering about this dental student who I know, a couple that I know, but one in particular who is supposed to come down and sort of guide me thru all this stuff and be sure that I got somebody to see me."
"077"	"(09/22/62)"	"The dream concerned the woman who lives next door to us who is, I would say, is in her early or middle 50's, and we were standing around talking to someone else who lived on the other side of her, or talking about those people to someone else, and I was saying that there was something funny about both of these people -- the woman who lives right next door and then this person who lived one apartment further down. But the woman who lived right next door was the one that there was something really strange wrong with her, and that she was some sort of psychotic, even though she seemed very nice, but there was still something very strange wrong with her."
"078"	"(09/22/62)"	"In this dream I was very much afraid of this woman because I knew that she wanted to kill my daughter and me. It was a very irrational thing and unmotivated. There would be no reason for it, but she wanted to do it. Although I had been in the habit of leaving my doors unlocked and everything, I started locking them all the time, and I pictured several times in my mind very vividly her coming in and shooting us and shooting thru the walls or something, killing my daughter and me or both. And then in this dream and exactly how this happened, I'm not certain, but my daughter had to do something and was going to be there at some railroad station or something for some reason, and this woman knew it. And I was going to follow her and she was going to stab her and my husband was going to try to stop her, but there would be a very slight chance - because apparently this railroad station was in a very big city somewhere - and if he missed her once, then it would be too late. I was in this big city and the locale of this dream sort of shifted around right fluidly and I was looking out of the hotel window and I saw this woman slowly going along toward the railroad station. I wanted to call up my husband and tell him that I had seen her, and I couldn't find the number in my book. I looked up Dick Tracy, is what I was looking up. It was a different city and I couldn't get them. Anyway, I was back in my apartment in my university town, and I was frantic and I didn't know what to do and I thought, ""Well, I'll call over at the psychiatric lab where he works and I will talk to them because I know he won't be there and send the police or do something. There must be something somebody can do because of this crazy woman, without trying to kill my daughter."" So I picked up the phone and we have a party line and somebody was on it. I rattled up the receiver and asked them to please get off because this was an emergency. They just ignored me. I asked again for them to please get off because this was really an emergency and I had to use the phone for 5 minutes, and they wouldn't. Apparently whoever it was had this attitude that if they couldn't use the phone for whatever conversation they were carrying on, I couldn't use it either. Finally I said, ""Can't you spare the phone for five minutes so I can save my little daugher's life?"" but they ignored me, so I ran out of the house and I ran down thru the apartments looking for somebody who had a phone that I could use. And finally I went in the last apartment and nobody was there, so I decided I would use their phone. And there was nobody on the line here, but the phone wouldn't work right. It had a very funny dialing system which I finally got to work and called up over there and got the man who's in charge, a man -- a doctor -- who's in charge, and I told him, I said wasn't there anything they could do because there was this crazy woman who was trying to kill my daugher. He said, ""Oh, you mean the one who is trying to stab her? I know about that."" He just had this very casual attitude towards it, and I was very upset because I knew that she had killed her by this time. I knew nobody could have stopped her and I said, ""Well, can anything be done to protect people from people like this?"" He said yes. So I saw that she could be arrested now and put in jail or asylum for the rest of her life, but it wouldn't do any good to us because our daugher would already be dead."
"079"	"(09/22/62)"	"I had another dream about the woman next door. In this dream I was thinking it was as if I had dreamed two days ago and remembered those dreams and talking to some man on the phone who we were supposed to go out with somewhere tonight. I said, ""By any chance do you know this woman?"" He said, oh yes, he knew her very well, and I said, ""Well, what do you think of her?"" He said, ""Oh, she's very nice, but she seems to have some secret, but I and this other friend, Herb, have figured out what her secret is."" I was a little bit skeptical of this before he said what they figured because I know this other person, Herb, although I didn't know this person in reality. He said, ""We figured out that her secret is that she wants to spend all her life helping people and doing good for them,"" and I said, ""Well, that may be so."" We were thinking of getting her to baby-sit for us, and I believe we must have because the next episode that I remember in this dream is coming into my daughter's room and this woman had just finished stabbing her with this pocket knife. She didn't show any feeling about it, she just sort of stood there and no expression on her face whatsoever. So we figured that she wasn't strong enough. That she wasn't going to stab us. We were standing one on each side of her and I said, ""Well, now that you've done that, I guess the only thing that's left for you to do is to stab yourself."" I didn't expect her to do anything about it, but she sat down on the rocking chair beside her and stuck the knife into her chest. So then she sat there for a minute and she said, ""Well, I don't see why I should do that,"" and so she pulled it out and I thought to myself, ""Well, we better call the doctor. She's not dead. We better take her over to the Emergency Room."" I called the Emergency Room and this very stupid doctor got on the phone. He said, ""What's the problem?"" I told him about the stab wound and he said, ""Well, is there much bleeding?"" I said, ""Well, it's in the chest."" He said, ""Well, can the bleeding be controlled?"" I said no. He said a couple of other real inane things and I said, ""Well, can we bring her over?"" He said something. I guess he said yes, and I called him and asked -- which I don't ever think I would really do, I don't think -- and hung up the receiver and we started over there. And just as we were getting ready to go with just this woman, I noticed that my daughter's eyes were fluttering and I thought, ""Well, maybe they could save her too."" So we were trying to get over there, and it's only a few minutes away, but it took us the longest, longest time to get over there. And I was trying to hurry with my daughter, and I finally did get over there. There were all these med students and interns standing around, and I had my daughter in a suitcase for some reason. I opened the suitcase. There was another in it and some blankets wrapped around her. I took her out and it was obvious that she was dead, but I asked them if they couldn't please do something for her. I held her up to them and they just sort of stood there, and I knew that they would ask me, ""What's your name, and your address and everything,"" so they could go get her chart before they even started doing anything, and that was the point that I woke up from that dream. I don't understand these dreams. We had this woman over last night for tea and she really is, seems to be a very nice person. These are 3 of the worst dreams I've ever had about anybody. I don't know exactly what to make of them."
"080"	"(09/24/62)"	"My husband and I were in some very large building, something like a hotel, only I don't think it was, and we were spending the night there. In the middle of the night, for some reason, I woke up and heard this funny noise, and I was listening to it, trying to figure out what it was. And all of a sudden my husband said it wasn't something, a clock or something, which apparently he was thinking I thought it was. It was somebody counting out his reels of tape in an adjoining room, and he could hear them counting them out or something. We did hear this clicking noise. It did sound like it might be plastic tape reels. These tapes contained the data from some experiment or another that he had done and were extremely valuable and apparently this person was going to try to steal them. So my husband got up and I don't remember whether he took a pistol or not, but he went into the next room and started talking to this person. I could just hear their voices, but not exactly what they were saying. I wondered if I should go thru the other rooms and call for help. I was debating this and then my husband came back into the room with the man he had found there who was in his late 30's, say, and sort of a big man, sort of foreign-looking, although he didn't speak with any particular accent. He had a little mustache, and I don't remember exactly how it happened, but some woman came into the room and my husband had persuaded all of these people that it was about time for breakfast, and it was about 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning by this time. He wasn't trying to arrest the person who was trying to steal the tapes or anything like that. He thought it would be a good idea if we all sat down and had some breakfast, so I was trying to fix some and there wasn't anything in the refrigerator that would do for breakfast. There were a few slices of Canadian bacon, and there was a big steak that I was cooking. My husband had told me that the reason for this breakfast was to have another witness, and this being this woman, that this man had actually been here, but it was a little bit vague."
"081"	"(09/24/62)"	"I was a man about 35, I guess, and I was going to South America. I had some business in the capital city of Venezuela, and I got down there. It was quite a bit like reading a book, a description, or like seeing one of these travelogues. And I found the main road right away that led to the capital and stated driving along it, and it was very attractive scenery, I guess. It was very green and there were these high grasses on each side of the road. And there was hardly any traffic. Every once in a while you would go thru a very small village which would enact as sort of a toll as you went thru it. And also at these small villages you could buy gasoline very infrequently, so every time you found anybody with a gasoline station, you stopped at once to get some. I came to a crossroads with a stoplight and it wasn't far from the capital. There was a man selling gasoline, and he was selling it from this big tank. He was a farmer or something, and he just had this large tank full and he was going to sell me 21 gallons. And he brought his hose over, and I had some strange contraption that led to the gas tank. I can't remember exactly what it looked like now. It was sort of a hollow tube and there was sand and stuff in it because there was sand on the ground here. And so I had to get this sand out of it before we put the hose in it and filled the tank up. Then I started driving on towards the city, and as I was going there was this woman at this gas tank as well as this man, and she had sort of fallen in love with me -- the man that I was. Meanwhile, I had gotten to the capital city. The whole trip was very short and the time that it seemed to take was not more than an hour. I got to the city, which looked just about like any city, and I drove into it. And I just turned around and drove back out of it, seeing that whatever my mission was, it was accomplished. As I drove back, it seemed that when I got to this particular gas tank again, I stopped where this girl was."
"082"	"(09/26/62)"	"I was on a bus going home to my hometown. I was talking to the bus driver who was a woman and I was talking to her in French because she was French, although she understood English. I wanted to sort of practice my French on her and I was telling her, she asked me something about witches. Did I think they really existed or what? So I was telling her that I thought they did, and their different qualities about them, and they really could work magic and all this sort of stuff. I told her how last Christmas I had gone up to the park in my hometown and had met a group of witches who had invited me to their meeting or rather had been forced to since I was there. I was supposed to not reveal their secrets or something. Then this woman, although she was the bus driver, got off at a stop which was quite a distance from where I wanted to get off, but I got off anyhow because I wanted to keep on talking to her. We were talking and I asked her if my French pronunciation was good and if she could understand me, but she didn't ever exactly give me a definite answer on that. The rest of the dream was sort of vague. It seems that I was going with her where her home was along the street. It isn't really a street in my hometown in actuality, but it is a street that's been in my dreams before."
"083"	"(09/28/62)"	"I was going with my mother and my little brother, who's about 9 or 10, into this hobby shop in the shopping center here to look for some sort of present for my daughter for Xmas. What I especially wanted to look at were these wooden puzzles and we went into the hobby shop and looked around at these various things, and then we saw these wooden puzzles. They had on them the age level that would probably be able to work them. So I saw some that I thought would be too complicated for her to work, the age level on them was such that she should have been able to. So I was looking at them and thinking I would come back sometime and get them. Then as we kept walking around in there, I saw several tops for my daughter, sort of little glass tops that I decided to get. I noticed that they must not be doing too well because they were setting up sort of a children's shoe and clothing store along with their toys and educational things and hobby stuff. I was disappointed because I enjoyed going out there and I knew it wasn't going to be as much of a hobby shop as it had been."
"084"	"(09/28/62)"	"I had sort of a strange dream that was based on sort of a science fiction story that I had read last night in which I was this man that could sort of get into somebody else's mind and follow them around wherever they went. It was a real eerie sensation to be in one place and in another place at the same time. I had some connection with the police or something and was following these people for some special reason this way."
"085"	"(09/29/62)"	"My husband is taking me to a football game here at the university and he had brought his car. And I had brought my bus and we had parked in this private parking lot that was for the faculty near the stadium, which you had to have a key to turn on the parking meter or something. But we parked, then went into the stadium and found seats and sat down, and the seats were not like in an ordinary football stadium. They were seats like in a gym or something. Neither of us was particularly enjoying ourselves and football isn't a game we would particularly go to see in the first place. I don't quite understand why we had gone to this particular game. We sat there and talked for a while. The game never did start."
"086"	"(09/29/62)"	"My husband had taken this boy next door, these people who recently moved in, this Negro family, and he had taken the man -- somewhere in his 20's -- over to the lab for some sort of a routine test. I'm not sure exactly what he was trying to do, but he was going to hook up EEG, GSR leads and so forth and run some sort of experiment. The doctor who works over there, the psychologist, had been helping him hook the leads up and I was over there, whether to run the equipment or just to watch them, I'm not sure. This man began telling us of some dreams that he had had over the past few weeks, and some of them were quite involved and of a private nature, and I wondered why he was telling them to us - about being impotent and some of his family problems and such like. He was sort of sounding like a hypochondriac and seemed to have all sorts of difficulties with his stomach. He would take all these pills and everything and these laxatives, and he'd run some of his dreams on these things he'd take right before going to bed. We'd been in there for a while and while the experiment was going on and then we had to go move our cars, which were still in this parking lot of this previous dream because nobody was supposed to park there, we found out. So we went out and my husband moved his car and we went over to my bus and got in it. My husband wanted to make love there, but didn't because the bus had sort of changed and didn't have walls to it any more. It was just sort of open, and it looked like it had been sitting there for quite a while because there were some spider webs and things in it. We were getting ready to go back over to the building, over to the lab, when I noticed that on these weeds that were growing close to the front of the bus there was this tiny little animal and it looked something like a lemur and something like a mouse. And it was like no animal that I had ever seen before. It was a very strange animal and I wanted to catch it and take it over to the zoo dept. and see if they knew what it was. So I went back in and fooled around and I finally found a container that I thought would hold the thing. I was a little bit afraid of it, even though it was small, because I thought it might be vicious or something. So I went back to the bush and after quite a few tries of chasing the little animal around, I finally got it into my container. This was a small container. It was glass and for some reason, I had covered it with some cloth and it had a screw top on it. And then I took it back into the building and then it was quite a big larger. There was a light in it that made heat, but the light was separated off from where the little animal was by a magazine or something we put in there. There was this cloth all around it and the top on it. Gee, this container just got larger and larger as time went on. Anyway, I looked inside. I pulled some of the cloth back so I could see. The little animal changed is character, and it wasn't this little shrew or lemur thing any more. It was, in fact, two little animals, one of which resembled a horned toad, if you can imagine some sort of mammal that had developed little scales in place of its fur. The other animal that was in there was a strange and unusual creature because it was made out of beige yarn. It was knitted, but there was no question that it was alive. It reminds me very strongly now of two things. One is a science fiction story I read a long time ago, not recently, about this race of creatures that looked like men but weren't because their brains had been eaten away by some sort of fungus. And the other thing that this reminds me of in its appearance is the mouthless divinities that there are paintings of pre-historic Australian natives. In appearance this is what the thing looked like."
"087"	"(10/03/62)"	"I was uptown in a sort of strange town that wasn't my university town, but something like my hometown, and I was in a dime store looking for some sort of cosmetic case. I looked at all different types of compacts that were there. They held a strange variety of things. Some of them had rouge and eye shadow, and some of them had cold cream and powder and various assortments of sort of wild things, but I didn't see anything that was exactly what I was looking for. It was sort of like afternoon and it seems that I had planned to stay up here all day. What exactly I was going to do here, I don't know. I was going to buy some strange odds and ends of things like thread and stuff. At any rate, nothing that would seem to justify my staying here most of the day and even part of the night, but it was getting close to supper time, so I thought I would go over to the lunch counter in the dime store and get something for lunch -- for supper, rather. I went over to it and all the lights in the store were off. The store had never been brightly lighted and now all the lights were off and the only light was coming in from the outside. And I went back to the counter where a couple of waitresses were and somebody else was there, and asked if they were open, and she said that they were. So I ordered some sort of a strange meal as I remember, a hamburger and about 4 or 5 different types of vegetables that came with it."
"088"	"(10/03/62)"	"My husband was going to visit this friend of ours, this Mexican-American in his earlier 30's up towards the library, and I got special permission to go with him on the grounds that he was my friend too and I knew him. I had to get permission from the dean or something like this. It seemed a little strange that we should be taking him on a tour of the library because he lives here and he perfectly knows well the library. But at any rate, we were going to and I was waiting in the library for my husband and this man to come, and I was standing by the room with big double doors with little oval windows in them that the freshman library lectures were being given in about a week ago, and now it was the freshman reading room and the doors were open. It was so strange because everything in it -- the people, the walls, everything, the tables -- were various shades of gray or white, just like a black and white movie. And I would look into this room and it would look so strange that I just couldn't believe it, and I would look back out and everything else would look normal. It was just so peculiar. I've never seen anything like it and I couldn't understand why everything in there would be gray. I figured that it was some trick of the light, that the people couldn't really be that way. No, not even their faces, their whole appearance was gray. When my husband his friend came up, I told them about  it. We looked in, but now when we looked in, although everything wasn't in perfect color, it was sort of a pale sort of wash of color over the scene and it had changed. We started off walking thru the library. Then the whole dream changed. It was sort of this melodrama going on. Sometimes I was watching and sometimes I might have been either of the 3 characters that were in it. The 3 characters were this man and these 2 women who looked -- no, they didn't look exactly alike; they did except for the color of their hair, I think -- who both loved this man and the blonde-haired woman was some sort of princess or some high-born lady, and the other girl who was dark-haired was from the lower classes or something. And this noble woman was very jealous; even if she thought this man would love this other girl rather than her, she would rather have him dead than be with her. So there was this big scene. Somehow the noble woman had gotten the man arrested on some sort of charges. It must have taken place at least a couple of hundred years ago, if not in the Middle Ages, because it seems the king's men had come out to arrest him and were going to put him in this big dungeon or something, and everybody was carrying swords around. It was really a strange thing and sometimes I would be a man and sometimes I would be a woman. If I were the man, sometimes I would love one of the girls and sometimes the other. Finally, I believe, the man and the dark-haired lower class girl had gotten away somehow and were running off together. So the blonde-haired girl, the noble girl, couldn't stand this chunk of ice with some sort of magical properties it was supposed to have, and she threw it at the couple as they were embracing, whereupon the couple were both near, and near one of them was a man that she had loved and the one who had been changed from a girl was now a troll, so the dream said. This wasn't the effect this ice was supposed to have. It was supposed to just kill them, I think. The last scenes of this were exactly as if I read a comic book about it because the scenes were in these little boxes and what was going on was written down at the bottom. I would see one of these scenes sort of frozen, and then maybe it would be animated for a while. It was sort of unusual."
"089"	"(10/05/62)"	"The dream concerned these people who were, there had been an atomic war, and these people were up in this cabin in the mountains trying to sort of hide there until the fallout would be past and it would be safe to go out. There were two men and one woman, I believe, and I was the woman and they were all in their 30's. They had various provisions and such to try and keep them to this time, a week or two. The cabin was made of brick and it had many windows in it, and these people weren't doing very much to keep the radiation from getting in really. But everything outside looked so innocuous, it was hard to believe anything very bad could be happening. But they all started getting sick and one person in particular and it was sort of as if this were in a novel and this person wasn't going to get well. After some time the person who was I in the dream had to go out into the living room to go across to get some more provisions, and when I went out and looked thru these picture windows in the front of the cabin, I saw all these people walking around outside, talking in unusual accents, British or Irish or some thing and none of them seemed to be particularly bothered by anything. So I thought well, maybe it was safe. On the other hand, maybe these were some sort of different people. I went outside though and was sort of caught with this group of women and another woman was addressing them and she apparently was from a different planet or something, the one who had waged this war and was asking us what we had done. And we almost confessed what we had done or said against them and so she let us down some steps into this sort of church and we were all supposed to confess at some point or another to what we had done. And it wasn't clear how strict or how lenient these people would be with us, and I knew that I hadn't done anything. Something confusing then happened. I was talking to a boy who was in one of my classes and this woman who wanted us to confess now apparently was our instructor and we were just discussing her. She was one of these people who were really blustery and sound sort of mean, but really she wasn't. So we talked about her for a while. Then we were in class. I don't remember exactly what we were studying, and then class was over and I went down to the library and into the ladies' room because there's sort of a lounge there and I wanted to rest awhile before I went home. This boy was in there too and we were both sitting on the couch and there was somebody else in there that I knew that I was talking to, this woman who's in her middle 30's who's in school there. So we talked for a while and then I left because I had to get home. and when I went out and started walking sort of thru the parking lot, there were all these cars for students, all these male students. They seemed to be looking for girls and seemed to be some sort of orgy type thing, but nobody seemed particularly to want to interfere with it or anything. So I was walking down the street and I came to where there were these several coeds and these several students and this one male student who I came near rushed up and grabbed me and started trying to make love with me. I tried to get away from him and tell him I was married and everything, but it didn't seem to stop him too much and I really didn't want him too much to stop. So we started making love now on the ground with all these people around and it didn't seem to particularly bother me. This seemed to go on for a long time. I don't remember exactly what happened. Then there was sort of a strange scene in which I had to leave and all the coeds who had been there were symbolized sort of by these metal shapes with a sort of feminine shape to them which were lying on the ground, these hollow shapes. It seems I was somewhat responsible for them and I should do something for them, but I didn't know exactly what."
"090"	"(10/10/62)"	"I dreamed that I and my husband, I believe that's all, were driving along up in the mountains thru this great dark forest. The trees in this forest, some of them were really immense, and the sides of the mountains went sort of straight up and you could look up and there were these immense trees towering overhead and these gnarled roots holding onto the ground. We knew this was close to the Indian reservation because we some trees, first they looked like white birth, then they were tall and slender and smooth and looked like arrows, so we knew we were close to the Indian reservation. We kept driving thru this forest in various places. Then the scene sort of shifted. It had snowed. There was a little town, I don't know if it was in the mountains somewhere. There really wasn't much snow on the ground, an inch or so, yet nobody was out in it. As I walked along, I started seeing little toys that had been abandoned by kids. I decided I would take them home to my daughter. The first thing I saw was a marble, a big pretty clear marble, one of these very large and pretty ones. So I picked it up and I, all the things that I found seemed to be that sort of a nature, some sort of a balls, and they were all very attractive to me for some reason. There were small ones, round, and attracted me for some reason, so I had a collection of 5 or 6 of these and also one other object which was an egg-shaped made out of rubber like most these balls were. That was my favorite thing of all except for this clear marble, but I collected this, a little sack full. I got to the grocery store and there was hardly anybody in there except the proprietor and there was hardly any selection of food because of the fact that nobody could come in with their groceries since the snow had stopped everybody. What was there was rather expensive. Besides that I didn't understand why I was at the grocery store because there really wasn't anything that we needed. I kept trying to think of what we might need, but I couldn't succeed in thinking of what I should be getting. But I did get several things. I got half a head of lettuce, corn on the cob that was cooked that I ate as I walked around the store, and several other items. I don't remember exactly what. I also had this little bag of cigarettes which had 4 or 5 cigarettes in it and I was going to smoke these in secret every once in a while. When I got to the checkout counter and this man was totaling up my groceries, he started talking about Christ and the life of Christ and Christ's betrayer. He made a special study of this and he knew all about it. He was thinking of the descendants or was it one of his disciples who betrayed him? I can't remember which it was, but he knew what their names would be and he knew what they would look like and everything. I don't understand what the point of this was, but he kept me there for a real long time. He checked everything that I had very carefully and apparently he suspected me of having some sort of relationship with this man or to this man or being a relative of his."
"091"	"(10/11/62)"	"I was having a duel with some young teenage hood and apparently I was one myself. We both had pistols and I think a couple of kinds of pistols. One was a little 22 and the other one was something bigger - I don't know what. My pistol wouldn't work right. I knew that his would if he ever got a chance to fire it at me. He probably would kill me, but mine wouldn't work. As a matter of fact, I held it right up next to him and the bullets, I held it right up to his back and shot the whole 22, well the whole 6 shots, into his back and they only made these tiny little places and the bullet didn't go in. They just disappeared or something. Then it got very involved and complex because somebody had sent one of these pistols to the professor who teaches my Greek drama course. He was talking about it being some sort of strange Greek ritual, that there was a procession in which this should be carried. Of course, that's interesting because it would be a phallic symbol and he was talking about how the phallus is carried in, in my course. Anyway, he was talking about the procession in which this is going to be carried and I was afraid that I was going to be killed in the first place. I was afraid I was going to be arrested. I knew they were out looking for me, all these people were, so I went down off the road down the bank, this steep hill that was covered with quite a few trees. It wasn't real heavily wooded and there were stones sort of arranged like steps and down sort of forming a sign of the Z on the side of the hill. There was a shelter over the central part of it. A wooden shelter and I was going down under that and all these people were running around looking for me, but they didn't would have done anything like this, so they didn't stop me."
"092"	"(10/11/62)"	"I dreamed about this older couple who live next door to my parents in my hometown. They're in their late 50's or early 60's, I guess, and I dream about them, but it wasn't at their house in my hometown that they were and I had gone over there to visit them for some reason and we wind up in the back yard where there were a lot of unusual trees, all evergreens. There were very big pines and some other types of evergreens which they weren't telling me the names of and apparently quarreling about the different names of them, and they were trees that I never heard of before. I hadn't ever seen anything exactly like them. It was as if they didn't have any type of needle and everything. From here it seems that the scene sort of shifted so that I was on a picnic somewhere. I was sitting out in this not very attractive place, this big open space sort of on top of a little hill and way down the road to one side was a lake and I was with my husband and a couple of other people and we were just sitting there. Apparently we had finished our picnic, but we just hadn't packed up our things and gotten ready to go yet, although there really wasn't anything on the picnic table that looked like food. There wasn't anything on it at all that I can remember and we were being bothered by these yellow jackets and flies and things that were coming up to the table and we had a fly swatter and we were swatting them. My husband had to urinate and he went down by the lake and there was really no place along the lake that there was any shelter so he swam across the thing over on to this little island and then came back which struck me as being awfully silly because he was sopping wet and had all this stuff on him from this lake when he came back."
"093"	"(10/11/62)"	"I was in this little car which we used to have -- a Fiat -- and it stopped in front of this little house somewhere. It was a small, plain little house which belonged to some of my husband's young relatives, or perhaps they had something to do with the boy who was with us, I believe , a boy who was in his late 20's or early 30's, I would guess, a blind student that I read for. They might have had some connection with him, but at any rate I and Al, I believe, went up to the house and went in and it was sort of a confusing house. It was small on the inside too and there were kids running around. The young woman who lived there was sort of running around after the kids and I was telling her or Al -- if it was still Al, he had turned into some girl -- that I was going to see these movies that were on. At least I would like to see these few movies that were on about based on Thomas Wolfe's novels, Look Homeward Angel and Time and the River and one of his others, I guess. Each of these was a 2-hour movie and they showed them one after the other, and we discussed the merits of doing this for a while. Of course, the last time I read Thomas Wolfe I thought he was awfully adolescent and an adolescent writer and he had a huge opinion of himself and this person agreed with me, but I thought I still might like to go see the movies."
"094"	"(10/12/62)"	"I was talking to my instructor in French romanticism, an instructor that I admire very much -- a man in his early 50's, I guess -- and we were discussing the significance of certain names in Proust's work and how all these names had a sort of hidden meaning, a symbolic meaning explaining the character, which, in fact, I don't think is actually so. But anyhow, we were talking about it and I was very happy to be talking to him about it because I think he's a very intelligent man and a very learned one. Then I don't know where we had been talking about this, but then we were in our apartment and I was in the bathroom on the toilet and he was standing beside me. And we were still talking about something and I was a little bit embarrassed by this, but not terribly so, and when I had finished we started embracing and I found this very exciting. And then it wasn't this instructor any more, but my husband, and I still found it exciting and for some reason, we couldn't go on and make love right then. It was in the afternoon and it was a strange afternoon. It was very beautiful weather. The sky was blue and there were some clouds in it, but there was something very strange and eerie about the weather. I've never seen or known any weather exactly like this and I can't explain what quality of the, it was so different, but I think it was the quality of the light. It seemed as if the light were being filtered down thru something and sort of diffused around instead of simply being there. I was going outside. I had an English bicycle and it had been overhauled or something and there were several big pieces as if the bike had things like this on it that weren't put back on it so it couldn't be ridden. So I was taking it over across the street and parking it where it would be out of the way and then I walked uptown, or at least I was uptown walking and I was walking down the street and looking into various shop windows. It was my university town, but there were stores that aren't actually in that town, and I saw my instructor again ahead of me going into this little restaurant and beer shop. And I went on past and was going on and I had been thinking about this for some time, that my daughter needs some more books to read. So I was going to go down to this dime store and buy her some and I went into this store and started looking around at the books. They had some very strange children's books, now that I think of it. They had some of these cheap books on this sort of newsprint-like paper without colored illustrations in it. I didn't want that kind for her. I wanted something that would be sturdy and they had little books on flowers of America and birds and so forth, and something very strange. It was a picture of a woman, a very slender woman and slender-waisted with her arms up over her head, and she had sort of rings on growing out of her arms like a bat, and they were sort of reddish yellow. The whole background was the yellow and I forget the title of it. It was a strange book. It was a book for older children. But I was looking, then I noticed they had all sorts of things for hobbies. And about this time my sister had come into the store and we were looking and I found something very useful to me, some set of enamel paints for copper enameling and there were about 15 or 20 different colors. And I thought this would be very nice for her. It was inexpensive, but some of the little jars looked like they had dried up, and so I was trying to look for a nicer one."
"095"	"(10/12/62)"	"I and my husband weren't really married. I was sort of his sister because I had been adopted by his mother, but we apparently lived in the same apartment we live in now, only his mother lived there too in some way. And we had our daughter and everything was just like it is except one day he came in and announced that he was going to marry this girl the next weekend, that we had never heard of or hardly ever heard of because even though he wasn't married to me and there was something apparently almost a little bit incestuous about our relationship, he didn't date very much and if he had dated this girl at all, it had only been about four or five times. And it seemed sort of strange to me and then I guess it finally hit me what was happening. The night before the wedding we were sleeping in the same bed together as usual, and I started to persuade him that he shouldn't do this, that I loved him even though I wasn't married to him. I still loved him and we had our daughter and I was maybe going to have another baby. So I was trying to persuade him not to marry this girl. It didn't seem to make much impression on him. He didn't seem to have any particular feeling about it at all or even being sorry or anything. It was very strange and I was very unhappy in the dream. I woke from it still unhappy."
"096"	"(10/18/62)"	"There was someone who was trying to kill my daughter and this someone varied in age, I think, even in the dream, but they were always rather young. And it was a rather young girl and her age would vary anywhere from 2-1/2 up into her teens, and she was completely evil like the little girl in the Bad Seed. Not only was she evil, but she had some supernormal powers. She could predict things and make things happen which ordinary people couldn't do. At the beginning of the dream there had just been a terrific rainstorm in the place where we lived, which wasn't exactly here. As a matter of fact, it seemed to be in the mountains, although it didn't remotely resemble the cabin there that we have just been to. The rain had driven in under the door and it was on the floor, and I was trying to persuade my husband to hold our daughter on the bed and not to let her away from him because as long as we were with her, this thing couldn't happen. He thought I was sort of hysterical or nonsensical or something; I didn't know what I was saying and what I was saying wasn't very important, but I finally more or less had him persuaded and I went out and there was water on the floor in the bedroom and there was water on the floor in the kitchen. I was going to clean the kitchen up a little bit. Then some sequence happened and I was outside down below the house, and was going up to it, and there were quite a few people around it - all girls as I remember, and in their teens somewhere mostly. And they were around the house and some were going up towards it. There was a big screened porch and it seemed that this was sort of a community house or something. And so I was going up the stone steps toward the house and got on the porch there and then I believe that the little girl who was trying to kill my daughter for some reason was there and she was doing something ugly, and she was a rather little child now, 3 or 4 years old. And so I told her I didn't want her there. She hadn't particularly done anything wrong. I told her I didn't want her there and I started hitting her over the head with a coat hanger, and she started crying and screaming and the nurse that took care of her came outside on the screened porch. We were on the inside somewhere and she was telling the little girl that if she wasn't happy there, they would take her home. And so I picked up the little girl and was going to take her out to her nurse and tell her to never bring her back here again or let her come back here again, and the little girl bit the back of my hand. So I thought I could fix that easy enough, so I bit at her hand and I bit one of her fingers off, and it was so easy to do like biting thru wax or something. And I knew nobody's finger came off that easy and she didn't even seem to notice that I had done it. It didn't seem to bother her at all, and I just sort of spit her finger out or something on the floor and took the little girl out to her nurse. And by this time she was screaming like she had been very cruelly mistreated, and I guess she had since I had bitten he finger off. But it seemed to me that I was completely in the right and her mother had come up behind the nurse and they were both standing there, and I sort of tried to hide the fact that one of the little girl's fingers was gone because it wasn't bleeding or anything. But then I felt sort of embarrassed because I thought what if they got home and found out she didn't have any finger and that I had bitten it off and that was pretty bad. So I had better act like I'm sorry, even though I'm not. And so I told the nurse and mother how sorry I was that I had done this, and I went back and I found her finger and I handed it to her, to the mother, and told her if they could get her over to the emergency room quick enough that they probably would be able to sew it back on."
"097"	"(10/18/62)"	"The dream seemed to take place in the same locale as 096 and out on the porch of this house there was some apparatus set up for an unusual game, a game of skill, it was supposed to be. I don't understand now how it could really work, but there was a sort of rectangular box, say about 2 feet long and a foot wide, and in the center of this you place this little flat circular thing to which one end and shading into it very nicely and geometrically was this triangle pointer so that overall the thing was sort of cone-shaped. And on the bottom of this there was sort of a circular part with sort of a pointed piece of metal that stuck down, and I guess several other something had to be there to balance the thing. And you place this in the center pointing to one corner of the box. And then in the opposite corner you were supposed to do something in some manner with your own hands without actually touching the disk thing which would make it go up to and get to this other corner and have the pointed end of the triangle touch the corner. And it was a very delicately balanced thing. As a matter of fact, now that I remember, there was a little pointer underneath the pointed end of the triangle too and the whole thing was so sensitively mounted that any little thing would jar it. And as a matter of fact, it was picking up all these seismic waves, supposedly earthquakes all around, and there were so many earthquakes, however it seemed sort of strange there would be so many because this thing was constantly moving. And the method, I can't understand the method by which you were supposed to get this thing moving, going in the right direction, because really you weren't supposed to touch any part of the thing with your hands because it was some sort of parapsychological phenomenon. But it was supposed to have something to do with magnetism and that's really all I remember of this very complicated game."
"098"	"(10/18/62)"	"I took a nap in the afternoon and while I was asleep, I had a dream. It was sort of interesting. My mother was here and we had gone to the store with my daughter. It was in the daytime and she had bought all sorts of sweets, cinnamon buns and cakes and stuff, things I don't ordinarily buy from the grocery. And I guess I thought to myself she probably bought them because we didn't ordinarily have them or something for some sort of a treat for us while she was here. But now that I think about it, none of the things she bought appealed to me very much or that I liked very much, and I believe we were with my sister, who's 18, and we were going to a movie. We were taking my daughter and we were all going to a movie. And we were out in the lobby of this movie. Maybe it wasn't going to start for a little while or something and there were a lot of little children out there my daughter's age, and some were older than she was. They were all running around playing and she was playing with them. And we kept losing sight of her and once we lost sight of her and I couldn't find her. Finally I opened this door and she was going down this long flight of dark stairs as fast as she could. At the bottom of this flight of stairs it was a narrow corridor. There were walls up to the ceiling on both sides of these narrow stairs that went down. There were whole stacks of magazines, like somebody had been storing them there. And it looked as though the stairs took another turn and probably kept on going down. I told her no that I had to spank her pretty hard because I didn't want her to ever do anything like that again, and my mother was sort of upset with the fact that I had spanked her for this, and she couldn't seem to understand why it was necessary. Then my husband came into the dream somehow and the movie bit was forgotten and I had to teach him to read. Something had happened to him or he had never, never known how and apparently he couldn't even read, he couldn't even say simple sentences, he couldn't repeat them. He could say them by himself, but he couldn't repeat them after somebody and that's one reason he couldn't read because he couldn't repeat what he saw before him, and so I took him out and sat down with him on this little couch and had an apple and I was making up these nonsensical sentences like, ""Now my husband takes a bite of the apple"" and I'd given him a bit of it and he would try to say it and he just had the most difficult time with it. He couldn't, and it was a very agonizing experience because I tried teaching this and he couldn't do this very simple thing,"" and I don't know what had happened to him in the dream, but what was supposed to have happened to him, but it wasn't his mind, his intellect, there was something some psychological block of some sort, some traumatic experience that he had had or something and now he couldn't read and I tried. I fed him some apple and these little nonsense sentences and tried to get him to repeat them and didn't have too much success with it."
"099"	"(10/19/62)"	"My husband, my daughter, and I were going on a trip somewhere, and I was with my daughter alone in some strange part of the country, perhaps somewhere in the mountains, on this little dirt road and it was late in the afternoon, getting close to night and my husband wasn't there yet. He had the car, and he was supposed to be there. So I left my daughter beside this road. There were a few houses on it, and there was a big sort of swampy place off to one side, and started walking off down the road toward the highway which was at some distance and I kept meeting cars and people along the way. Finally got down to the highway and it was practically night by this time and saw him in a car which wasn't ours. Apparently we had just bought this new car and it was big and sort of goldy brown and sort of ostentatious and there he was sitting beside the car. I asked him why he hadn't called us. Why he hadn't come. He said because he was very sick with something. I got mad about it because every time we got some place he gets sick and I said, ""Come on, let's go back to our daughter because I just left her beside the road there."" He got real upset at this and I got upset because I thought what in the world did I just leave her there for and I said we'll go. I'll take you to the hospital because he had some kind of spots all over his face, like some sort of contagious disease and so we hurried back down the road calling our daughter, getting more and more upset all the time. Finally I saw something beside the road and I told my husband to stop and I got out and it was our daughter and she had been run over and she was dead. I started calling. There were houses all around. They had their porch lights on and I started calling for somebody to help us, and there was nobody around. It was a real terrible dream, and I couldn't understand why I would have gone away and just left my daughter there, but I had."
"100"	"(10/19/62)"	"My husband, my daughter, and I were taking a trip to the state where my husband's family is and we were all packed and everything. We drove up there. Then it seems it was the next day and I was in bed. We were supposed to still be in my husband's hometown and I had a little baby, another one. I had no idea in the world that I had had it. It was very strange and I figured they must have given me something really powerful, anesthesia or something, to make me completely not remember anything about it. I don't even know whether it was a little boy or girl, and it turned out that it was a little girl, which was sort of disappointing. And there was something strange about the whole thing. I hadn't been that pregnant or something and it shouldn't have happened. I shouldn't have had the baby, but at any rate there it was. It was as big as my daughter (now 18 months old). I was showing her the baby, and she was very happy with it, seemingly. My mother-in-law seemed happy with it. I think all of these dreams reflect the fact that I'm pregnant and also worried that I might have a miscarriage."
"101"	"(10/19/62)"	"I was in the Negro section of a large town, perhaps my hometown. And I was married apparently to this black man and we were going in several stores and everything and I felt very out of place and I was meeting all of his friends and everything. I felt very out of place because I figured that nobody was ever really going to accept me here. Then in the same dream there came this strange person who was Death, and he was a young person. He was coming to carry me away and somebody else who I bet I knew. We were trying to get out of it and I had all sorts of good valid excuses why Death shouldn't carry me away right then. For instance, I had two babies to take care of and all sorts of things. Nobody else could do this as well as me. So he listened to me. And his emblem and his signal that he was going to come and take you away and what he carried with him, his badge of office, was the top of a Coke bottle and this is what he carried with him always. And if you had one of these, you were immune from death for a while. I had a long talk with Death and I asked him how he got to be this way. His mother was named Life. It was all very allegorical and everything, but how intriguing, and all these scientists who think they have analyzed everything and figured everything out don't realize that this is the way, actually the way things go on, that there really is this person named Death and there really is this person named Life. But at any rate, I didn't much want to go away with Death cause he didn't seem to treat the people he took away with him too nicely. He had them all handcuffed and tied up and I don't know what he did with them, but I didn't particularly want to go. So although it was very strange, I was sort of attracted to him as a person. I was very interested in him. It was a strange sort of attraction. It was, I don't know, sort of a physical one. But at any rate, I didn't want to go with him, so I persuaded him that I couldn't go now. I wanted to get him to give me a little one of these Coke bottle necks so that I wouldn't have to go as long as I, as long as I was going to make a bargain with him. As long as I had that and it wasn't broken, then I could stay here. But if I broke it, then I would have to go that day. That was the bargain I was going to make with him. We did quite a bit of talking and I was talking with some other people. Got a little bit complex, but I knew I was going to get away. Although then something strange happened. It seemed that he tricked me in some way because I was supposed to make a model of the Coke bottle, and I was supposed to make it from hard sugar candy, and I knew it would look very hard, but it wouldn't be and that it would melt really easily and then I would be caught, but I was in the grocery store shopping for it anyway."
"102"	"(10/20/62)"	"I went down to the house of a neighbor of mine. Not too far from here. Some people who recently moved there, Sally and Donald, whom I knew several years ago and lost touch with until they moved out here. I didn't know exactly why I had gone down there because I didn't intent to stay at all. She tells me that they had been selling some of their furniture, and they had one little thing they couldn't sell at all and they were just going to give it away, but they hated to do it, one tiny little chest of drawers. So I said, ""Well, I would like to see it because we could always use extra storage space."" So she took me back in her room and showed it to me, and it was very small. It was shaped in sort of a triangular-shaped front to it with two doors that opened up, both of these being sort of triangular shaped too, of course. It was a very beautiful little thing. it was just about, oh a foot or a foot and half high and a couple of feet wide. It was carved, this design was carved on the side, it was very beautiful wood, and one the inside it was like one of these roll-top desks. It had all these tiny little drawers and pigeon holes and things in it. I was fascinated by it and I thought, well, I couldn't just take it for nothing, even though she offered it to me and obviously she didn't really want to give it away. She suggested that if I wanted to, that I might pay her $2 and I thought that was remarkably reasonable, so I wanted to my husband to come down and carry it back for me. Just about this time he appeared and so I told him to give Sally $2. He, of course, didn't know why and I was sort of going to surprise him with this beautiful thing. And he did and he was sort of puzzled and I took him back to show him this beautiful cabinet. And she started taking all of her things out of it. My husband took the cabinet home and I was stuck there and I was sort of stranded because I didn't feel it would be polite to go right away and yet I needed to go back. This girl's mother is from some middle Eastern country, and when she was taking, Sally was taking the things out of this cabinet, she took out all of these stamps. They were Israeli stamps, and she apparently carried on quite a lively correspondence with some of her relatives there. And she had made some quite interesting sketches of various things I guess that she intended to send to them. And some of her letters were there too, and she just sort of gone somewhere and left me standing in front of all these things and I thought, well, it wouldn't be too impolite to just sort of glance at them, especially the sketches were so lovely. She had a very strange thing in there. She wrote to one of these relatives not to be too sad that her mother had shot somebody or something which I gathered was one of Sally's parents' favorite horses because, oh, I don't know, her mother had shot the horse and it made her father very unhappy. But Sally was writing her relatives not to be too distressed about this. Finally I did leave, I think, and the scene shifted. At first it seemed to be on a river bank and later it turned out to be the ocean. My husband and I and maybe some friends of ours were going to have a picnic. We were going to cook out there, and I was frying a chicken over this fire, this fire we had built, and there was a group of school children, high school children, who were also having some sort of an outing there. And I for some reason went up to a little store which was high up on the hill. I was going to get some glasses or something. When I got in there everybody was talking about how the ocean was rising, how a storm was coming. And I looked out and all around the store the ocean was. It was possible to walk back down to where I had been, but the ocean apparently came in from this direction of the hill that I had just walked up. It came in on top of that, in that direction. The waves were going down towards the little bank which was almost cut into an island where my husband and our daughter and all these other people were. The waves were going down towards the little bank which was almost cut into an island where my husband and our daughter and all these other people were. The waves were doing something very strange, which waves in actuality never do. The only way I can describe it is to say that the waves had been drawn and animated by this person who does some very wacky cartoons from Mad Magazine. They gave the appearance of sneaking along very quickly toward the shore. Well, I thought I had better go down and warn everybody very quickly cause they were dangerous and I could see the waves breaking right around us, this place where they were fixing food. Nobody seemed to be aware of them. Now let me try to describe something. There was this sort of, there was this long hill down which the waves were coming. Then there was a sort of a little upslope, and a small type of hill and on this the people were. On the other side of this, there was either just a down bank or some grass or there was little river there. And then I was going down a straight line down the hill and up the slope and so forth. There was a small river guarded by a rail and some rock and it was like a little canyon and a very high cliff immediately on the other side of this little river, and down close to the river, to the edge, sort of dark openings like sort of a cave that went back under the cliff a little ways. Well, I was going back as quickly as I could to warn everybody when this huge wave came down and crashed and swept all these people away across and down into this little river, down around these caves. So I ran down as quickly as I could and leaned over the rail that was there and saw my husband and told him to hurry and get out of there. He got out and then we looked and someone had our daughter, and we got her. And there were other waves coming and so we were trying to hurry away from them. And this now becomes a very weird thing because it was a very nightmarish quality and I apparently woke up from it. When I woke up, I was in this very strange state. I had been reading this book about astral projections and different techniques for accomplishing this, and one of them was when you woke up from a dream and were in this trance-like state, you could project your astral body. I thought, well, I'll just try it and so I concentrated on whatever I was trying to concentrate on and sure enough, my astral body or whatever and I started sitting up and this sort of upset me, and I was sort of scared. And just about this time my husband, lying next to me, muttered something and put his arm over me, over the top of me, and this sort of broke the trance and I was awake and I started telling him my horrible dream and how I was projecting. He thought that was very fine. Then I actually woke up, and that's a very strange thing to me because I never had a dream that I thought I woke up from and wasn't actually awake."
"103"	"(10/20/62)"	"I was at my old high school and there was an assembly being held out between the two buildings and all of the home rooms were drawn up together and they were all in alphabetical order. So I ran to find my place and it was a place I would have had with my married name, not the one that I would have had before. Everybody was just lined up in rows. Then this airplane came over very low, a very big airplane, and started giving us directions to do various things and I forget what the first thing they wanted us to do was and the second thing was to all come together in a tight little circular mass and everybody had to be in this. And we all did and then something happened. I don't know what it was. Maybe the airplane blew up or something strange happened and lots and lots of people got hurt. This was all sort of like a, it wasn't quite real. It was like something you would read about or perhaps imagine happening. Then everybody was lying around on the ground and everything. There may have been a lot of people hurt, but not many people looked hurt. All these different magazines were lying around--Life and Time and New Yorker and everything. And Time Magazine was very concerned with this whole thing because somehow it was their fault or something. And a representative from Time Magazine was going around looking for his Time Magazine and asking us if we still liked Time Magazine and if we would still read Time Magazine, very stupid things like this. All the teachers were very concerned. They were afraid there was going to be some kind of a scandal connected with it. The parents weren't going to be very happy about all this which, of course, was probably quite true. So there was just all this discussion going on about it."
"104"	"(10/23/62)"	"I had just come out of class and I was standing behind the library waiting for my husband to pick me up. It was sort of a miserable day, it was cold, and I didn't have enough on and so I was cold. So I saw these two people who were graduate students who were coming along and I didn't know them. Two boys and they were talking about languages, so I figured they must be in one of the language departments, and they got into this big white car and I got in with them. But I didn't say anything to them, and they didn't say anything to me, and they didn't seem to be particularly astonished that I was there. They started off and went out of the parking lot and up to the stoplight where they stopped and just sat there and talked. Finally I saw my husband coming along, but he was walking down the middle of the road. He didn't have his car with him. So I got out of these people's car and went over and asked him where the car was and it had had some sort of very strange trouble. I forget what it was. It was something sort of devastating that happened to it and I got real mad because I said every single car that we ever had is broken down within six months and we aren't able to use it. He said that wasn't so, but it was. We were walking toward the hospital. My daughter had this checkup appointment in the pediatrics clinic that day. I was going to take her, and I said, ""Well, I'll do that, but I can't walk home with her and my books too. Will you take my books?"" And my husband said yes, he would. We got in the hospital and somehow I left my books on the first floor of the hospital somewhere. My husband had gone off to get something. And I just left my books there and our daughter who hadn't been with us all the time was suddenly with us. So I got in the elevator and pushed the second floor button because this is where the clinic was. I got in and asked somebody where this clinic was because I hadn't been to this particular place before. So she started guiding me toward it and I saw the place where all these little children were waiting with the desk and I started going over to it and the girl I was with started practically pulling me away. ""No, not that place. The other one."" And that place was where the Negro children were waiting. I got sort of indignant because they were being so silly about it. It didn't make that much difference to me, and she looked at me sort of funny like maybe our daughterwas half Negro and so we got over to the appointment desk, the white appointments desk, and I was going to give her my appointment slip, and I had left my pocket book downstairs and my appointment slip in it. So I said would I get waited on any faster if I left my daughter here with you while I go down and look for my pocket book. So I left her there behind the appointment desk and started to go to look for my pocket book. Then things got real confused and I never did go back downstairs, and I was worried about my books too. I wondered if my husband would be able to find them and take them home. I came to this place, part of the hospital, part of the kitchen, dietetics where the hospital and people who needed to for some special patients they were taking care of at homes, and they had this machine or this device at any rate, that would make square hamburger patties like you can buy in a grocery store. Everybody was praising this machine. So I was supposed to go see how it worked and it wasn't anything particularly special. You just put the hamburger in between these two sort of wire grills and pressed down on it and there was your patty. It was quite a bit nicer and firmer than you would be able to ordinarily fix, but it wasn't anything that special, although in the dream it was sort of fascinating and I stood there and worked it for quite a while. Then it occurred to me that I thought that I had left my pocket book right behind the appointment desk, which of course is real contradictory since it couldn't have been so or else I would have had my appointment slip there. I think I was going back to find it when I woke up. Two things else that happened in this dream that I forgot. In the first, before I was waiting for my husband behind the library in the parking lot, I was in supposedly my French class, but we were discussing all the Irish and English playwrights and being passed out books of their work. We could read these or read some other if we wanted to, but I was given these real slender books and some of the plays I had read before, so I thought I would just keep these even if they might not be of interest. Then after I had told the lady at the appointment desk that I had left my pocket book downstairs, I thought instead of just letting me go down there and look for it where I knew I had left it, called up some desk down there and asked if this certain pocket book had been found. She started describing it to the lady and I had to tell her what the contents were. After I had done all this, then the lady downstairs said no, they hadn't found any such pocket book. It was sort of silly."
"105"	"(10/25/62)"	"My husband and I and our daughter were going with these friends of ours, Harry and Betty, who were several years older than us, out to this place where second-hand furniture was sold. We had seen this place before and been very impressed with it. So we wanted to show our friends this place. They were looking for something or other, perhaps not really interested in anything in particular, but just wanted to see what sort of things this place had, what sort of prices they wanted for them. So we went in this place which there actually is a second-hand place which has all these characteristics, but this wasn't exactly that place because instead of being in town, it was out in the country in a two-story farmhouse. To get into this farmhouse you had to go up these fairly high flight of stairs as if you were going up to the second story. You didn't go in right at the ground level. Well, we went in and looked around and our friends were very impressed by the things that we saw. For instance, we saw some very huge old copper cauldrons, about as big around anyhow as an ordinary bathtub is long, and rather ornately decorated. We were speculating on the use of ovens, and we were very intrigued, Betty and I, by the possibility of baking bread in these things. It seems sort of strange, but we were. Then we saw, it wasn't really beautiful, it was sort of unusual, old, heavy dining table and chairs, which had already been sold to somebody for $400, which seemed like rather a lot of money. But many of these things were sort of valuable antiques. There was a woman who ran this place, not in the actual store. There was a man, and she was tall and sort of thin and there was something sort of sinister about her, an old farm woman, and she had this very evil look on her face. We went down in the basement for something, to see what was down there and somebody came up to us, a man I believe, just a farmhand, but anyhow nobody particularly special, and warned us that Betty and I especially shouldn't be here because -- he said this twice -- in her speculation there was virulence. And he said this again and then he left us, and Betty and I were sort of scared. And I was especially scared because it occurred to me then that I had this other friend of mine saying something about this woman that she felt very sick at her stomach when she had been out here and had left. So I told Betty, ""Now don't eat anything that she offers,"" and then I left. It was just about noon. Then the woman came out. We were going out the back basement door, and the woman called down to us and I knew she was going to offer to give us something to eat because I could smell her cooking. I knew I was going to turn it down and I was thinking of all sorts of excuses. She came up to me and stood there talking to me for a while and she had this sort of little enamel bowl in her hand that had something in it. I was trying to get away from her as fast as I could and get into our truck. We had brought a used truck for some reason, not just a pick-up truck, but a high truck. Then I think she asked me if I would have dinner with her, and I said no, and she said, ""Oh, but it's a pity. You must do it sometime. It would make you so mean."" She sort of leered at me. Then I climbed into the truck with my daughter and I tried to close the door and she appeared and said, ""I hope your daughter likes what I have given her to eat."" So I was horrified naturally. I noticed she was chewing on something, chewing on little bits of apple or something, sort of fruit or fruit peel. So I tried to get it out because I thought it was loaded with arsenic or something. So I was sort of upset and when my husband and the other two came out in the car, I said we were going to have to hurry to get to the hospital and have this stuff analyzed and everything."
"106"	"(10/25/62)"	"My husband and I were up in the mountains, and we were going to walk to this little town. We didn't know exactly how far it was. It was about 3 to 7 miles away. My husband's mother was in the mountains with us, but we were taking my daughter with us on the walk. The road that we were to take was the same one that I walked down in a dream some time ago, not very long ago, but it didn't start at the same place it was supposed to. In this dream I remembered having walked down it before. But I thought I would walk down it with my sister. So my husband and I started out down the road and I pointed out several places to him that I remembered as I walked along. It was a dirt road and winding and it had recently been widened. Sometimes we let our daughter walk and sometimes we carried her. We came to a place where several new houses were being built on either side of the road, very far from any town or anything these houses were being built. It was a Sunday afternoon and yet these people, the people who owned them or the people who were working on them, were out working on the houses. Now that I think about it, even though these things were going on, it was very, very quiet. There was no sound and all these people were just working and not paying any attention to us as we walked by. But we came to this place where these people were building apparently something right in the middle of the road. There was a high heap of gravel in the road, and this man and woman were standing on top of it, raking it, the mound, and smoothing it. Then down in front of it there was a very flat place that had sort of been cleared out, a rectangular form that probably extended under this mound of gravel itself. I was standing in this rectangular space looking at what they were doing or just sort of standing there wondering what the purpose would be. The heap of gravel was up almost to the top of my head, I guess. And finally the woman noticed me standing there and she came up very indignantly and asked me what I was doing there, standing on their fine whatever they were building. I told her I was sorry and I moved, but I thought the mounds were what they were building and not this other place. So my husband and I with my daughter walked around and these people were hosing this mound down. My daughter saw it and started wanting a drink of water. Then the workman at one of the other houses said we had better not give her any because the purity of the water around here was uncertain. So we got on back down the road, and there was some water from the houses going down the street. It was almost sort of a paved street. It was very wide going through a residential area. It seemed to be a regular sort of suburban area, although the streets were quite wider than you would expect. There were no cars around, no people except for a few children. It was a hot day and I sort of thought it would be fun to walk along in the water, and I thought my daughter would enjoy it. So at this point we were barefoot walking through it. We walked on through this part and we came to a big crossroad where a little dirt road came into a big and complex intersection. This was way out in the country, though. It wasn't in town because we left this built-up part behind us. I told my husband that this was as far as I had come with my sister. We tried to find a sign post to find out how far it was to the little town that we were going to, and we couldn't, but we figured it must be at least another three and a half or four miles, and we had already walked that far with my daughter. I decided that we just couldn't go on because it would be that long back again. So we decided to stop. This happened to be the Blue Ridge Parkway that we had come to. Being Sunday afternoon, there were quite a few people in this little wayside park beside the highway and there was also a refreshment stand open. So we went over and found a little table, which very conveniently had a small seat, a swing type thing for our daughter to sit in, and got some things to eat. Then my husband was going to walk back, get the car and come back and get us. So my daughter and I were going to stay in this little park till he came back. So I wondered what we were going to do all that time. All of a sudden I acquired all sorts of paraphernalia, equipment like binoculars, camera and a flashlight, and mydaughter was naturally tired and there wasn't very much to do in this little place. There was a strange interlude. There was a little rustic cabin set in this park and it was inhabited by a member of the Old West. Exactly who it was, I don't believe it was Billy the Kid, it might have been Wild Bill Hitchcock, sort of a venerable-looking person with this wife and a dog. And he -- it was very complex -- but he, I believe, had been bribed by this younger man or he was the younger man who had bribed the former acknowledged all western star, into letting him be known as this, by giving him a fine old dog that the man really loved. I believe this was the one who had given the bribe rather than received it. Now his wife was doing something fraudulent. She was, she had this old Indian recipe for bleach, and it was sort of ridiculous. She packaged it up in two parts; one was this sort of whitish powder and the other was a bottle of Clorox. You were supposed to pour these two together and then you would have bleach, sort of expensive. Obviously it was a fraud because it was the Clorox, not the powder, that had the bleaching qualities. So I talked to her for a while, or at least sort of tried to, and the wife was very sort of self-righteous about this. After all, it was the only way they could earn a living. I said to this man -- I think he was Wild Bill Hitchcock -- ""All these kids out there in the park would be glad to see you. Why don't you go out there and talk to them,"" and so forth and maybe, I didn't say this, but I implied that maybe the parents would give him some money so that they would have some more to live on. He said no, that nobody was interested in him anymore. More and more strange things appeared in this place all the time. Now right in front of his cabin there was a tent with an elephant in it. It just sort of took on a carnival appearance. There was also a duel in this, which I saw or it was rehearsed, but it actually happened. I was even one of the men in it. Between the man, the old star, and the young one who was now this old man, they had quarreled about something. So the old star said, ""Let's just shoot it out,"" and the younger man, who I became in the dream, and the old man, the young man stayed in the house and the old man went out. We were both supposed to start firing at each other until we had used up all the shots in our six guns or until one of us had killed the other. So we both started shooting and neither one of us seemed to be any good. I don't understand how we could have been heroes and stars of the Old West because neither one of us did anything. I was scared to death. We were supposed to stay in this one fixed spot that we were standing in, and I kept wanting to sort of duck and get out of it. I kept counting the shots to see when all 12 of them were shot so I would know we were both safe. Finally they all got done. We were very happy that neither one of us had killed or hurt the other one. I had nicked the other man on the back of his hand, but it wasn't anything. That was the end of that little episode. As far as I can remember, it was the end of the dream except that I kept remembering all through it how long it took my husband to go back and get the car. What a long time I was having being stuck in this little park, but that's all."
"107"	"(10/27/62)"	"My husband and I and our friends Harry and Betty were up in the mountains at my parent's cabin and we had been on a walk somewhere and we were coming back. And as we started back, it started to rain. There was a big thunderstorm and we were running along, and at first we thought we had umbrellas or we had something. We either had umbrellas or some sort of pointed stakes that we were holding up in front of us as we ran, as if they were umbrellas. We were trying to hide under the trees. And as a matter of fact, I think that Harry kept breaking off the tops of trees like pine trees or something and carried them along over us. The lightning was flashing all around and it kept striking very close to me, and finally they said, ""It looks as if they are really trying to get you. God has decided your time has come,"" or something. So a little while after this, as we were running, I was running on these great huge mounds trying to land in places where lightning wouldn't hit and so forth. I heard a deep voice from out of the sky that called to me. Exact words, I'm not sure what they were, but it was God and he had chosen me to die for him. Of course, there's not very much you can do about something like that. The next I knew, I was sort of being wafted thru the air, floating thru this sort of endless space, not exactly space but this strange dimensionless place, and landed right near the cabin where I was being nailed to this cross. At first I remember it was this ordinary type of cross. It was sort of one of these X crosses. But at any rate, there I was, and I wasn't very happy about the situation at all. I didn't want to be a martyr and I wasn't the type who would have ever elected to be. It was sort of in the middle of the night and everybody else was asleep, so I was trying to be quiet, not disturb anybody. In the morning my husband came out to see me. We talked for a while and I told him how I didn't want to do this. I wasn't afraid of dying or anything. I sort of wanted to get it over with since I was doing this. Just get it over with cause it wasn't exactly pleasant. So we were talking and he was touching my legs and arms. I told him not to cause it hurt so much. Then I woke up. He really was sort of touching my legs and arms. My feet for some reason were real sore. I think it was because I was jumping around the day before, but anyway they were really sore and I was in sort of a position as if I had been crucified with my arms sort of spread out, but it was sort of an unusual dream."
"108"	"(10/27/62)"	"It was a long narrative type of dream which concerned the liberation of some prisoners from one of the Nazi concentration camps immediately after the war. And it concerns something I read about one camp when they knew that the allies were coming to liberate the prisoners. They tried to set fire to them all and just get rid of them as quick as they could. There were scenes of this, not exactly the prisoners being set afire. It was interesting because the person starting off telling this man thought that this was an example, a perfect example of what human nature was really like. Hurry to get all these people slaughtered, sort of like they were bad sports about it or something. He thought it was funny and was laughing about it. I believe that in my dream I thought, ""Well, I'm the one dreaming this and since I have caused this character to say this, I must feel this way, and why do I feel this way?"" But then the dream went on how these prisoners were lined up on both sides of the river. Apparently they were going to set fire to them or something. Then they were going to throw them all in the river, which seemed sort of silly because then that would put the fire out. The allies were coming and there were two German soldiers and a policeman there. The policeman was sort of trying to help the allies, and the German soldiers were trying to get everything done. I was, took the part of the policeman, I got shot in the back by one of these German soldiers. So I, in the dream, knew that I was dead. I was sort of lying on my knees with my face down, and sort of swaying. So the German soldier said I must not really be dead, so he shot at me again, and it hurt for a second when he shot me, and then it didn't hurt any more, either of these. These 3 dogs came over and started licking at my face. If I'm dead, why should this bother me, but it did. But I thought, ""I can't move to get rid of these dogs. Then he'll think I'm not dead."" Then there were many confusing things. The allies came and took all the prisoners away in truckloads and helped them to hospitals and such. This place, this big hall that had been the Germans' quarters, was going to be made over for something for the Americans. We were discussing whether to retile the floor or not and how to retile it if we did."
"109"	"(10/30/62)"	"My husband and I were in this subway station waiting for a train. I don't know what town it was because the locale varied considerably. Sometimes it was Boston, sometimes it was San Francisco, and sometimes it was my husband's hometown. We were in this very small waiting room sort of set up like a doctor's office that had been put down in a dark corridor that wasn't particularly well lighted. There were other people there waiting. The station manager or somebody kept telling us that when the train came that we all had to back up against the wall and be careful because these corridors were really too narrow. It was really a disgrace and the city was supposed to do something about it, but they hadn't. But if we didn't back up to the wall, just as close as we could get, we would be hit by the train. We couldn't stand in front of where the train would stop because we wouldn't be able to get past the engine which would be bigger than the rest of the train, if we did. I didn't understand how all these chairs and things could be sitting here in this waiting room because they would be right on the tracks but they were there. Finally, the train came and we all lined up against the wall and got on. I gave the man two dimes cause I thought it would be about 15 cents, but he said that wasn't enough. It was a quarter and that seemed like a lot of money to me, but he said that it really wasn't. So I and my husband took seats on the very front of the train outside of the engine compartment. Most of the time it was just me sitting there, and there was no place really to put my feet. There were ordinary train type or bus type seats there, but there was no place to put my feet because if I put them down there were sort of emergency brakes and so I had to sort of prop them on the cow catcher. I didn't like to do that very much because if we stopped, my feet might get hit against something, but we went on and we went in and out of tunnels for a while and then we were just on city streets. We didn't go back in any tunnels. I finally stopped and asked him if I could get back in the train itself because I didn't like being down on the front like that. So I came in and sat down and my husband was sitting down toward the front, and I sat down behind this boy that I really don't know at all, but he's in my French class. We were driving thru the city, thru all this complex traffic and all, and then we were sort of out of the city, very industrial sort of suburb in the outskirts of the city, and I was interested in it, all this stuff. Apparently it was a place that I had never been before, and I was just looking around to see the types of things that I could see. It was winter. The leaves were off the trees, and there were lots of pigeons roosting in the trees. In one place there were some. they looked like ducklings, but they were awfully large when I think about it. Maybe they were young geese or something because they were about the size of an adult duck, but they had this down on them. I and this boy and a couple of girls across the aisle were real interested in them. We were talking about them for a while. Then this boy started talking about somebody who raised bats in a cave around there in a little cave in his back yard. I was interested in this because we used to have a bat for a pet and so we started talking about this for a while, and he came back and sat beside me. We kept on talking and started talking about something very complex. He told me how he likes to take pictures of stage sets when a play was being presented and while the play was going on and analyze it in all these various ways. And I didn't quite understand what he was talking about, but I told him how we discussed different authors' use of space in my other French course and how we said how important it was in a novel or any work, like the old Gothic novels with their long corridors with these doors on either side and passages and all. we just kept going and going. We seemed to be on this thing for an awfully long time. We never stopped. At one point we were going thru this built-up commercialized suburb with these little restaurants and hotels and cleaners and so forth on either side. I looked over and there was something that looked like one of these big dragon places, dragon restaurant. And there was an airplane about 15 or 20 feet off the ground. A very strange looking airplane and it seemed to be obviously in trouble. It was just sort of flopping around and not seeming to be able to get anywhere. It was very quiet and for some reason even though we were driving past this, I could see it for a long time and finally the plane just sort of turned over on the ground. All this very quietly without any noise at all. I was very concerned about it, but nobody else seemed to be particularly concerned. Then we got out into more of a residential area, started stopping here and there. It was almost time for us to get off. ""Us"" was now me and this girlfriend, I believe a girlfriend named Janet whom I used to know a long time ago and who I went to high school with. We had one suitcase, so we got off, and we were going to go to wherever it was we were going. We started off this gravel path and up this hill and my girlfriend seemed to be sort of worried that it  was getting sort of late and we were sort of in this lonely place. She seemed to be a little worried for fear we would meet somebody or something. Then we went up this hill and we came over the crest of it and several boys came going in another direction. There was a little house at the top of the hill with a garden of some sort. Then we were definitely in my husband's hometown. This was some sort of a winter garden with very hardy crops. So we went thru it carefully and I was in this big field and I was barefooted, so I didn't much like to go thru this thing and I wanted my shoes, but they were in the suitcase and we couldn't stop to get them. We were going across the field and now it was my husband again, and we came to this back door of this house, and this apparently was his mother's house, but it didn't look anything like in the dream what her house looks like really. So we went in the back of the house and she came out the front after a while and she had my daughter and wanted to know where her pajamas were because our little girl was tired. That was about the end of the dream. There were several other things about it. One was during this long ride, I kept thinking was it really worth it because apparently we were going to have to take this trip every day. We were commuting from somewhere. It was about an hour there and an hour back on this little old train, and it didn't seem worth it to me. I didn't understand why we would be doing this exactly, but we were."
"110"	"(10/31/62)"	"I dreamed about Russian missiles being dropped on the U.S. It seemed to start off with my thinking what would happen if this should occur, and then with it occurring. And I wasn't in this apartment. I was in some strange house that I have never been in as far as I know, in a twin bed and my brother was in the one next to me, my older brother. My parents and my daughter were in the house somewhere. These tremendous crashes and windows being blown in, things falling over and all this sort of stuff were happening and I made myself sort of a little place behind the bed which I propped against the wall and something else. My brother didn't seem to be conscious, so I dragged him in there and waiting till all the noise and confusion had stopped. Then it so happened that this room we were in was the kitchen or very close to the kitchen. So I was getting this stuff together, all the food I could think of, doing all sorts of things, turning off the water flowing into the water heater, so water in there could be used to drink and all this sort of stuff. Some people from the Civil Defense came by and told us what to do like putting things over the window as much as we could. There were all these shouts and things going on outside. I wondered why my parents hadn't come in to see about us and I figured something must have happened to them and I went into their room, and they were just sort of both asleep. So they got up and I told them to come in with us because this was where we were going to stay for the next couple weeks till there wasn't any more fallout. So they got out and my daughter came walking out of her bedroom. We got all this stuff together, all this food and everything, and then it was this immensely long time day after day. The dream covered days and days of waiting there. We gradually brought in all sorts of nice little things to make this kitchen place more comfortable. We got our transistor radio and listened to that every once in a while to see when it would be safe and everything. It went on for an awfully long time. It was the type of thing that for some reason is immensely comforting for me and I don't know what the reason for it is. I never had a dream like it before as far as I know, but I think about this type of thing every once in a while, and it's very comforting. But I don't know what the reason is, but it seems to be so warm and secure holed up in this place with all this food and everything around us."
"111"	"(10/31/62)"	"We were in Germany and it was Christmas time and yet there had recently been this bombing and supposedly there was all this fallout in the air. People were nevertheless out doing their Christmas shopping, and I was out wandering around and seeing other packages with packages and listening to people talk in German and various other languages. It was Xmas eve, I believe. Several churches were holding these services. In this one church in particular the minister was a Lutheran minister in my hometown that I used to go to with a girlfriend of mine. He was very insistent that I stay and listen to his Xmas service, and I didn't want to at all. I didn't want to stay, so I kept trying to get away from him and I felt a little embarrassed about trying so hard to get out of a church, but I was trying so hard. I kept running into him all the time I was trying to get away. I would be there again, but finally I did manage to, I think,"
"112"	"(10/31/62)"	"I and a whole group of people were down at the beach somewhere. Nowhere that I had ever been fore in actuality, and something had occurred before this. But the fist thing that I remember, this girl and I had been taken by this boy way down the beach from where the rest of the party was. Well, it was an awfully large rowboat, and for some reason we couldn't get back the same way. He just got up and left us, though we wanted to get back to where the rest of the party was. So we left the boat the edge of the water. It wasn't really like the edge of the ocean because it was very calm with just a little bit of waves. Just right off the edge it was about a foot deep. It didn't slip off that rapidly from that point. So we were running through the water and we seemed to do this very quickly, skimming along and pulling this boat behind us in the water. When I think back on this, it seems impossible that we were able to do this because there were these jetties about a hundred feet or so that came right up right out of the water. But in the dream they didn't cause us any difficulty whatsoever. We just skimmed right on thru them or something. We finally got back after just a few minutes to where the other people were and some other people were. My mother and my daughter, my husband, somebody else's little child, my brother's girlfriend, Ann, who is about 18, and I don't know. There were more people yet, but those are the ones I can remember. We were standing there and for a while it was late in the evening. It was fairly dark. We were looking out over the ocean to this big, huge, I might as well say, resort, hotel that was sort of on this little island, or it turned out later to be on sort of a peninsula because we could walk up to it, which was really an immense hotel. It was round on it going out around each floor. It was similar in its general appearance to my brother's dorm. We were over there last night. It's a big, very large dorm with four wings. But at any rate, we were all looking out toward this place and watching this airplane which seemed to be flying low, and we could see the lights on its wings blinking. That meant that it seemed to be a fairly big airplane and it was heading out towards this hotel. As it got closer, it seemed to be on this collision course with it. It seemed to be heading right for it. It was dark. We couldn't tell whether our sense of perspective was off, but finally we saw it going at sort of an angle into the hotel. Apparently flying right thru one of the porches, and then on again, because we couldn't see its lights for a minute, then we could see them again. Then it was light again around us and I happened to look up and overhead was this airplane, one of these small Piper cub type airplanes, that seemed to be out of control or something wrong with it. Its motor wasn't working and my mother and my daughter were right there playing on the sand and several other people were right around this area that were our friends and acquaintances. Now this plane was right over us and started to circle sort of erratically. We knew it was going to fall, but we didn't know where it was going to fall, so there wasn't any point in running anywhere because you might run right into where it was going to fall. So then all of a sudden it fell almost straight down and landed almost very silently, right side up and the pilot was in it and didn't seem to be particular hurt, just sort of flopped down into the sand there. I said to grab up the children and run because it might explode or catch fire or something. So we ran back a little ways finally. I had to convince people that this was a good thing to do. What happened after that, I'm not sure, but then we -- which was my husband and I and my brother's girl Ann and my daughter -- were going to see this big hotel, walk around the circular porches, terraces around the hotel and look at the view. It wasn't something I wanted to do very much and especially when se got close to it because when we got up to the top floor, the very top terrace, it didn't have any rail around it at all. It was up very high and didn't have any rail except this very low one, about six inches or so, and that wouldn't be any help, and I wasn't going to have my daughter on it. And I didn't want anybody else to go out on it either. So I got off finally. There was some complication about my getting off the stairs because I hadn't gotten on them the wrong way or something, but I did get off and was going to the story below that which did have a more adequate rail. I believe everybody else finally came that way too, I think. When I got to the door and was ready to push it open, I noticed that stuck in the door was a $20 bill. I didn't know exactly what to do with it, but there wasn't any sense in leaving it there for somebody else to take, so I took it. We started walking around this rail and I wasn't enjoying it very much. It got down to the ground level in one place and I don't understand how this worked. Maybe it was inclined at one point and sloped down and went down to the ground, but anyhow we were walking on the sidewalk past the hotel and then got back on it again and were starting back up."
"113"	"(11/01/62)"	"I and several other people -- I don't believe I knew any of these people in particular, but they were all about my age ---were being chased by this group of other people, some of them older people, some of them around my age. One of them that I knew, this boy named Scott in my French class. Why we were being chased I'm not exactly certain. We were being chased thru this huge classroom, class building on campus, not an actual one, but just one in my dreams. It involved this running thru classrooms and in and out of classrooms and up and down these stairs, being pursued and not knowing when you saw someone coming toward you if this was one of your pursuers or one of your friends. But finally I got caught by some of the people. I guess some of the other people who were with me got caught too. We were all real exhausted from this big chase and so we were sort of lounging around trying to catch our breath and everything."
"114"	"(11/01/62)"	"I was in this dime store looking around and perhaps buy something, but at any rate I was looking around. I was looking at pocketbooks and seeing if they had any I liked. I did see one that I liked fairly well, but I didn't have my pocket book with me. So there was this big woman, utterly, utterly different from me in every way, who also thought this was a lovely pocketbook. I thought this was sort of a collegiate pocketbook. It was leather and madras or something, but she thought it was the perfect pocketbook for her to go to church with and such like things. I think, as a matter of fact, that this pocketbook sort of changed its nature. It was more of a patent leather thing. But at any rate, I was afraid she would get it and I was trying to see if it had any serial number or anything on it so maybe they could get another one for me if I wanted it. I was just wandering around the dime store and looking at some potted plants. By this time my husband came in from somewhere. We were going to buy some and I don't know why because this is something we would never buy, but we couldn't pay the price that they were asking for these plants and I forget even what kind they were. Probably in my dream I really didn't know either. Now that I think of it, the leaves of one of these plants looked like chrysanthemum leaves. The other plant looked more like this philodendron. So I went carefully, more or less carefully, not to damage the plants, and also to find some good leaves, picked off 3 leaves, 2 of the chrysanthemum type and one of the philodendron, and took them to the store manager and he was going to root them for us. And if it worked, we were going to pay a certain amount, and if it didn't work, then we didn't have to pay anything for them."
"115"	"(11/01/62)"	"I'm telling my husband about what I thought was a right foolproof scheme if you were going to make some corn liquor, some moonshine, and you didn't want to be caught. I figured out a way to do it. It does sound pretty good, even now. What you would do is get a house with a big basement and a big hot furnace, maybe one of these coal-burning types, and you'd fix your still somehow so it would be right close to this furnace. You could fix something coming out from the furnace that would supply heat to your still so that you could distill your liquor. The whole thing was supposed to be mounted on wheels so if anybody did come snooping around, you could just, quick, shove the whole thing off into a closet somewhere so they wouldn't find it. We were talking about distilling wine, making wine, and we were wondering if you would distill it in any way and sort of reading a recipe or being read a recipe by somebody, and at the same time seeing this operation being carried on. The scene sort of took place in front of this large white farmhouse, somewhere out in the country. Finally we were there and this wine bit sort of faded into the background. These people were just moving into this house, this older couple and sort of a foreign couple. I guess they were in their middle 30's or something. They seemed to be somebody we knew, but I don't know who they could have been, really nobody that I can place. So we were going thru the house. I think they were showing us the house or something, and it was fairly nice, large rooms and attractive. In the kitchen, the kitchen was in two parts and in one part the woman put up a lot of dishes she wasn't going to use and wrapped each one of them in this white shelf paper, which seemed like an awful lot of work, but she had done this, and had shelf paper on the shelves under them too. The next episode in this dream was very vaguely similar to one of the things that would occur in gothic novels because it was concerned with a much oppressed heroine who -- oh, there was somebody sinister. It all took place in this farmhouse which was about as unsinister as it could be, but there was something sinister. I was trying to find the appropriate moment or something to see what was going on and so I had this book I had read in real life in my hand, which had indexed all these events. So I was going thru the index trying to find it, but I couldn't find it."
"116"	"(11/02/62)"	"My husband had died and this is sort of a strange thing. I can't remember a lot of the details clearly because he never was, I don't know how he died, and he never acted really very dead because he talked to me and we made plans and everything as to what I should do and what, you know, everything about money arrangements and so forth. So after we had been talking for a little while I wondered whether he really was dead, why he couldn't be alive again because naturally I wasn't very thrilled with the idea of not having him around any more. So I asked him. I couldn't really be convinced that he was really dead. I thought it would be nice if I could take his place somehow because he had a lot to do that he had never been able to do and lots of things were important that he could do. I didn't have anything particularly important, but he didn't think that was possible either. He had been in this state all day that he was dead, so I decided it was time I called my mother and told her so she could come up and comfort me. Although I thought it was going to be awfully funny if she comes up here and she sees him still walking around, she's not going to think he's dead. So I tried to call her, but nobody answered at our house and I was wondering about calling my husband's mother, but I never did. I think the dream ended with us sort of sitting around discussing it and I was getting more upset with the idea of his going to be gone and not be there anymore, and also less convinced that he was dead all the time because he didn't act very much like a dead person would."
"117"	"(11/03/62)"	"I was over at a nearby university in the dorm where I used to live with my daughter. I was talking to my former roommate and to this other girl, Mary, and I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, and then we went down and got into my roommate's care to go somewhere. She had to go somewhere and we were going along with her, Mary, my daughter and I. So we had gotten to wherever it was she was going and she had gotten out of the car. Then Mary, my daughter, and I got out to sort of walk around in this little park until my roommate came back. So we walked around and I was sort of showing my daughter what she could do and everything. There were some swings and a see-saw there. So we decided to see-saw my daughter and we did that for a little while. I was telling Mary all the different words my daughter knew."
"118"	"(11/03/62)"	"The dream started off, I believe, with my looking at a picture of the most other worldly landscape, although it was supposed to have been taken in Africa somewhere. It was in color and the ocean was on the left sort of stretched out diagonally across the picture and it was covered by very thin, very low-lying clouds, sort of a mist, so up to about 10 feet or so on this ocean side the clouds were there so that you could just see glimpses of dark blue water between them. Now there was a collection of fantastic animals, all sorts of strange animals, standing along the shore and there was a little child about 5 years old or so, a little white child and naked, I believe, lying down on the sand on his back and feeding a little bird or an animal or something pieces of bread. This picture was supposedly taken in this very wild area of Africa somewhere. Then instead of this being a photograph, this seemed to be a movie which showed this tribe, this wild African tribe, trying to shoot this wild pig, and they had a great big bow which they had put up in a tree to hold it firm while they drew it and tiny little arrows, then when they shot it, it would go wild just as often as not, instead of hitting the animal. At this point I got into this somehow, I and somebody else, and we were going to show these people how to shoot their bow so they could have more meat and not have such a hard time. So we got a bow and were shooting at these pigs. There were lots of wild pigs around, and then this one pig tried to run off thru the brush and there was a marsh right there, and also the marsh ran right into a river bank or a lake bank, so it just went out into deep water. And so the pig got trapped into some sort of rope noose so it couldn't get away. This was just as good because we weren't really such good shots with the bow and arrow anyway, I and whoever this other person was. So we shot at it and finally I hit it and it rolled over on its back, and so I hit him several times in the belly, but none of my arrows, no matter how hard I pulled them, the bow string would not go in very far and it really didn't look very wounded even though these arrows were in it because there wasn't any blood. But finally, I guess, the natives came over and got it. In the rest of this dream I was sort of a spinsterish person, a little old lady, a school teacher type in about my late 40's or so, early 50's maybe, and I was addressing this whole group of ladies sitting around, celebrating and having their evening meal with all these fantastic foods, really a fantastic array of foods, all of them very happy children of nature type, and I spent in this dream, it must have been an hour or so, in this impassioned speech in which I told them that many of them had been up to this white man's land and they had seen the wondrous sights there and they had found the dazzling things which were there, and under the influence of fire, water and various other things they had been tempted to remain in the white man's land among all these marvels. But they knew they were far happier here in nature where they belonged and with some of the white man's goods, but certainly not with the white man's way of life because that was only trouble and sorrow for them. I told them then that the white man was happy with his way of life and he wouldn't trade all his paraphernalia and his way of rushing life for the calm way that these natives lived among the beauties of nature. Then I told them I was one of these unhappy people that didn't fit in either place, that I didn't like the white man's ways and yet I couldn't live in their simple and peaceful existence. And the only reason I was there was become someone whom I had dearly loved, the only one I had ever dearly loved in the white man's land, had betrayed me or something. So I had come to seek peace and solace with them and to rest for a while. Of course, this injected sort of a bit of gloom into their happy festivities so that when I quit speaking there was a silence for a while and everybody just sat and didn't know what to say to that outburst. And I was not this spinster lady any more, but someone else, the most understanding native of the tribe or something, so that when this babble of voices started back up in the babble two women's voices could be distinguished above all others and completely uncaring about the speech that went before. One was talking about her washing machine and some trouble that she had had with it and the other was telling about how in her instruction book it said to be sure it was sitting level and then water wouldn't stand in it. So I and the lady sort of looked at each other and exchanged a knowing laugh, realizing that this way of life was not our way of life but there was nothing we could do to change it or something."
"119"	"(11/06/62)"	"The dream started off in sort of an ancient Greek stage, probably because I was reading some Greek drama last night. It seemed that when someone died that there was this huge massive tunnel under the, where apparently the spirit went and certain people who had been Christian? in life could follow them a certain way thru this maze and, for instance, it was very much made a point of that the nurse could follow it a short way and if this had been a man in white, the white could follow it the furthest of all. And for this purpose one had keys, small little keys with a certain number on them and these numbers could be from one to ten and they corresponded to the numbers of the tunnels and labyrinths in the maze. The nurse would get one key and the wife would get three. Now apparently in this dream my husband had died, although I wasn't exactly myself, so my husband wouldn't be exactly the man I'm married to. But I got three keys and the nurse got a key which was numbered 7 and I got one with numbers 3, 7, and 10. So I went out, first I went down, these were wooden and were ruins in the start of this tunnel bit. I went down thru the nurse's door, which was an ordinary door, and I looked around there for a few minutes. It was old and dusty and it was closed up. It was like an attic or something. I went back up and there was a little door on the side of the wall here which was, I had a key for, but it was a small door and I had to get down on my hands and knees to get thru and I didn't much like it. It gave me sort of claustrophobia, but I did. I was very much worried about losing the keys in the cracks in the floor, and I thought if I drop these keys, there were very small, very thin, if they slip thru the cracks, then I won't have any way to get back because you're supposed to lock the doors behind you when you went thru them. So I held on to them very tightly. I was in another room, this shut-up looking room, which was like the one I had been in before in the nurse's part of the tunnel, and there was another small door leading out of it on the other side, so I decided to go out of it and I did. Then this is a little vague in my mind, but I think I was wandering around in a tunnel or a level or whatever it was, and this maze was completely fantastic. It's beyond words to describe the thing because tunnels and tunnels and tunnels intersected each other and it might be any from one thru ten. I guess in actual practice most of them seemed to be numbered with the keys I had and there was marked with the numbers right into each of these, and you could just wander forever. You would never get to the end of these things and it first seemed they were all closed in tunnels, and then I decided to stop traveling. So I took the opportunity to get out onto this 7 and then I was outside on this ramp and all these ramps were painted gray with different levels. There were stairs going up and down, usually very short ones. Even though they were steps, they didn't look like ordinary flights of stairs, but anyway I was outside and I was sort of glad to be outside. It was fairly pretty. All of these were off the ground. There were none of them that were right on the ground, but there were no rails on either side of the thing. It gave the appearance of being close to the ground because there were trees and things or bushes and vines and things around it. As I went along this ramp or whatever you want to call it, I came to a place where there was a room and there was a big picture window in it, and I could see somebody sitting inside it. I passed thru other places, but they had all been empty. They were all furnished. They weren't this attic type room that I had first been in, but they were empty. But this one had somebody sitting in it and it was this Negro man about 40 or so studying, and he has a sort of evil look about him. I went around and I pounded at the door. When he opened the door, I asked him something. I think I asked him if he knew where somebody was or if  he had seen them or something, but he hadn't, so I went on and I was still outside and it got more and more lovely. It was sort of an Alice in Wonderland type of scene. What I mean by this is a Walt Disney Alice in Wonderland with all these flowers growing up around on either side of this ramp, all very lush and pretty. Sort of unusual flowers too. They didn't have quite a real look about them. So I came to another room which had this boy sitting in it and the boy was about 14 and he was reading something. I knocked on the door and he came to it and let me in and for some reason I was very happy to see him. I never saw him before that I know of, but I was sort of attracted by him. I wanted to kiss him, but he pushed me away and said no because his parents were in the next room. And I thought this was very unusual because I thought most people didn't get here all in one group. It really did seem to be in the underworld or after death and I wondered how he and his parents could have all gotten here at the same time and all be in the same place. His parents were very, very old. They were white-haired and they were both tall and thin, and they were just sitting in the next room on straight back chairs with their hands folded, not looking exactly dead like, but like they might have been in their 70's. It seemed the boy didn't say anything, his parents didn't say anything, but it seems that I understood or knew somehow that this boy had killed somebody or was some sort of psychotic and had been sent here and his parents had come as guardians to be sure he didn't do anything like this again, although who he was planning to kill, I'm not sure since it seemed to be the world of the dead. And even though these people are flesh and blood and quite alive, and yet they were dead in some way. I wasn't. I was, I had gotten down here sort of free or something, but at any rate I don't know exactly what happened. But all of a sudden I knew that this boy was dangerous and he was going to try to kill me or something. He had a knife and this piece of wood about a foot and a half long or so, and I had a piece of wood too. I don't know where I had found it, but it wasn't as long as his and he was trying to hit me with this piece of wood. I was trying to fight him off, but I knew that I wouldn't be too successful because his was longer than mine. So we started running thru all these lovely ramps and walkways thru all these pass ways, these rooms, around, upstairs and so forth in this long flight. Even though we were both running very fast, neither one of us seemed to get tired, and I wasn't really particularly scared. But I just wanted to get away from him. Something or somehow another I got his knife away from him. It was one of these, like a Boy Scout knife or some pocket knife, and I decided I would just get rid of him. And so I sort of stabbed him in his chest, but not very hard, cause I really couldn't, and I was going to make him jump off the ramp and just, well, it wasn't that far down to the ground, but at least I would get rid of him because he wouldn't be able to get back on it. So I kept threatening him with it and telling him to jump over the edge, but he wouldn't do it, and so finally, even though I had this knife, I started running away from him again. This time I was trying to get rid of him and remembered my keys and knew I could get rid of him by going into the doors numbered this, but I didn't know what keys he might have and I didn't know if he could follow me or not. I had this feeling he wouldn't be able to, but still to stop long enough to open the door and then lock it again, he would catch up with me. So I was running and running and we ran up, finally we came to where, in fact, the ramp did run right along the ground and there was a big plain, flat and just with grass on it. This ramp or walkway now you might call it was a big building which was a school and so we ran there. I was, of course, running away from him and I tried to lose myself in the mazes of this school some way. But even though I ran inside the building and started running down the stairs, he could easily spot me because all the girls in the school had these white lab coats and I didn't. I just had ordinary clothes, sort of dark clothes, and so I ran down some flights of stairs with him running after me, and I got down to the place where all these Negro janitors were going home and they were all lined up. There was this immense number of them and they were just all lined up in a row, and they had the same outfits. There was something strange about them because they were all so much alike, but then I knew they'd be going down into the tunnel and it would be different from the ones we ordinarily used, and so I knew if I got in there with them, this other person wouldn't' suspect where I was, so I did get in and the door was closed behind me and I was safe. Then the scene shifted to a larger view. I believe there was a P.A. system and an announcement was made over it that this girl had just reached the gift shop. And I think it was called the Shop of Mercy and Hate on the 3rd level, and that, therefore, she was free and this girl was me. When you got to this shop apparently, whatever it was, you had your choice between these two things, and if you picked the right one, you would be able to go. If you were dead when you reached this and you wanted to, you would be able to get back to the living world again. Even though I wasn't dead, but this also I was going to get. So the boy was sort of upset that he had missed out on this, and so he went up around the ramps and walkways till he got close to where the gift shop was supposed to be, and there the girl came out and she was thinking, well, even though this boy had been chasing her and she hadn't liked it, that if she saw him she would be merciful to him. And she was walking along with this person, whether it was a man or woman, I don't know, all dressed in white, some sort of angel, I guess, a very superior being. There was a shelf over the door and I believe it was the door to the gift shop that had all these cheeses sitting on it and most of these were, I forget the name of them, the kind that are wrapped in wax and some of them weren't. And apparently it had rained because some of them were soggy looking, but I was sort of back with this girl now and had a package of cheese, and it wasn't quite the same kind, but it was unusual cheese. And I don't think I ever saw one exactly like it because it had a lot of holes in it like Swiss cheese, and it was sliced very thin and it had sort of a reddish something, coloration, some fluid. Well, this boy was walking along behind us and I had this cheese, and so I stopped and asked him if he wanted some. I don't know, but anyway he did, and so I and this angel character and this boy all stood around and ate several slices of cheese and bread and apparently I was going off to the airport or something to be taken back to where I was supposed to be, and this is where I and the angel were headed to, the airport. Right then we were just standing there eating this cheese and that was about the end of the dream."
"120"	"(11/07/62)"	"I was up where I used to work in the Biology Dept., only it wasn't quite set up the way it was when I worked there. I was going up there to study, and I had some books with me, and I had an office up there, an office which had been checked out to me by the technician for the whole Biology Dept., Mrs. Wood, whom I like very much. This little office, it seems as though my husband was going to come in and join me later because I had some of his stuff too, including a very strange alarm clock with a very loud tick. And I went into this very small little room with a bed in it with just a mattress. It didn't have any sheets or anything and a chair or two, I think, nothing else in particular -- no books or anything. I was just getting settled when the door opened and these three boys came in dragging chairs after them just as if they owned the place. They said they were going to be studying for a quiz and I told them that this was my office, but they didn't seem at all inclined to get out. And I didn't know exactly what to do about them because even though it was my office, I felt like I didn't have a real clear right to it, and I didn't know if these boys were medical students or not and they might have just as much right to it as I did. Then nothing was very clearly resolved. That part of the dream got pretty muddled. The next part of the dream that I can remember, I can't remember very clearly, was a sort of confused thing. It was as if I were reading a story about this thing and then got involved in it. It was about a captain of a boat, a small boat in the south seas somewhere and his partner and these two ladies that they were taking with them somewhere who were passengers on their boat. The captain and his mate had gone ashore in a little rowboat to get the mail, and the captain noticed as they were getting ready to go back again that these two ladies were talking to the natives that ran the boat, this little steamer, and seemed to be planning something. The captain and the mate decided that they weren't really giving anything to these ladies to do and were sort of bored and everything, and they were thinking how they could fix this up. All these people -- the captain and the mate were some -- no, the captain was about in his late 50's, although he didn't look it at all. He looked much younger. The mate was in his 30's and these ladies were sort of indeterminate age. They were somewhere in their 40's, I believe. Anyway, they headed back in the rowboat for the steamer and the captain felt very old and tired and didn't want to go on any more. He thought how peaceful it would be just to quit everything and just to drift away, and when they got back to the boat, to the steamer, they couldn't get on it. In the first place, it had turned into an automobile, just sitting there in the water somehow, and whey they tried to get on it, they finally did get on it, onto the top of the automobile, and which started spinning around and doing all these fantastic gyrations in the water for no visible reason. It just did this, spinning around at these real terrific speeds, and one of the ladies lost her foot. The automobile would rock back and forth, from side to side, and her foot got caught under it and went floating off. The captain was much distressed and said, ""Heck, we'll have to stop and retrieve that foot somehow, and maybe we can do something for you."" The ladies went into gales of laughter because it wasn't a real foot at all. It was a wooden one."
"121"	"(11/07/62)"	"The dream started with my walking around the house in which we lived in the dream with my daughter, so we were taking a walk around the block. This house was set on a long lot that sloped down from the far back of the lot down to the street in front. On the far back of the lot a street ran past and then beside the house, to the left of it as you face it, was a long driveway that reached from the back street to the front street. I was out walking my daughter around the house and when I got up to the top of the hill in the back, my husband called me to come back home, that he needed something or other in this sort of demanding voice. So I came. I left my daughter playing with something right there on the edge of the back lot and came in or down to the house and I don't remember exactly what he wanted. I don't know if he even said in the dream. We were inside. I believe I brought my daughter in and a whole troop of mothers and children came walking thru our back yard and I thought I didn't particularly want them to be there, so I closed the back door and locked it because I figured if we weren't out in the yard, they couldn't stay there. But one came right up to the door and knocked on it, so I asked what they wanted. She wanted to tell me that the people who are our next door neighbors in actually here in these apts., this Negro couple, had found people to keep their children while they were working. I said, well, I'm very glad, but I didn't care and why were they telling me. Then they announced that all these kids were going to play in our driveway and I didn't like the idea. there seemed to be just swarms of them. It looked like there were about 20 or 30 people altogether, and I thought my daughter was in the house. But I looked out and she was in the back yard and playing with something and this big girl came up to her and took it away from her. I went out and I think it was a big stick or something and I took it away from the big girl and threw it away and said we shouldn't play with things like that, and we should play nice or not play at all. Then the scene shifted and I was getting a collection of rocks together. I collect rocks. And I was going to take them down and give them to this lady in this little gift shop who sold rocks. So I took a little bag of them down and for some reason, I had painted them all. I said it was with fingernail polish, but it was some sort of sticky dark bluish greyish with some pink overtones in it, clay of some sort that I had dipped on my rock. I took them down and gave it to the lady. I put them in one of our teapots and so she took a pair of scissors and cut the teapot apart. And I was a little bit amazed that she could do this, but I believe they were a special sort of scissors and so she marked my name on the teapot and apparently she was going to appraise these rocks and pay me for them. And she was down in the basement of this building, which turned out to be a library, but at the present time it was a house and it was a house where I used to live in and I was with this boy, I guess about my age, and we both had books. We were going to some function, some celebrity or other was coming and we were going to see him. And this boy was also connected with some local television studio, the one on campus, and he was going to be helping to run the cameras and all. But at any rate, we were walking along on the same floor as this lady's little tiny shop was and we came to a room that had been my room, but was my sister's room now. But she wasn't there because she was in college and I said, ""I haven't been in this room since I started school,"" meaning about 5 years or so. And so I went in and looked around, trying to find something familiar in it, and trying to feel a sort of sense of remembering all these events and things that you feel when you haven't been in a place for a long time, and it was my room, although in the dream it was nothing like it actually was, my room at home was. Actually it hasn't been that long since I've seen my room at home, but this was a very old-fashioned-looking room. It would remind me more of something that would be in my grandmother's house than anything in our house in my hometown. There were paintings and things on the wall and all of them were changed a little bit from what they were supposed to have been originally and it looked very nice, but it all looked very alien. In a couple of minutes we left and started up the stairs and we had several flights of stairs to go up. And this was also partly a library and I wanted to return about 4 or 5 books that I had before we went down and found our seats for this event. And the boy stopped to adjust a television camera where two flights of stairs went down with this great space between them, these curving type of stairs that meet after having gone down a flight and he was on the other side of these stairs, the other flight of stairs arranging this camera, and it looked very dangerous to me. He was arranging it right over the rail and there was this big drop below it, but finally he finished and we were going on up. The stairs were, we were almost up to the level of the library and the stairs were circular and the steps got very small and very strangely put together, very extremely slippery; they were marble, and I couldn't get up them. And I kept trying to and I dropped my books and they slipped quite a ways down. And the boy went down and retrieved them for me, and I think this dream, no we finally did get up to the top of the stairs, but it took a long time. It was awfully difficult, but we finally got up to the top and I was going to return my books and everything."
"122"	"(11/08/62)"	"I was in a large 12-story building and I was on the first floor and this was a rather unusual building because when you were on the first floor you were supposed to help children who were there learn how to play with these certain toys and certain puzzles and you didn't know exactly what you were supposed to do besides help them. But if you did a certain thing and it was the right thing, then a door on the wall across from where you would be, rather a doorway, it was just an opening, would turn a strange shade. It would start glowing this reddish, brownish color, and you would go over to it then and you would be able to go thru it and you would be on the next level of the building. But if you went over to the doorway when it wasn't in this shape you would just be somewhere else on the 1st level but you wouldn't go up to the next one. The idea was that on each floor you were supposed to help children with some toy or something that was a little bit more difficult than on the level before that I did this and finally reached the top level, the 12th level. And this was supposed to be a spiritual ascent so that when I reached the 12th level I had this tremendous feeling of love for everybody that was around me and everybody that existed. Here I was trying to help a child, I and another person who had reached that level also, a little boy who wasn't really supposed to be on this level at all so we had to go back down to the 1st level to get some toys and things to help him with."
"123"	"(11/10/62)"	"My sister and I were looking at pictures of various places, and making up songs about them and singing. And the first place was this little cottage set back in the woods, and there were some scenes. There was this scene of some prehistoric towns and there were all these dinosaurs walking around in it and the scene would become very vivid as you looked at it as though it were real, and all these things were alive. Then we came to a scene that had some animals and also had some wild buffaloes in particular. We sort of got into this scene somehow though we were still where we were, and started going up to the wild buffaloes, and they were huge animals, well they were buffalo-sized animals, and this one started chasing us. We had got it mad. We had been teasing it or something and so it was our fault, and we ran back to this house and tried closing the door. There were two doors and we kept teasing it and it got madder and madder, and we knew it could break down the door and come right on in and it was very dangerous. So we ran upstairs in this house which was turned out to be my parent's house, but was not very much like theirs in reality, and ran into my mother's bedroom and hid in her closet which was in the dream, a quite big room. We hid behind the clothes and we figured if the buffaloes came in and looked around, they couldn't see us, that it would finally go away. There were some other animals with it by this time, a wolf or something too. Mother came in and found out that we were hiding from this thing. She said we ought to stay in the closet and she was going to take care of it because she didn't have very much time to take care of it because she was going up to the mountains for the weekend. She wanted my husband and I to come along, but I said I couldn't because I had quizzes next week, which I do. That must have been this weekend I was dreaming about. We stayed there n the closet for a little while more, all sort of curled up in the corner. Finally I guess the buffalo had gone and we were able to leave."
"124"	"(11/10/62)"	"I had started off I was reading this comic book and watching this cartoon, and it had all these little children playing on the swings and a couple of the children, Chinese-American or something, came up to the little children and wanted to play with them. The kids were chasing these little children away and wouldn't let them play, and I didn't think that was fair and so it became a real scene. I went with one of these little children, or maybe a couple of them, over to the -- all these children's swings were on trees, and I went over to this tree not too far from where they were playing where these tree crabs live. And these didn't look like any ordinary crabs because they had only four legs instead of -- how many do they have -- 12? They didn't have any real big claws on them, but we were trying to chase this big one to these other trees, and it wasn't very easy because it would keep scrambling up trees that we would pass and we kept getting them down. And finally it scuttled up to this hollow place, and scuttled way back inside of that, but there were a lot of baby crabs on this tree. So we got a small one and finally got it over to the playground where the kids were and let it go and trying to make it go up the tree because we sort of wanted it to bother the kids because they hadn't been nice. It didn't seem to bother them particularly. The scene shifted then and I was in this office-type building where it was late on a Sunday afternoon and all these girls working in there were dressed rather nicely. They had had to come in for extra work for some reason, something say like a hospital where people would have to work all the time, even though most people wouldn't be working on that day. I was sitting there waiting for somebody or something, and sitting in this small office I picked up this big catalog, complete book binding catalog, and when I opened it, it had sample books and different ways of binding them that this place would bind them for you. But I didn't look at it too long because in my dream I had seen it somewhere before. Then the scene was confused, but it shifted to our apartment and we were having my French instructor, Dr. Anderson, a man in his 50's, over and I don't know how I had done this, but he was over and we were talking to him. Then we had somebody else over too, but I can't remember who it was. But we all sort of drifted apart and we didn't have anything to say to each other. My husband and this other person, boy, said they were sleepy and were going off into the bedroom and take a little nap. I was terribly embarrassed that I had invited this professor over who I think is very brilliant, to just leave him there. Finally we all did get back out into the living room and couldn't think of very much to say. My parents and my little 10-year-old brother came in, and they all sat down and I thought, My goodness, they won't have anything in common with him."" And so it was all very embarrassing and everything."
"125"	"(11/11/62)"	"The dream concerned this little man who was evil and who had somebody that I liked in his power, and I was trying to fight with him, it seems like, and get him to release them or whatever. We were down in the basement of this house. There were a lot of tools around, and we were using screwdrivers and wrenches and various things in this fight because I guess I was trying to kill him. Finally it seemed I wasn't getting anywhere, and so I was going to go. Then he said, ""If you really want to save this person, you really need some of my blood,"" and so as I was trying to kill him again, and I noticed something that I hadn't seen down there before was this sort of long, well I guess it was a machete, this knife with a big handle. It was about 3 feet long. So I picked that up and hit him with it on the foot. I really didn't expect it to do anything, but it seemed to be very sharp and then I cut him on the neck a couple of times and he fell down and was dead. Then I found some Kleenex that I was getting. There wasn't actually a whole lot of blood, but I was getting some on his Kleenex in order to save this person. The little man who I had killed then turned out to be my mother, and it was my sister who I was going to save. I wasn't at all upset that this was my mother that I had just killed. The only thing that worried me was that I was probably going to get caught. So I took this knife, which now turned out to be a saw, an ordinary carpenter's saw, and I took some Kleenex and sort of wiped over it, carefully trying to get any fingerprints there might have been off of it. Then I went on upstairs from this basement. The basement was quite a bit like the one in my husband's home in his hometown, but upstairs it was like our house in my hometown. My brother was in the kitchen with this big pile of laundry he was getting to go down in the basement with and I thought, ""Well, when he gets down there, he's going to see mother lying down there dead."" So I walked on thru the den or somewhere and there was mother. I was a little bit surprised, and she said she hadn't been feeling too well lately. She had some sort of an allergy or rash on her throat. I thought, ""Well then that's awfully strange. Maybe there's two of them and I just killed the one."" I was neither glad nor sorry to see that she was still there. But anyhow, I went up to where my sister was and she was in bed and took these Kleenex out to put on her. These were supposed to cure her. I don't know what sort of disease she had, but it made all these small sores on her and so I put one of these Kleenex on her breast and one on her head. It seemed to be helping her a lot and making her feel a lot better."
"126"	"(11/11/62)"	"I was with my husband. We were in the car and we were going on a trip somewhere. We stopped at a little restaurant and my husband was getting something to eat, but I couldn't get anything for some reason and I was sort of irritated by this because he was refusing to let me get anything."
"127"	"(11/11/62)"	"I was talking to my Modern French instructor and telling him I was unhappy that I was unable to pronounce French any better than I was. He said yes, it was too bad, and he started showing me what would happen if I ever went to France and the difficulties I was going to have making myself understood. As he told me this, I was sort of there. I was in this hotel and I had this personal maid who was helping me take my bags up to my room and everything. There was a fairly long sequence in the dream in which it was just getting us from the main floor of the hotel up to the floor that my room was on because it seemed as if we stopped at every floor and did something or other."
"128"	"(11/11/62)"	"The dream involved these people tearing this house down. It seems they were going to tear it down to rebuild it across the road. It didn't make a whole lot of sense. They were starting it in a very odd way. They were tearing down the foundation first and leaving most of the house still standing up. It would seem to be a rather dangerous procedure because the rest of the house, pieces of it would collapse and onto them. I and this girl and this big Negro man were most concerned with getting the house torn down. A whole lot of people had come out presumably to help. It seemed like sort of an old-fashioned thing with everyone pitching in, all your friends and neighbors to help you put up a house or something. These people were all friends and neighbors of whoever this house belonged to. It was Sunday afternoon and they all brought all sorts of fruit and everything. They were just sitting there having a big picnic while we were trying to get the house torn down, and I didn't think it was right that they wouldn't help. We were trying to get them to do so, but they wouldn't do it."
"129"	"(11/14/62)"	"I was in this dime store. The room was very, very big and very swanky and very fancy and nice and modern. A very nice place to shop. It had a very big ladies room which, however, instead of being nice like the rest of the places, it was very filthy and in horrible condition so nobody would even want to go in it. This sort of upset me, but it seemed that they should do something about it since the rest of their store was so nice. I don't usually do things like this. I went up to find the manager or whoever I should speak to about it. Finally someone seemed like the likely person to tell about it, and so I started telling her what I thought about this. And she said yes, and somebody else had just come in and was telling this person over there about it. So we, I and this other person, it turned out to be this girl Diane who is the wife of a graduate student in Psychology here, started telling her about it and talking to each other about it. Sometime later, maybe not the same day, I came back to the store and I wondered if they had done anything about it, so I went into the ladies room. Sure enough, it was real nice and clean and I was glad that they had fixed it."
"130"	"(11/14/62)"	"I was driving home from school, and I don't drive in reality, and in my dream I was learning how. And I was driving home from the university. The whole dream as I remember was concerned with steering the car, turning corners and stopping at lights and things like this."
"131"	"(11/14/62)"	"I was talking to this girl who is about 30 and from Argentina in Comparative Literature, and somebody else who I didn't know in my dream and I don't know. We were talking about a variety of things. One of them was about this weird practice with graduate students which both of these girls were, had to, it was sort of voluntary, they didn't have to do it, when they would go out into this big parking lot, the bell tower parking lot behind campus and one of the instructors would be there, and it wouldn't be their advisor, although one of the older men in the department. And for this person they would sit down right there and write an essay on some subject. Then this would be graded and it would be rather an important part of their graduate career. But they were saying to made everybody shy away from choosing this rather than whatever else they could choose. It was like no one ever got a good grade on these things, and it seemed rather strange because none of the instructors ever seemed to take into account that you were writing it there right in front of him, not at home polishing it, and that you didn't have a typewriter with you and so you had to write with a pen instead of being able to type it neatly. The girl from Argentina was going to do one and she had a rather strange topic. It was on the sexual customs of the Ecuadorian husband. And she had written quite a bit about it and was going to use it for a topic, but she had been discouraged by somebody - not either of us, I don't believe - from using it and so we were trying to suggest how she might modify it somehow. Since she was in Comparative Literature, she might give a comparative study of husbands in different countries. When we were sitting there, it had got dark and it was night, in the middle of the night, a very dark night with hundreds and hundreds of stars and a few little clouds in the sky. This other girl and I started talking about the bear gods of Siberia. I had a class in just a few minutes. It was the middle of the night, but it was also about a quarter to twelve and I had a twelve o'clock class. Then I was very intrigued and fascinated by this and I was talking about initiation rites and all the rituals and everything. I was so intrigued by this that I thought perhaps in a past life I had been in one of these tribes or something and participated in this ritual."
"132"	"(11/18/62)"	"I was in the grocery store doing my weekly shopping and I had gotten to the checkout counter. And there was a little orange cat in the store and it was supposed to be very dearly loved by some group of policemen in another city, mascot or something, but here the police didn't like it and there was a policeman who was trying to catch it. It was running under the checkout counter. The little cat was hiding and the policeman was bending down to get it. I went over and told the cat to bite the policeman, but the cat didn't and the policeman picked it up and walked out with it and I thought the policeman would say something nasty to me because I had told the cat to bite him, but he didn't say anything. So I went back around, and this checkout girl who was checking out my groceries and the girl at the counter beyond that were in sympathy with the cat too and the people who owned it and I was in sympathy with it too. We thought that they were going to try this cat and put it in jail. It seemed sort of silly, but that's what was going to happen. So we were all going to write postcards to the higher court or something telling them what we thought about the case. So the girl at my checkout counter had some postcards that were sort of form postcards for this sort of thing because they had several questions to answer briefly. It would seem to be sort of unusual questions for this sort of thing because, for instance, one asked if the tires on your car were worn and another one asked what made you different from the people who are writing in postcards about this thing. I said we the people who wrote in had more concern for others than the people who didn't, but I finally did finish filling out the postcard and then I wrote a check for my groceries, and went out to the car and my mother and my older brother and my sister and my daughter were all waiting there in the car for me. My mother had brought me to think I made them wait for hours and hours. I was quite sorry about it, but we all got in the car and mother started driving. She just drove real recklessly and it was really very upsetting, pulled out into the car where all these cars were zipping along at about 60 and she just pulled out and we went so slow she had to stop and start over again. Meanwhile all these cars piled up around her and almost ran into her and lots of them had to run off the road because they were going so fast. She didn't particularly care to be rebuked about it. She didn't think there was anything particularly wrong about the way she was driving. We were starting to drive thru this very small town when I was sort of a car and sort of a horse, more of a horse, and I was sort of just pretending to be one which was very strange. But at any rate I was going thru this very small town. I was cantering along when I met this sign that said all horses must proceed at a trot so I slowed down to a trot and stopped at several stop lights. Finally came into a little narrow corridor. This whole town was famous for its antiques. There were lots of antiques along the streets before, but now I was in this little house which displayed all sorts of them, part of the town and part of the main street. I trotted along slowly looking at them and turned the corner and went down this narrow little hall, turned again, and there was this sign saying you are now leaving this park, Hallborough. And so I was back out in the open again. That was about the end of that dream. Hallborough, which is next to my university town, is about the most unhistoric place you can think of. The most uninteresting of anything. The little town of Millsborough which is a little ways away would be a much better place for this thing."
"133"	"(11/18/62)"	"I was going to take a course in a hospital. It was a course for nursing students. It was on child development and children's diseases, and I was wandering thru the hospital at night trying to find the exit so I could get out in the front and then I could find the entrance that I wanted so I would be at the right place for this class. So I finally did and asked the instructor if I could audit and he said yes it would. It was going to run for several years, but that was right with me because it would take child development as long as my children were developing. That would be fine with me."
"134"	"(11/20/62)"	"There was a big battle taking place between two countries. I imagine it was the U.S. and Russia and I was on the U.S. side and then the U.S. side was located on this side of this great big mountain, the other side being down below us, on this very steep side of the mountain, not quite a straight down cliff, but very steep. There they were on this flat plain and where we were was a fairly flat plain too just that we were that much higher. In this was neither side had a great concentration of soldiers. There was no thought of using nuclear weapons or anything like this and I and this general who might have been my husband were the main leaders on our side and this king and queen were supposed to be the leaders on the other side and they were very sweet and gentle people, but their main military commander was a very ruthless person. He was just an evil person and took delight in killing everybody, and he was enjoying this war. We were enjoying it too and as a matter of fact, everyone would have enjoyed it if it hadn't been for this one general and he was too serious about it. Apparently the things we were doing weren't damaging anybody except for the things he was doing. He was not only ruthless, he was also invincible, more invincible than most people because he wore this heavy armor or something. It seems this is all sort of background. When it started, the general on our side had left his staff car part down near where the king and queen were on the other side. He had gone down there to talk with him or something. I asked, ""Well, how are we doing for ammunition. Do we have enough seeds?"" And apparently we were shooting seeds at people. It was about the size of bird seed. I can't imagine how that would hurt anybody, but that's what we were using and he said, ""Well, we still have plenty of that and I left a big sack of it down behind the staff car."" Then I asked, ""Well, how about bullets?"" and we had plenty of those too. I was worried about his leaving the ammunition down there because if somebody found it, they would take it. Sure enough, we looked down and the staff car wasn't there anymore, and I knew it had been this wicked general who had taken it. So we got some very high-powered rifles and went over to the edge of the mountain and looked down and we saw that the general had taken the staff car and turned it into a staff motorboat because it still had this official black look to it, but it was now a boat and he was standing beside it and we knew he had the seeds inside the motorboat. So we shouted at him or something and showed him that we were going to shoot at him. He acted as if he didn't care. He walked a little ways back from the boat. He just stood there sort of waiting for us. Then a very curious thing happened to him, and he walked away and sort of left a shell of himself standing there, but we shot at that and it collapsed into a big heap of clothing. But anyway, he was gone away from the boat and we went down and got the seeds. I suggested that we shoot a hole in the bottom of the boat so he couldn't use it, but I don't remember if we did or not. We went back up at the top and I decided that we really had to shoot this general because the king and queen were really gentle people. We wouldn't mind fighting a war with them because they were right nice, but this general was too mean and we were just going to have to get rid of him. It was a very strange war because I don't think we were actually trying to kill anybody and killing the general was sort of an unheard of thing, even though it was war. So I think we were trying to do this when that dream ended."
"135"	"(11/20/62)"	"The dream started out in my hometown in the house my family lived in when we first moved there. It seemed to be in the summer because I and my younger brother seemed to be outside in the driveway and it was a real bright and pretty day. We were doing something, but mainly we were waiting for my older brother to get back from town somewhere. He had taken the car and gone uptown and he was going to bring back something that was connected with some hobby of my little brother. So he did come home and there is some confusing stuff. I was with my parents and some older couple at this cafeteria again somewhere getting lunch. I had gotten a rather strange lunch, a strange assortment of things, all sorts of vegetables sort of jumbled up together. And everybody else had gotten something quite different from what I had gotten and not as much, so I was embarrassed that I had gotten more than anybody else. But I decided that I had some excuse that I was pregnant, but that didn't seem like a very good excuse to me. So we were getting ready to sit down and start eating and two confusing things were happening here at once. For one thing, something was on my chair which I had to wipe off before I could sit down, and there was somebody else in the cafeteria that my mother wanted me to go talk to or something. So between these two things it was taking me a long time to sit down and everybody else was eating, but finally I did get to sit down."
"136"	"(11/21/62)"	"The dream had something to do with the electrical power and how in emergencies there would be emergency sources of power. And I believe that this was in the whole U.S. that someone was demonstrating this on a map and showing how much emergency power would be available if all the regular sources were. It was an awful lot. It was almost as much as the original amount. Then from being something very impersonal, it switched to being something I was very involved in, in which from someplace a huge flood was coming and everybody in the world, I guess, was going to be affected by it. We were making plans as to what to do and somebody who I presume was a Civil Defense officer, was in our house and saying how many people he was going to have to put in it. We were in our bedroom, which is quite small, and he was saying so many people would have to stand on the bed and so many other people would have to stand on their shoulders. So he was lining everybody up and we got a goodly number of people in the room, 30 or 40 people anyway, and the water was rising very fast. Before he had gotten all the people arranged in the room, it was up to right up outside the windows, so it was about 4 or 5 ft. high and it was at night that was happening, or at least there wasn't very much light. The water was real dark with this sort of foam on the top of it in places and it kept rising and rising and then it came into the room. Before very long at all, it was almost to the top of the little window, which was in my dream near the ceiling which was just about big enough to get out of. So when it got to that, we knew we would all have to go out. Then we didn't know exactly when this would happen, but about the time that it got there, we were preparing to go out."
"137"	"(11/21/62)"	"I was at this party being given by some people I had known in high school, some twins Jerry and Lennie and other people who were in that crowd, and there was a boy there who I didn't know who seemed to be aggressive sexually and I don't know how he did it, but he had gotten one of my bra straps off and I was working with it and trying not to let anybody see that I was fooling with it because I didn't want anybody else to know that this had happened. At the same time I was sort of attracted by this boy and I didn't much mind that he had done it, but finally I went into the bathroom to fool with it and there were some very complicated pieces of machinery connected with this bra strap and how to put it back. The central part of it was missing and it was out in the room and I didn't see how I could go back out there with all these people and go back out there and find it. So I finally fixed it the best I could. This restroom had two doors, one of the opened to where this party was and the other opened to where these sort of Mexican-looking people were and then it turned out that I and several other girls were going to take part in a revolution to win Cuba back and we were going down there to fight. All we had to do was to go thru this door and we would be there, so we went thru the door and there wasn't too much fighting going on. We were wandering around the stores and looking at various things. Then this one girl and I, this girl who looked like Olivia, the Argentine graduate student, looked out the window and there were thousands and thousands of airplanes and we heard this roar and there were thousands of airplanes. They were way up in the sky so they were small, and at first we thought they were going to drop bombs, but they were dropping leaflets and some of them had these Nazi emblems on them. And when we noticed that, we looked around and there were all these soldiers in uniform and rifles standing around, standing around everybody and looking at everybody, and they took us and about 20 other people and herded us into this corner and lined up in front of were these machine guns. And they were going to shoot us and they were against both the US and the Russians and we didn't know why they were shooting us. And some French soldiers came down trying to rescue us, but they shot some bullets at them and they went back and they came back in a little while, the French did, with all these gas tanks which they had lighted and shoved into this room where we and all the soldiers were. So pretty soon I wasn't in it any more, all the innocent ones and the Nazis were killed, and then there was this huge, terrific battle and it was very terrible and our side seemed to be winning. And at the very last I had this book in my hands, this big paperback red-bound book saying that the side that won the revolution and I guess I was getting ready to open it, although I was pretty sure our side had won, when I woke up. It was a very frightening dream."
"138"	"(11/21/62)"	"I was taking some course in chemistry, some sort of quantitative course, and was in the lab trying to perform some sort of experiment. This went on for quite a while with some of the details of the apparatus and everything and what I was doing, and then the scene shifted somehow and I was upstairs in this house. Somebody was with me, and from coming up the stairs was this other person, also known to the person who was with me, and this person's assistant. They were trying to get, there was some sort of gate at the top of the stairs, and they were trying to get over the gate to get to me, and I was trying to get them back. The person who was with me wouldn't have anything to do about it, although he was a friend of the other two men. The leading man was sometimes my husband, I believe. The other person wasn't posing a real threat to me because he was stupid. The two people who were attacking me were monks belonging to some order or another, and if they got me, then I was going to have to join their monastery. The leading one had a knife and a hammer, a primitive knife and hammer, the hammer being the sort of thing you would beat on a tom-tom with. I would fight them off, and it was just a series of repeated incidents in which they would come up the stairs and I would knock them back down the stairs or throw them over the railings or something, but nothing seemed to faze them at all. So finally I just left. I decided this was never going to do and they would eventually get me here, so I climbed out the window. I was about on the second or third story, but I didn't seem to have too much trouble getting down. I started running just as fast as I could and I had to keep climbing over these walls and climbing down them, all of them very high walls, but not seeming to bother me too much. I was running faster than anyone could possibly run, but I knew without looking that these people were right behind me. I finally got down to the woods and here I decided I could hide. I sort of hid under these bushes. Two men looking for me walked right past very close to me, and I thought they would go away, but then they turned back and found me."
"139"	"(11/27/62)"	"This dream seems to be one immensely long dream composed of all these different episodes very thinly tied together. The first episode concerned my taking a walk here in this student housing and I was quite a few blocks away from home when I saw these two children of a close neighbor of mine, Judy, playing in the street. The youngest of these children is only 14 months old. It always seems strange to me that she lets these children wander around without watching them and here they were. Then someone used to be a neighbor of ours, Meredith, was out walking and so we started walking together and I was telling her how I thought it was strange that Judy would let her children do this. So we walked back. I was talking somewhat genially which is strange because I didn't particularly care for this woman. When I got back home, I got involved in looking at all these deeds. It seems that the town has put up all these lots for auction, of lots that hadn't had their taxes paid on them. Somehow or another my husband and I had gotten one of these lots. It was number 70-11. It was way out in a national park, right beside a lake. It was a little lot right on a lake. We had gotten it and there were all these nice logs that were cut down on it which were ours too which we could use to have a cabin built for us. So this was very nice. We were out there looking over our lot and as we were, there seemed to be a cabin on it. At first there was just some furniture left there by the rangers for whoever used the site and then it was a cabin and I was looking thru some drawers and found these comic books and things. So I was looking thru them to see what kind of comic books they were. There was one comic book that was very strange. It had a picture on the cover of this woman with these tiny thin-boned arms, although the rest of her wasn't particularly thin, and a very strange sort of person. What she was, was a vampire that fed on energy and life. I'm not exactly sure what she did, but when she touched a person, they would just sort of disintegrate or something like that. So she captured this one little girl and she was going to feed her certain pills and turn her into this same sort of thing. Incidentally, after looking at the cover, the story sort of started unfolding in front of me, and I wasn't reading the story. The little girl got away from her. Then some person, an Indian, an American Indian, came up and knew how to stop this woman with certain magic powers that he or she had. So he did and then he decided he would become the same kind of thing and cause other people to also. So then this went on till apparently everybody in the world had been turned into this type of thing and everything was trying to devour everything else for the energy in it, even the buildings and the earth. Then he and his two accomplices decided that this had gone far enough and it was time to change everything back. They were in this bleak landscape. They were the only three persons left because everybody else had been devoured. So they stood on the edge of this building and raised their arms over the bleak countryside and started doing whatever it was that they did. First it seemed like nothing was going to happen. It had gone too far for them to reverse it. Then these ghosts appeared, little wispy will-o-the-wisp ghosts, people who had been in this state who had been devoured. He called all these ghosts up, all these haggard, worn-looking ghosts with these sunken faces and circles under their eyes, told them to return to their original forms, so they all did and became young and happy again. They could also help to change others back. All these immense swarms of ghosts were coming up, all these people who wanted to devour others in this way, and so they were chasing them back. Their leaders were going to go over to Europe and everywhere and change all the people there back and everything was going to be like it was before. Then there was another episode that concerned a boy that I read for and I was going to read for him and another one of his readers - I don't know whether there actually is such a person, named Nancy - was there. Al and she were talking about plowing fields, sowing seeds and so forth, a symbol for man's having intercourse and having children and so forth. It seemed to embarrass this girl and she got up and left when they started talking about it, so I sat down and we started talking about it for a little while. Then he started putting his arm around me and things and I wasn't particularly upset by this except for the fact that we were in this public place and all these people might see us. So I was trying to get him to stop and I wasn't having a whole lot of success because he seemed to be very single-minded in his approach. But finally I did get him to stop. I went to the ladies room and then I came back."
"140"	"(11/28/62)"	"I was telling these other couple of girls about my experiences spending a night in a hotel room with a traveling salesman, and how he slept and I tried to sleep, but he snored all night; and how the next night I wished that he wouldn't snore and he didn't because he stayed awake and kept making passes at me. These girls were sort of horrified and I was telling them some things about it, and they were telling me that sometimes in these hotel rooms they had thee TV cameras hooked up to the rooms and might put you on a program without you knowing about it. I didn't tell them anything more, but in actuality I hadn't slept with this man and I also knew I was going to have a baby by him. It was the next morning and I was going into this little grocery store to buy something before I started on my trip to somewhere or another. I bought a big bottle of grape soda and something else, something sort of strange, and went outside and met somebody there I used to know when I worked up in the Biology Dept., this woman in her middle 30's. And she said, ""You know, I saw this television program last night and saw this girl and this man in this hotel room and it stopped just at the most interest point."" I said, ""Well, did she go to bed with him?"" and she said, ""Well, it didn't show that,"" and I said, ""Well, what do you think?"" and she didn't say much. So I knew that she knew that it was me, but I didn't seem particularly concerned about it and we were standing on a corner and she was going to cross the street one way and I was going to cross it another way. So I just waved bye-bye to her and stepped out into the street. And I stepped out against the light and it was this big street in this big city and there was a lot of traffic on it. All of a sudden there were these huge trucks rushing towards me and I thought I was going to be killed, but I managed to avoid them and get over to the other side and I was pretty upset for having done this and for almost having gotten killed. So I thought maybe I was more concerned about what she had said than what I thought. Now the town that I was in was my hometown and this is a section of my hometown that occurs over and over again in my dreams. It's one long block down from the center of town, and it's a block that in actuality has nothing of the kind that I find in my dreams because it has office buildings and men's shops, a theater, but in my dreams it always has clothing stores on it and a couple of doors from the corner it has a little bakery. So I decided that since I almost had just been killed, I would stroll down the street a little to regain my equilibrium. I would shop around and look in some of the stores at their maternity clothes, and I would go down to this little bakery and get myself a chocolate éclair. So I walked along and the first stores that I came to had been changed. The first one was this exclusive shop for Negroes and had these Negro mannequins in the windows, then there was a small shop that said Creole Shop on it. I was intrigued by both of these, but I figured I had better not go in them. Then I came to where the bakery had been, and there was a new store there. And this store -- I can't imagine what they really sold -- but they were dazzling white. All their clothes and everything were dazzling white and they had all these models around in white outfits. And the bakery had been moved to sort of in back of this store, so I went back there and there it was, very small and the two girls who ran it, one white girl and one big Negro girl whom I knew from my dreams before. And so I asked them for a chocolate éclair and some cookies and they were very happy that they had a customer because apparently in this place in the store they didn't get very many. So I paid for it and walked back out."
"141"	"(11/30/62)"	"The first dream that I remember concerned an experiment with butterflies which have a bad taste to birds, supposedly, and the imitators that really taste good imitate the noxious ones so that the birds won't eat them either. And in this experiment they had used hawks and presented these butterflies to them, and it was very quickly found that after having tasted a couple of the noxious ones, they wouldn't try to eat the ones that were their imitators either. So this experiment had been done and then for some reason they wanted to see if these butterflies really tasted good or bad, and so they had this med student be presented, not exactly be presented with, but eat a couple of these butterflies. And the one that tasted bad was really terrible, and he was real distressed about, and he couldn't quite understand why he was in the experiment. And so I told him all about the details of the other experiments to sort of comfort him, I guess, and then I rubbed his head for him because that made him feel better. The idea for it was from the magazine that's put out by the Museum of Natural History in New York, had this article in it about frogs being presented with the harmful insects like bumblebees and then with their harmless imitators, and how quickly they learned not to take either one of them."
"142"	"(11/30/62)"	"Another dream I had concerned this young boy who was being held at this movie theatre because he had killed several people there, supposedly. And this was about a 14-year-old boy. And he had some connection with this girl I used to know in my hometown, Mary Lee, who spent quite a bit of time in mental hospitals at various times. And it seems that she had dated this boy or something. But at any rate, when I learned that this boy was being held, I went down to the theatre and I told the people at the box office to let the boy go because I knew who the murderer really was. And I told her that it was this girl, and I had some, not really proof for it, but I knew that it had been her and not this boy. For one thing, she was very strong and she was capable of getting into violent rages and everything. And so I was allowed to go inside the theatre where this sort of psychiatric hospital was set up, or at least this office for one, with all these records and all of these people sitting around this big counter, this square counter, with all these records in these boxes. And I happened to be reading one box, and there was something in there about this girl. It was part of her psychiatric record or something, how she had liked to imitate somebody who was this famous murderer. And how she could do it perfectly, or how she thought she could. And the head psychiatrist, who was sort of stupid, I tried to tell him of my suspicions. And he was letting this girl go thru all these boxes of records, and hers weren't just kept in one box; they might be scattered anywhere. And I knew the reason was she was trying to get rid of all this incriminating evidence against her. And I thought the guy was awfully stupid to let her go thru these, but I took out this one thing that she apparently hadn't come to yet, and gave it to someone and told them to hide it somewhere and not let anybody get it, cause this would be evidence against her. And then pretty soon the young boy came out; they were going to let him go with me. And he was dressed in this real ridiculous fashion. He was carrying this sort of toy rifle in this yellow plastic case, and brandishing it around and trying to look fierce. But he looked real silly. And he went out to the car where his father was waiting, a little Fiat, and then he -- I'm not exactly sure what he did -- but I thought I'd go out and talk to his father since I'd been the one who had gotten his son released. And I got into the car with him and we started going somewhere. I think his father lived on a farm or something. And so I was talking to him and comforting him, and we were driving down this very fine highway, and all of a sudden, when we turned a curve, the highway had disintegrated into this, it was just red mud. And so we slowed down real quick and stopped. And it seemed very strange that the highway should have done this all at once. And so we walked back and looked, and sure enough, the highway had curved the other way. So we were trying to get the car back up to the road to get on it. And then the man's son came, and started saying something about he hadn't, we should have done something because these newsmen were slandering him."
"143"	"(12/01/62)"	"The first dream I remember, my husband and I had moved to some large city in a nearby state. And this was, he had graduated and had his doctor's degree and we were going to live there. And it was a very big city and we were living sort of in the center of it, not out from it at all. And apparently we didn't have a car, because we had to go anywhere we wanted to go on these buses. And this was a pretty expensive way to go anywhere, and we didn't really know how to get from one place to another in the city. And we didn't know anybody in the city. But I had gone down to the bus stop to wait with my husband til he had caught his bus and started on his way to his office. And then I walked back to the apartment we had, and this was in a big Southern house, and it was very Southern in style and furnished in this sort of old-fashioned furniture. It was sort of a gloomy place. It had these big rooms and real high ceilings, and small windows. And I didn't know anybody there, and this old man and this woman about in her 40's came in, just came in my house from the porch where I guess they'd been sitting out there rocking or something. They came in and sat down in my living room. And it was a sort of friendly thing to do, but it was sort of unfriendly too because they sort of ignored me. And so I sort of ignored them, and wondered if they wanted to speak to me. And finally the woman asked me if she could help me with anything, and she started watering my potted plants, which I seemed to have several of. And one of these was, had been, a cactus at one time or another, but it sort of dried up. I had this real lonely feeling in it, to be in this new place and not knowing anybody."
"144"	"(12/01/62)"	"Then I had this dream that just started right in the middle of its action. It was WW III and everybody had gone frantic and was dropping bombs on everybody else, and there'd been already so many bombs dropped that everybody practically was going to be killed. So that Russia and the Untied States decided just to finish everybody off completely, that they might as well. So they were going to, the U.S. was announcing over its radio that tomorrow they were going to drop 500 trillion, well, the equivalent of 500 trillion tons of TNT on Russia and finish them off, and the Russians would probably do the same to us. And so everybody was in their little fallout shelter, and just sort of waiting for the end. And it was very strange, the way in which things were, because I could sort of observe all these large sections of the country. And then this person, this man that used to be our next door neighbor, Sergio, was talking about how there used to be huge herds of cattle out here on the Texas plains, and the rolling farmland that used to be around and everything. And then I was somewhere out West in this little shelter community. And everybody had their own little shelter, and they were just about the size of houses. And it was one of the most peaceful places to be the last few days just waiting for the end of everything, because there weren't any riots or anything going on like there were most places when people knew they were going to die in just a few days. Except there were some young teenage boys that were going around looting places, for some reason, and they had come toward our little community. And I was out talking to somebody when I was far down the hill, some sort of disturbance going on. And so I grabbed up my children and ran back toward the shelter. And to get in it, you -- well, there were various ways -- it started off being something very complicated about climbing up this ladder to the top of a window and climbing down to the other side and pulling the ladder back up and the window back up. And then it turned into being a sort of sloping ramp that led up to these sliding cedar doors. And so we ran in, and then there were several people that didn't belong to our shelter that were out on the ramp. And these, not too far away this group of teenage boys was coming, and one of them, one of the people that was on our ramp was one of the teenage boys that had been hurt or something. And so we debated for just a minute or so whether to bring these people in, especially the teenage boy, whether he deserved to be brought in. But finally we did bring them in. Some were children and people, and were trying to close the doors of the shelter just as these boys were coming up the ramp. And the doors were very flimsy now, so that these boys could get in real easily. But they just let one person try to break the doors down. So we got a shovel and I hit this boy just enough to make him stop fooling with the door. And so they didn't all try to rush it together or anything; they just went off. And our little hoodlum friend, the one we had brought in, was sort of impressed by the fact that we didn't try to kill anybody and we had brought him in. But then he ran off and went off to join his companions. When I woke up and I was thinking about it, I sort of went back to sleep, and was listening to this radio announcer talking about the weather for the next day, when all these bombs had been dropped. and the moon, it seems, was green, and strange things were done to the colors of the sky and everything, because of all this energy let loose by something, so that different things would take on these unusual colors, especially the sky and the clouds. And this was sort of nice, and some sort of compensation for the fact that we were all going to be killed. There wasn't any particular sense of doom or fear about the dream. It was just sort of an impersonal account. As a matter of fact, I think I wondered in the first part of the dream why there wasn't more sobbing and wailing going on."
"145"	"(01/11/63)"	"The first part of this dream is indistinct, but then I remember that I and a group of people were in front of this tunnel carved into the side of this mountain. A small tunnel, just say 3 or 4 feet high, which led back into the mountain. And a little tiny railroad car of some sort was supposed to go back there. There was also a little wire that ran overhead. And we were going into the mountain, a sort of a sight-seeing tour because there were several things of interest inside it that we would want to see. So we all got into these little baskets which were suspended from this wire that ran along the ceiling, and were carried along, and stopped at one or two places that I don't quite remember. And then we were going to see the zoology and chemistry sections. And we asked this woman how to get there. And she was busy, but finally she opened this door which showed this steep, narrow flight of stairs leading downward, and said that we would go this way. So we started down the stairs, and I was in the lead, and there were innumerable flights of stairs, one after another, going down into this mountain. And we started going faster and faster, and sort of swinging along and jumping over the stairs and going farther and farther down. And finally we came to a level where there was a zoology lab section which was just finishing up. And so we decided we'd ask these people exactly where the exhibits or whatever were. And so we went into the lab. There were people putting up the animals they were dissecting, which were some rather strange sorts of animals. It wasn't a fetal pig, but I guess it was closer to that than to anything. And when we told the instructor what we were looking for, he asked one of the students to show us the dissection he had been doing. And so he opened up this animal, and all the parts inside were just, they had been, it seemed they had been detached and weren't in their proper places, and were just floating around. It really didn't look like what you would see inside an animal at all, and we were talking about this and discussing it, and that's all I remember of the dream."
"146"	"(01/11/63)"	"I had another dream before I woke up, which started off here in the town we live in. And I'd been uptown or something, and I was on my way home, walking. And I came to the house of my friend, Judy, who lives close to us. And I had bought some sort of plant. It was in a flower pot. It had a lampshade on it. And I decided that I didn't want it, that it had bloomed, and it had green leaves, but it wasn't at all an attractive plant. And so she was throwing some sort of plant out also in her back yard, and so I threw mine out there, and then decided there was no point in keeping the flower pot, so I threw that away. And then I was walking home (very dim), it got complicated and involved. These three children had been kidnapped by these men and put in this building, up on the 4th or 5th story. And they were kept in this room so well, that although everybody knew they were in this room, or rather the building, they couldn't find them. And the police and the other people were searching for them. And while they were searching for the children ... they occasionally had this vision or thought they saw this huge woman who sort of seemed to be the ... or the mother figure, who, they'd see her in corridors. It was all a very sort of eerie aspect to the whole thing. And finally, after the children had been found, the appearances stopped. And they decided that it must have been the house itself that somehow was projecting its own personality ... thoughts or emotions about the children to these people who were looking for them."
"147"	"(02/01/63)"	"I dreamed I was in a very large library, and it was set up in the form of a huge rectangular room, with all of the books stored off of this room on different levels. And there was a small restaurant near the end of the library that I was at, with mostly very small booths. And the people who were there were mostly people who had been in the French class I audited last semester. And a bear was going to be let loose in this library, and it was going to be following this father and his little child, his little child being around 3 or 4 years old. And he was supposed to try get away from it. And in the dream for a while I was sort of watching this, and sort of identified with it. The bear actually was never very close to this man and his child he was carrying on his shoulders. But he was running in and out of the little tables there in the restaurant, and generally dodging around thru this immense room in the library. And you could see the bear. It was down at the other end of the library, and it was so far away that it, well, it looked very small, but of course you knew it was an ordinary-sized bear. And then the bear was chasing me. And I decided that a better way to get rid of it would be to go back into the stacks of the library, that there would be more places that you could dodge and hide in there. And there were some sort of tunnels, round-tunnels isn't exactly the word because they went up and down, and they had staircases in them, but they were sort of spiral staircases, only much narrower than usual spiral staircases are -- which went from level to level, and they were for the use of the library staff, and they were completely enclosed, except at the tops of each level. And they were closed, if I remember correctly, at the top, with some sort of a bag or something that you stuffed down into the top after you had gone thru. And so I was going thru, and pulling these bags or whatever, these stuffed bags, into the opening after I got in. And they were very narrow stairs, because it wasn't much bigger around, there wasn't any leeway on either side. But I would go down, and this bear -- even though it was much bigger than I was -- seemed to be able to follow me fairly easily. And there were elevators also that went from level to level, and I thought, well, naturally a bear wouldn't know how to take an elevator, and might go on one of those if I found one. And so I did, and I went down to the 14th level, because I remembered that I needed to look for a certain magazine. I believe I was looking for it for my husband, and I thought it would be found on this level. It also had something to do with the French course that I had been auditing, and so it seems rather hard to see how my husband could have been interested in it. But I started looking for the magazines, and the bear sort of dropped out of the picture entirely. And I was just looking for this particular magazine, which would have been a big one, called the American something, full of all these lush pictures and everything. But I never did find it."
"148"	"(02/03/63)"	"I had a dream that was influenced by a couple of science fiction stories I read the previous night, one about a man who could grow people in his garden, and another about the world after an atomic war when clouds covered the sky and everybody was suspicious of knowledge. So as the dream begins, I'm sitting on this college campus lawn, along with many other people. And I'm in particular talking to one person. Everybody seems to be in little groups, and each group seems to be somewhat suspicious of the others. While we're sitting here, on the far side of the lawn a group of people -- mostly girls -- comes, and along with them is this group of black-coated people that seem to be priests of some kind. And as they start to come in the great quadrangle, they start looking in our direction. And everything in the whole lawn gets deathly quiet while they stare over at us and we stare back at them. And there's this great tension in the air and it seems to be rather dangerous. And what resolves this finally is that this world is like the world in my dream where the clouds cover the sky all the time, and the very unusual event happens that the sun comes out. And so everybody is distracted and starts looking at this. This is supposed to be sort of a sacred event, and apparently everybody was supposed to just watch it, and not do anything while the sun was shining. But a whole group of people got up and left, running off the quad and disappearing. And I got the urge to go also, and somebody else that was with me. It was as if the sun was calling us to come, to follow these people and find out what they were doing. And so we ran off, and several buildings farther on, behind the building, we saw they were running off, and they all were carrying sticks of holly. And I knew that this had some religious significance. And all the, it was a crowd of little boys and little girls mostly, but obviously there must have been somebody else with them, from what happened later. But the little boys were behind this one building, and they had taken off their clothes, and were adorning themselves with this holly. And we went on a little farther and there was -- and I knew that this was what we would find before we got there -- there was a field of corn all ready to be harvested, and lying between the rows of the corn were the little girls. And they had been dressed by some older women, presumably, in the green corn husks and the green corn tassels, and were lying here waiting for the little boys. It was going to be a sort of ritual sexual union that was supposed to have an influence on the sun. And meanwhile, the priests and the other people we knew were very angry and were going to be following us, because this was very pagan from their point of view. Therefore, we had to hurry to initiate this ceremony. And so I went and got one of the little boys - and now he was bound up in corn husks too in some way - and put him down on top of this little girl, and had them join in intercourse. And the little girl said that it hurt, but I said it was necessary. And also the other reason for this haste was the fact that the sun was going back under the clouds. But when they were joined in this way, the sun came back out again, so we knew that it really did have an effect. About this time, the priests came up and were starting to argue with us. And so we showed them that they had been working on the wrong principles all along, that they had been really working just with the powers of darkness, and that this would insure that the powers of light would be with us too, that this was something that was necessary and these rituals were a sort of sympathetic magic to insure that the sun would stay with us. And that both sides of this existence were necessary."
"149"	"(02/19/63)"	"I had a fragment of a dream that was fairly interesting. There was a large cathedral that I was going thru. It was part of a monastery. And the monk in the cathedral pointed to this round stained glass window and wanted to know if it would be alright if he put his own image up there. And I thought it would be. So he caused, just by standing there looking at it or pointing at it or something, the window to -- the design that was on the window -- to disappear, and his face to appear there. And there were two very bright blue eyes on the, in the window. It was still in stained glass style; it wasn't just an exact reproduction of his face. And as we watched these eyes and looked at the window, they got larger. There were round and of a very vivid blue. And they started winking at us. And you could tell both by the -- well, by the very quality of the blue, you could tell that outside it must be a very beautiful day, because of this great light that was coming thru them."
"150"	"(02/19/63)"	"Then I had another dream that started, I was in a bathroom with some strange man, and this boa constrictor about 8 feet long, great big snake. And I was afraid of the man and the snake. There was a bathtub full of water and in the corner of the wall where the bathtub was, there was a little tiny ledge with a little tiny ladder on it. And I had climbed up on this ladder to get as far away from this snake and the man as I could. And they were both in the bathtub. And I didn't know what I could do to keep them from getting me. There was a shelf that I could reach, and it had this heavy little box on it that I threw down into the water, and this upset the man because apparently it had something very valuable in it. And the snake stood up on the end of its tail and tried to knock me off the perch, and I knew I was going to eventually have to come down. Finally I did come down, and I grabbed the snake when it tried to attack me. That was the only way I could get out of the bathroom. And I grabbed it right behind the neck. And I told the man, who seemed to not really be able to do anything to stop me, that I was going to kill the snake; the snake was sort of his brother. And so I pounded the snake's head on the floor until it, until I could hear the skull crack. And then I let go of it. And now it was a man, I believe, sort of crumbled up on the floor. I knew I had to leave. And this man, the real man, was quite wealthy. And I got quite a bit of money from him, and wet out to travel and get away. And I told him rather jokingly that I would meet him on top of the Eiffel Tower, because he was very afraid of heights, and I think this was one reason he hadn't tried to get me himself when I was on the ladder there. And the next thing that took place, I was in the Eiffel Tower, and I was coming down from the top in this sort of rickety elevator that you worked yourself. And I was a man, I believe; yeah, I was a man. And another man came up to me, and wondered if I would like to make a deal. This fabulously wealthy Arabian lady who was getting on in years wanted to pay for someone's young body, which she could take over. And she didn't care whether it was a man's or a woman's. She sort of thought it would be nice to switch to a man's body for a change. And so we talked about this, and then the whole thing sort of disintegrated into an entirely different type of story, about this young man and woman who loved each other and who were being persecuted by this older and very fat man who wanted the girl for himself, and who was this leader of this gang of criminals, against which this couple couldn't do anything. And this story went on for some time..."
"151"	"(02/22/63)"	"I dreamed that I and this man, whom I believe was my husband, were walking thru a series of five corridors. And these corridors were fairly long and narrow. And the walls on either side of them were quite high, I would say at least 15 or 20 feet. And altho there didn't seem to be a roof over these, they were quite dark inside. These were corridors where I had been before, but I hadn't visited in quite a long time. And the floor was dusty, and there was a lot of litter of leaves of strawberry plants and pieces of strawberry plants on the floor, as well as bowls which had had strawberries eaten from them. And we were both barefooted. And as we walked from one corridor to another, you couldn't see, it wasn't a straight line, each corridor was on a little bit lower level than the other, and apparently at some angle to it, so that you couldn't see thru the end door into the next one until you were there. And I made the man walk ahead of me, I was a little bit afraid because there was some danger that there might be snakes lurking among these strawberry leaves. Also strawberry leaves were symbols of the male organ, and I was supposed to give one of these to somebody. We walked thru the five corridors and came into the hall of this building, which was also long and narrow, and had a door on the farther end, and several doors on each side. And there was also an elevator there that we were going to take to somewhere, but this Negro man was guarding it and wouldn't let us take it. So we walked out a side door on the right into this little semi-enclosed courtyard that was roughly triangular in shape. And to get back out of this place, all the exits were guarded, and my husband, or whoever it was that was with me, would have to get past one of these guards without being seen. And this was sort of a game. If he did, we would be free to leave; if he didn't, he would be sent back and have to try again. And so he could either try going back in the building, or the only other way out was, there was this pool, a sort of a semicircular man-made pool at right angles to the building, which was guarded by a couple of boys I had known in high school, twins, I believe. And if you could get thru this pool and get over the little wall on the other side of it, the circular part of it was toward the outside. Then, before these boys saw you - and they weren't paying a whole lot of attention to the pool, they weren't just staring at it - then we would be able to go. And so he was going to try this, my husband was, eventually, when he saw a good opportunity. And that was about the end of that dream. Although you couldn't see from one corridor into another, the impression is still that they were in a straight line, that there was just something funny about the doors from one into the other. And even though you got the impression of going down, from one to the other, it also seemed that they were really on a level, and on a level with the hall, even though there was the impression of going down, and that it got darker as you went from one to another."
"152"	"(03/02/63)"	"I dreamed that I was uptown in a large city that was probably in my dream supposed to be my hometown. And I was shopping. I was single and I was pregnant, and the father of my child was this boy, Landon, whom I used to think was right nice. He used to live next door to us, and was about six years older than me. And he was in the army now, and I wanted him to get married to me, even if it didn't mean anything to him, so that at least the child would have a name, even if he didn't want to stay with me, or anything. And I went in a dime store and was looking around. I didn't have anything particular in mind that I wanted, and yet I felt that there was something that I badly needed to buy. And I looked around. And there were a couple of pick-pockets in the store. These pick-pockets would get things and try to put them in my pocketbook and my pockets and then they were going to pick them up on the way out or else if they got caught, then they were going to claim that I was the one that was guilty. And so I was trying to keep away from these people and at the same time look at things that I really wanted to look at. And one woman in this little dime store came up to me, a clerk, and said that she had heard about me. The other clerks had told her that there was no point in waiting on me because I would never find what it was I was looking for, or that I would never buy anything. And I said yes, that was probably true, because the thing that I really wanted, I knew I could never find it in a dime store, which was apparently a ring. There was something else besides, but the one thing I wanted very badly was to get a man's wedding ring for this boy so that when he came to town, we could get married. And I looked at their little cheap rings, but I naturally didn't like any of them very much. Then I went outside, and there was some sort of a national crisis. War was going to be declared any moment or something, and all these Marines were running around the streets in their uniforms, and looking very haggard as if they'd just come in from a 50-mile hike or something. And I walked down the street in one direction for a while, and then I turned around and came back. The direction I was going in is the direction that in my hometown, if you go in, you come out of the store section of town real quickly and just get into business districts and shops. And so I did come back. And then there were some confusing episodes. And I, and a whole group of people, had been captured by somebody whom I presume were Russians. And they were marching us along, out in the country somewhere, over this great flat plain -- well, it had a general upslope to the right of us. And there were many hills on the right. And far away on the left there were grain fields and then trees. And they were making us go very quickly and they weren't giving us anything to eat. And we started coming into a place where there were blackberries and raspberries growing, in a very strange way. They were very big blackberries and raspberries, and they were growing sort of singly, more like strawberries might grow, close to the ground. And they didn't want us to be able to eat any of these, and they were making us run past them. But we ran real fast and got ahead of them, and were starting to eat some of these, when overhead all these airplanes started appearing. And there were many, many of them, and a sort of strange shape, sort of a butterfly shape, although they only had the normal two wings. And they were small planes, but there were a lot of them and they were high up. And they acted as if they were perhaps going to strafe all these troops that were with us, and that meant, of course, that we would be bombed too. And there was no place to go that one could get away from these. And a few confusing things happened. And then all these airplanes had landed, or a lot of them, up at the top of these hills that were on the right. And we were going up there. And what we saw was, all of the people, the troops, that had gotten out of these airplanes, were all dressed up in these bright band-type uniforms. I think they were very bright red with gold trim, and playing these tunes on these sort of old-fashioned horns, like hunting horns. And the Russian leaders, like Kruschev and everything, were standing there, and nobody was firing a shot at anybody. And I thought, how strange, what do they think they're doing? How do they think they're going to accomplish anything like this? And then Khrushchev had made some sort of promise, and then he was sort of backing down on it, and he wasn't going to keep it. And at once a bunch of the troops that had been around him and not offering any violence got down on their hands and knees and started barking like dogs, and it was just a  whole troop of them chasing him. And he didn't know what to think, he was sort of afraid and then he was sort of astonished, and then he starting laughing. And the troops were acting the way my daughter acts when she acts like a dog. And I thought, well, now we see what is needed, some sort of childlike approach to everything will work out best."
"153"	"(04/13/63)"	"I dreamed that I was with my family, and at least one other person's family, taking a vacation in the mountains. And it seems that we were camping out, and we had just gotten there, and were all settled and everything. We were on the slope, the very steep slope, of the side of the mountain. And I and the other children -- we all seemed to be somewhere in our teens -- wanted to go down the mountain. I and my sister were staying sort of together, and I and my sister wanted to gather some sort of flowers on the way, which some of the other children in the group, especially some of the boys, were trying to keep us from getting. And we were sort of having a race down the side of the mountain, which was very, very steep and very covered with flowers and green things and growing things. And at times as we went down the side of the mountain, going very fast down it, there was, well, there was another slope right beside us, so it was almost as if we were climbing down between two walls, although they were both very green, and there was no sense of being closed in, and also no sense of fear from the steepness. And as we went farther down, it became apparent what we were going down there for was this certain type of clay which could be found at the bottom of the mountain. And we were going to get some so that we could make things out of it. And we came down to some of the houses on some of the lower levels, and little cabins, vacation cabins, some of which had occupants in them, and some of which didn't. And my sister and I, instead of going all the way down the mountain and across the valley to where they actually mined this clay, decided that instead we would visit the cabin of this old man that lived there, who had much of the clay in his cabin dried out to use, because he was a very old man and had lived there for a long time and was very skillful in making things. And also there was enough clay there, if we wanted it there would be no problem, we could take it. So we went in and saw him there, and were going to take some of his dried clay powder back in a bucket. This would be easier to carry because it would be lighter, instead of taking the wet clay from farther down in the valley. We could take the dried powder and add water from the spring that was closer to the camp. And so we talked to him. He was sort of in charge of everything. And he told us that the next morning he was going to get rid of these couple of wasps' nests that had been causing trouble. And he was going to get rid of them at 7 o'clock in the morning, but he'd put a.p. on a little notice he'd put up for anyone who was interested, and it would cause confusion and some people might not come, especially at 7:00am which was sort of early in the morning. And I wanted to ask him, but kept being a little shy, if I could have the grubs from the wasps' nests to go fishing with, because they would be good bait. And we were discussing the wasps a little bit, and then the dream changed a little bit while I was still there. And we were thinking or talking about someone who had had some babies, at least twins. And there was something rather unusual about these babies, and we were discussing this when I woke up."
"154"	"(04/13/63)"	"I dreamed I was sort of reenacting this scene, or was going to reenact this scene, in this obstacle course of Dr. No that John Dunne was telling us about the other day. And I was following him along to where the course would start, and we were going, we were going up the stairs to the library, and starting to go down, when I suddenly realized that I could at least make an attempt to get away in this crowd. And so I started running back away from him, and past this merry-go-round with all these children playing on it and into the building itself, which was now more like a store, with much fewer people here. And I ran and dodged around for a while, and finally I asked this colored man who I thought I knew and had seen before to please help me to hide me somewhere. So he pointed to this little dressing room, which was dark inside. And I went inside, and the minute I was inside, I regretted it before I could even see, and when the door started closing, there, behind it, was Francis Layne, who was also -- now in the dream -- had taken the place of this Dr. No. And I was appalled, and I started to run back out and I knew now that I wasn't going to get away. But I ran down some stairs, into a part of the store that had been closed off for repairs or something, and it was deserted. and it was also on the ground floor, so that I looked at the doors to see if I could get out, but I couldn't. And so I ran on down into the basement, and thru some corridors, and came to this ladies' room in this very deserted-looking place. And I went inside and there was a couple of booths there, and also a table and a chair, and on the chair I saw two legs, each the same size, but dressed in a different style stocking, and there was nobody attached to them, and they started moving. And I looked under the table and there was this sort of square hole in the wall, and these two girls were lying in there, sort of entwined around each other. And I knew that they were lesbians and that they lived there. And they both got up and I was very attracted to one of them. And she stood and was facing me and started rubbing me a little bit, and I liked it very much. And I was going to stay with them. There were a couple of other.... And they were sending one of the girls away for some provisions, to a drug store. And I felt rather badly that I didn't have any money to contribute, but they seemed not to care. They were going to take care of me anyway. And so the girl that I was very attracted to and the other girl went out, and I was with a third girl, one that -- the one that had come in. And we sat there, I guess, and were talking about something, when suddenly I heard these people coming along the corridor, and I knew that it was somebody looking for me. And so I hid behind this chair, and the girl said she would hide me, but the people came in. It was somebody and Francis, I think. And they saw me at once and came over and got me. And that was the end of the dream."
"155"	"(04/15/63)"	"I took a nap in the afternoon, and I had a dream. It started off somewhere on campus, and I was in some building that -- it was a new building and it seemed to be the new language building Day, but it didn't have much resemblance to it and it wasn't in the same place. But I was in there with my daughter, and with this girl who has been in several of my classes before -- in my French classes and in my Dante course this semester. And we were talking while we were walking out of the building. And I was going with my husband -- I'm not exactly sure exactly where we were going, or where we had been. There was something about a car auction, and this whole group of people that had been at this place together were all heading home, starting off together. And we were in this long line of cars, and they were driving very fast and very recklessly, very close to each other. And it seemed very dangerous. And at one point I remember my husband seemed to be passing cars rather recklessly himself. And he decided it was his turn to pass some car in front of us, and a car about two cars behind him pulled out about the time he was getting ready to pass. And he said that wasn't fair, for that car to pull out like that, so he pulled out right in front of it, and sort of ran into the other side of the road. We were going real fast, about 70 or so, and were right in front of this other car, but we got back into the line. And I decided that I would drive for a while because I wouldn't drive that fast. I didn't think it was right. And so I was driving, and the road was sort of narrow and hilly, and there kept being patches of fog on it. All of a sudden would just be this big clump of fog that you couldn't see, and people on both sides o the road were going very fast and driving recklessly. And there was a group of several cars in front of us that seemed to be related in some way, connected in some way, like they were all friends or something that had to get somewhere all together. And one car that was right in front of us all of a sudden went off the road, and went through the fence on the right. And I said that was because they had all been driving too fast and that that whole group eventually something was going to happen to. And we drove on, and all of a sudden, without any warning, came these mountains with these terrific curves, just impossible curves. And it was a very strange narrow little road. It was a very unreal scene, all these narrow, twisting curves and all this fog on the road. I continually couldn't see where I was going and didn't feel like I was controlling the car right. And we went through this mountain, very maze turn of mountain roads for a while and finally came to the end of it. And it was about where I woke up, feeling very drugged from having been asleep in the afternoon, it having been a very hot afternoon. And my husband came home from his meeting with Dr. McCurdy, and brought the car back so I could go to the grocery store. So I had to get up and get my daughter up and go on to the store because it was sort of late in the afternoon, even though I felt dopey, and wasn't real bright and wide awake, and didn't want to drive when I wasn't fully awake. But I did, and I rolled down the window to get lots of fresh air because I felt sort of dazed and in a fog, as it were. And so we were driving to the grocery store and as we got down the highway, about two blocks from where I would turn, all the cars stopped and we had to wait for a while. And when we got up to where the shopping center was, I saw that there had been a sort of big accident, probably not a real serious one. It seemed to have involved about four cars on both sides of the road. And also across from this shopping center is this great bit open field that used to, I don't remember if it still does, have this fence along it, about 100 feet off the road. And for a long time there was a green car that had gone off the road down by the fence. And the car that ran off the road in my dream and went through this fence in a place very similar to what this place actually was, was a green car, sort of an old model. And also I had this dream last night that had just this one element of a car going off a road and through a fence into a field. None of these cars when I saw them were actually off the road, except off to one side of the road, but it was at this place where they were. That's all."
"156"	"(04/16/63)"	"I dreamed that I was driving along in the mountains behind a large truck, and we were coming down out of the mountains into this valley. And the truck gave me a signal to pass him, but I didn't think I could see far enough ahead, so I didn't. And we came to a railroad track which was right in the center of the valley, cutting across it. and off of a sudden a little signal flashed on, and I shouted to the driver of the truck to stop. And we stopped, and this train came up from the left and started to go across, and then another train came up in the opposite direction. And the engineer of the first train got out and told everyone who was waiting in the station to get out of the valley as quickly as they could, because there was something about the strong winds in the meadows, that often trains were wrecked as they tried to cross it. And so we went across the valley and up the other side - it wasn't a very wide valley, with very steep mountains on either side - as quickly as we could. And we were on a flight of stairs about halfway up, and decided to stay there a little while and look back into the valley and see if anything did happen to the train when it crossed the valley. And we (my husband, Bill Gammet, and my daughter was with us), there were a couple of other people there. And Bill and I went up to the top of this tower that was right beside us, but decided that we couldn't see as well from there as we had before, so we went back and looked down. And down at the foot of where we were now was the train station. And the train started to come into it. And something happened. The engine pulled away from the rest of the train, and the train started slowly, very slowly, without any noise, to crumple up. And it was sort of horrible and sort of not. It was most horrible because it was a passenger train. And yet there was -- well, not this air of unreality -- about it, but although I thought I should be very horrified by it, I wasn't. So I said that we should go down and help these people. And I went down. And besides the people in the train, there didn't seem to be too many people outside interested in what was going on. A couple of men were carrying a couple of bodies by. And I went inside. And the people who were sitting around the counters and at the booths at this little lunch counter were saying that they wouldn't move, but I told them very commandingly that if they didn't stay and help all these people who were sick -- who were hurt in this accident -- they could leave at once. And so they all got up and left. And I told the waitresses behind the counter to start fixing lots of hot water, and I started fixing the tables and everything for the doctors to put patients down on to see. And there weren't any doctors around. And I asked my sister to call some from the phone book. And she called a couple, but there seemed to be difficulty in getting any doctors to come. And I went out to the train, after a little while. And another train was going by this wrecked one, which, incidentally, all the shades were down over the window and you couldn't see in, and there was no noise from inside. But there were these two little boys that looked like twins sitting down inside the windowsill of the end car. And they waved at the train that passed. And I went down and they seemed to be very cheerful and asked them if they had been in the train wreck. And I asked them if they were hurt and they said yes, they were. And one little boy unzipped his jacket and he had this long pink plastic or iron thing, sort of like a knitting needle, stuck through part of his belly, and the other little boy had a similar thing in his arm. and I told them to not bother those things and leave them there til the doctor could look at them. And I went back inside and I thought, there's nothing I can do until the doctor gets here, because, except perhaps get somebody to move the people who were obviously dead out of the train, because I knew you shouldn't move people who had been injured until you knew the extent of their injuries. And at this point I began to wake up. But something told me that this was my problem, I should solve it. And I in some ways had caused this, or there was something of significance in it for me. And so I tried to stay asleep and figure out some way to handle this great catastrophe, but I couldn't seem to figure out a way. That was all."
"157"	"(04/17/63)"	"I had a dream, most of which doesn't seem particularly important, concerning preparations that I and several other people were making for a picnic that we were going to have. But this woman who at first seemed to be part of our group, and who, later it turned out was a Martian, was trying to kill us all, and had very unusual powers, and we couldn't seem to cope with her. And so I particularly was very frightened in the dream. But finally in the dream I said to myself that this dream couldn't go on like this. I couldn't go on being afraid of this person and never being able to succeed against her. And so I decided that something was going to have to be done, something would have to work out. And so she came out, and I grabbed some milk from the table and threw it toward her. And this seemed to have been the right thing to do, because on Mars liquids -- water especially -- being so scarce, were sort of poisons to her, and so sort of burned her. And so then I got water and threw it on her. And this was the solution, because after that I knew I could take care of her and she wouldn't be a menace any more. And this seemed sort of important because last night we were talking with Bill H. and Ruth about dreams and being able to manipulate them, and I said that even if I became aware of dreaming, I was never able to manipulate them. And so I seem to have had a dream in which I proved that I could do this. That's all."
"158"	"(05/05/63)"	"I had several fragments of dreams that seemed sort of interesting. In the first dream, Bill H. had just finished giving me a test of some sort. It wasn't very much like the Rorschach he actually gave me last night, because it consisted of seeing or talking about all these real little people and things. But after we had finished with the test, or as the very last part of the test, he was taking a shower and I was supposed to watch him and then take one myself, or sort of take one with him. And this seemed significant when I woke up from it."
"159"	"(05/05/63)"	"Then there was another dream which I just can remember a fragment, in which I was in a cafeteria, and had gotten a cup of coffee, and was going to pay for it at the cashier's. But she wasn't there. The cafeteria hadn't been open for very long, and there was a group of women seated close to the cash register who might have possibly been waitresses, or who might have been nurses or something, because they seemed to have on some sort of uniforms. And the drawer of the cash register was open, and so I thought, well, I'll just pay for it, since the cashier isn't here. And so I took a quarter out, and left it on the cash register, and got four nickels change. And this seemed sort of, well, sort of an unusual thing for me to do, and it seemed to be related to a dream I had yesterday in which I was giving a speech before a whole group of students about parapsychology and something, which was sort of a more independent sort of thing for me to do than I usually do. That's about all."
"160"	"(05/06/63)"	"I dreamed there was this girl, and sometimes it was me and sometimes it was another girl, who'd been hired by my father to count how many trucks of this company (it was the Lion Co.) came into this city along this certain road. And this was because they wanted part of his business, but all of the other trucking firms already had all the business or most of it. And she was hired to live in this very, very fancy penthouse, it was sort of her pay for the job. And she would sit there, with a pair of binoculars, and count the trucks. But then there were these people - it was very sort of science-fiction story-like - who were going to take over the city, and then take over the world. And they had done something in the city, so almost everybody was dead or not there any more, but I and another girl who later turned out to be my sister , and my husband were there. And we were in this big apartment house. And a car stopped in front of it. They were going to come in and search for us. And so we were trying to hide. And I looked around for all sorts of places for us to hide, mainly for me and Barbara, and I was looking for a place for my sister first, and then I was going to hide. And finally my sister decided that in this big closet, sort of one of these dressing room types of closets, very large, that she was going to hide. And she had covered herself partly with boxes and partly with a blanket. But she refused to keep her face covered, because it bothered her. And yet I said that she had to, or these people would find her. And finally I -- after trying to persuade her -- I had to quit and run and hide myself, behind some clothes over in back of the closet, because I could hear these people outside. And they came in and found us both, and had also found my husband wherever he was, and were going to take us away. And we all threw away our I.D. cards because they marked us as being part of the nobility and everybody who belonged to the nobility was going to be killed. And they were going to take us to a prison camp somewhere, but we knew that we would maybe have another chance to get away. And so then it was I and these two other girls. And we were trying to get away from this place that looked like a girl's school. And a bell had rung and everybody was supposed to come back, but we went on and were out near this woods. And some girls that were near there told us not to go down there, because nobody that went down there could ever find their way out. But we knew that was just what we wanted, because we wanted to get away. And so we ran down into the woods. And we hadn't gone very far until we saw my husband lying on the ground with this picnic basket with him. And this seemed sort of innocuous, but we knew -- since he was now on the enemy side -- that he was there to prevent our escaping. And yet it didn't concern me too much because I was very happy to see him, and felt very tender toward him. And I went up to him, and where he was, and lay down and embraced him, and said how sad it was that we were on opposite sides, and supposed to be enemies. And so we were going to stay there with him, and that was about the end of that dream."
"161"	"(05/09/63)"	"I had two interesting dreams. In the first one, I and my husband were out in the yard. There were several other people out there too. And I happened to be looking up in the sky, and I saw two what seemed to be stars rising up into the air through the clouds. And one seemed to be following the other and chasing it. And I realized that these were really two planes or two rockets or something. And the one which was following the other one got in front of it somehow, and then there was this flash of something that looked like lightning between the two. And one of them, then there was this huge, bright explosion. And I knew it was an atom bomb, and that probably this had been a Russian airplane and one of ours. And so I grabbed my husband and told him to quick, run inside the house. And we did. And then after the shock wave and everything had passed, there wasn't any visible damage around. But we knew there was radiation outside. And several other people came in with us. And the rest of this dream, which seemed to occupy hours and hours, was spent in trying to close up the windows, block them off with things so that some less radiation would get in. And this gave me a very warm and cozy feeling, to be making everything so tight and sealed off and everything. And that was really about all of that dream. "
"162"	"(05/09/63)"	"In the next dream, I was sort of observing a story. It took place out on the desert, and two people were trying to get rid of these two other people, and primarily this one person, by getting rid of their water supply, and also by harming this vulture which followed the two people who were walking along on the desert everywhere. And the two people who were trying to harm the other two were, I don't know what they were doing, following them along in an airplane or something, but they weren't walking along on the desert. But I joined the two people who were on the desert, and walked along with them, and we tried to think of some way to escape. And we came to a big building, and there were two ways that we could go. And we all of a sudden ran and went in the door at the bottom of this building, hoping that these other two people wouldn't see us, but they did. And we had a little bit of water with us, and we were trying to conserve it, but at the same time we decided that we would go up the stairs very fast and maybe lose these people who were following us. And so we did, and there were twelve levels to this building. And we got to the 11th level, and as you went up, there was less and less actual building and more sort of this terrace that was built around it. And the 11th story, about half of it was this terrace, and the 12th story, which was the top, was all terrace, and some sort of military establishment or camp or something, although there was nothing there but this big open space with some grass planted around it, glassed off and wired off from the big drop down to the ground. And I didn't much want to go to either of these stories, but finally I did. And there were these other people there, and I realized that I was going to eventually have to fight with the leader of the group, which was also something I didn't want to do, and especially there since it seemed dangerous. And wire, barbed wire, was strung around the outside of this terrace on all sides, overhead, about 20 feet off the ground, poles or something stretching across and around the terrace were these very high tension wires. And as you watched them, you could see the electricity leaking off them, this artificial lightning crackling across the top of the terrace. And I thought that this would be a very beautiful place if it weren't so dangerous. And I was up there for a little while, and then I had to go back down to change into pajamas. And then I was going to fight this person. And I was hoping to put it off as long as possible. I went down to about the 9th level, I believe. This was where my family lived. And I went into one room and my brother was there, my older brother. And I had my pajamas with me and so I just undressed in front of him and put them on, and this didn't seem to be too unusual or too shocking in the dream. And then we started singing this Easter hymn. And that was about the end of that dream. But I thought it was interesting because of all the various levels and everything."
"163"	"(05/10/63)"	"I dreamed I was in the French building on campus, the language building, and I was going to take some sort of exam that afternoon. And so I went down to some food vending machines that were there to get a bar of candy or something before I went back and studied. And after I had gotten the candy bar, I noticed there was some sort of commotion going on outside the building. I went to the front and looked out, and I saw these people looking, gazing over toward the Bell Tower, in the direction of it. And I saw that there had been a violent windstorm of some sort, probably a tornado, which had caused even the great big water tower (which you could see from where I was, but actually in reality you couldn't) to fall over. And this was very amazing. The whole thing had just toppled over, on its side, or almost on its side. And I went outside. This windstorm had cut sort of a diagonal through campus. There wasn't actually too much damage, except this great, tremendous water tower being overturned. And I went down to a building that was under construction, which would have been, as I was facing the Bell Tower, to the left of the library and about in the parking lot there. But this seemed to be an uptown sort of business district of some sort. And I was standing inside this building, which was unfinished on the inside, just a dirt floor, talking to somebody about the difference between tornadoes and hurricanes. And all of a sudden another little tornado came along. And we were both scared and hid behind this car that was in the building. And the little tornado came in where we were; it was only about 10 or 12 feet high and 4 or 5 inches thick, and it was just a little black round, not even funnel-shaped, with an irregular column. And I remembered something somebody had said one time about if a tornado started heading in one direction, if you headed in an opposite direction, you would probably be safe. And so it went one way and I went another, and got away from it. I wasn't particularly scared of it. I knew if it touched me, it would be pretty bad. And that was about the end of the dream. And I feel this might be significant in some way because I had in the past dreams about tornadoes in which there were great, huge and very terrifying things that were very destructive and very fear-inspiring. I can remember one in particular in which I was in a great building in a city when at the edge of the city across the skyline I could see three huge tornadoes starting to come towards me, and this was a very nightmarish dream. But this one wasn't particularly scary. The tornado was so much smaller. That's all."
"164"	"(05/27/63)"	"I dreamed that I and my sister and my husband and Jimmy Scott were in a building which I believe was the Liberty Life Building in my hometown. And my sister and I had gone with my husband and Jimmy there because they had some sort of business to do which would just take them a little while. It was after 5:00, but they had some sort of business that they figured would just take a few minutes to do. So we were waiting for them, and sitting in a small sort of lounge somewhere. And Jimmy and I and my sister were in there, and my husband was still somewhere. And we were starting to get impatient when my husband came in with this very striking woman. And he introduced us to the beautiful business manager from South America. Apparently they'd been working with her. And this sort of upset me. I was partly jealous and partly the fact that I hadn't realized they were so involved with what they were doing. In other words, I thought they'd just come to pick up a couple of papers or something and we were going to go. And this woman also was very -- not antagonistic -- but just sort of superior, and wouldn't talk to us, which also upset me and made me mad and made me unhappy. But we sat there for a while. There was another woman, a secretary of some sort, that was also there, and she also didn't seem to pay much attention to me. And I knew Jimmy was noticing the way I was acting and this made me feel sort of bad, but I didn't much care. And finally, I was with Jimmy and he was showing me some machines that they had, machines for sort of automatic slide preparation, and I was sort of fascinated with those. And I was sitting on this little ledge, or edge of something, watching this machine work, and then he turned into Paul Obrt. And he was standing there, and put his legs between mine and this was very sexy. And my husband came in, and I was sort of happy that he'd seen this, because I felt it sort of avenged me in some way for these women. And then something happened, and my husband had gone with these woman down to the coffee shop in the building to get them some supper. And after sitting there for a while, I decided I would go to the ladies' room, which was on the 15th floor of the building, as I remembered it. So I walked down to the elevator and got on it - it was an automatic elevator -  and pushed the button for the 15th floor. And the elevator started going up, and the doors started trying to open. And it was as if some malignant force were at work trying to open the doors. And I got back into the back of the elevator and held on to the little rail that runs along the side and shouted at the force to stop. And I had some sort of metal bar that I was hitting at the doors with to try to make them stop. But they kept half-opening and finally opened up all the way, in front of a platform which was all open. There were no walls or anything around it, but I thought I'd better get out before something else happened to the elevator. So I got out, and when I did, it was the 15th floor as I had seen going to, and I went down the hall to find the ladies' room. And all of a sudden this big, burly gorilla sort of man came from somewhere, and he'd been the one, he'd had something to do with the elevator doors opening. And he started chasing me, he was very dangerous, cause he wanted to kill me. And so I started to run down the stairs, I think this would be better than trying to get back to the elevator. And he was running after me; he was much faster. And then suddenly it was very strange because he got in front of me and was running down, and I was running down after him. And I thought, why am I chasing him, since he's in front of me for some reason? Let him run on down. I'll stay up here or something and find some other way to get down. But he was chasing me somehow again, and I was real afraid. And there was some sort of magical powers that we both had, but mine weren't any use against his, because he was too big and powerful. But at last I got, not away from him, but at least back down to the first floor where there were other people, and ran into the lounge where I had been, because I knew that it was useless to scream up on the top of the 15th floor where nobody else was, and that nobody knew where I had gone because I'd thought of telling somebody, but I hadn't; I'd just gone. But at any rate, I got back to the first floor and into this lounge, and there was this girl sitting there, a young girl about my age, who was a witch and had a lot of powers. And I asked her to please help me, and I ran over and I sort of buried my face between her breasts and asked her to please help me and that I would do anything she wanted if she would. And I thought to myself that she was very attractive and I was attracted to her sexually, and just wanted to stay there with her anyhow. And so she did get rid of this person. She said a spell that made all of his fingers fall off; and he had shrunk to this very little person anyhow, still like a man, but about the size of a little child. And so I was going to stay with this girl, and that was about the end of the dream."
"165"	"(05/27/63)"	"I dreamed that I and my husband were going to take a little vacation trip to the Rockies. And this was at the beginning of the summer, and we thought it would be sort of nice to have gone there, since we'd never been there before and since we were going to have to make the trip later in the summer when we went to California. And we started out in the middle of the country somehow, and sort of followed this map-like road so that it was hardly any time at all until we came to the Rockies, which were in the dream this high, sheer cliff rising out of the plain of the map. And there was this very narrow V-shaped cleft between the two sheer walls, through which we went and found ourselves at the entrance to Calumet farm in Kentucky, which is where they raise all sorts of thoroughbred horses. And this didn't seem strange to us in the dream. I said, ""Let's go see it, since we're here."" So we went up and were talking to some people. We had a camera with us, and a lady was explaining to my husband how to set it to take a certain couple of pictures, because if he didn't set it just right, it wouldn't come out. And she showed us some examples of ones that hadn't come out. And my husband got very indignant with her for some reason, and I thought he should have thanked her, and I was angry with him for not having thanked her when I thought he should have. And so we went in through these big doors into the farm itself, and there really wasn't much to see. We were wandering around in a very big room, sort of a library, and found a map that had several tours indicated on it. And my husband decided that we would have to go on all of these. They weren't really tours, they were just sort of paths that we marked out on various places on the farm. And several of these paths led through this large garden which was quite far away from where we were, down this dirt road. But we had to go see it, my husband said. So we started off. At first we were with a couple of other people. And we noticed that there were all sorts of flowers planted along the left side of the road as we were going down it, and all of the flowers were facing back towards the main house. And we knew that there was some sort of trouble there. And it gradually evolved that I was supposed to help them with it, and I would probably get killed in the process. But I was supposed to go down to the greenhouse and do something there. So I went down and I was all by myself at this point, and very scared, but I came to the greenhouse and was sitting at a table with some people when one of the plant people, who had been created by the people at this farm to help them, and who had rebelled, came out. And at first I thought he was going to kill me because I didn't have a Bible. But I got one from somebody and so it was alright. And I don't know exactly what I was supposed to do to save these people. But I was supposed to go in there and try to persuade these plants or whatever not to rebel. And this was about the end of the dream. The plant person, when he came out, acted very haughtily toward us and kicked at people and broke windows and things. That was about all."
"166"	"(02/21/64)"	"""My sister had gotten a divorce and came to stay with us. My husband was having intercourse with her. I was real unhappy about it. I was out in the kitchen fixing breakfast and I could hear them in there in my daughter's room, and I could hear my sister crying because she couldn't have an orgasm. When my husband came out, I got real emotional and started crying, and he and my sister tried to comfort me, and I kept screaming at her to leave. And I thought to myself while I was crying and carrying on that I was really making a bigger scene than I felt like making. He said if I was going to make such an emotional scene about it, that he were just going to leave. And he walked out. While I was sitting out in the kitchen, I was thinking that my sister was going to start doing her share of things around here, washing the dishes and cleaning the house. After he walked out, I lay in my room crying and wondering what she was doing, because I couldn't hear her in there. Finally she came in the room and I told her I was sorry that I was making such a fuss, but I couldn't help it. And that he was my husband and I loved him, and it wasn't fair, it wasn't fair, I kept telling her. We were lying on the bed. And when I turned and looked at her when I was going to divulge my great secret to her, my clincher, it was Arlene M. that I was looking at (although in the dream this didn't register). Then I was going to tell her that besides, my husband could hardly satisfy me, so how did she think he was going to be able to satisfy both of us? But we got involved with getting my brother out of the room, and then I was going to look for my husband, and didn't get a chance to tell her. "
"167"	"(03/20/64)"	"I dreamed one of my women friends had a friend who sexually assaulted young children or something of the sort. We were discussing whether we should let this friend come near our children. As we talked, I could see, on this large green meadow, several as if reconstructions of times this person had actually been with our children. I could also see, near the meadow, a long row of motels where this person had stayed, a different one on each occasion. There was also some importance to the number five, as if he stayed in room 5 or in every fifth motel or something. The dream gradually became more and more nightmarish, not in a scary sense, but that something was quite disturbing about all of these, a sort of feverishness. Finally I woke up, very gradually  and still haunted by the vision of this meadow and motels. At last I realized that I had been bitten several times around the arms and back and neck by a flea and that this was bothering me. I went into the bathroom and turned on the light to see the bites and to maybe find the flea. I saw that I had been bitten five times."
"168"	"(07/16/64)"	"I dreamed I was going with my parents and my husband to see a statue we had heard of in the De Young  Museum -- the ""House of the Friendly Doors."" The museum was closed, but the guide told us where the statue was, and accompanied us to see it and tell us about it, as otherwise it wouldn't be understandable. The statue was of a seated man with a woman on his knee, and another man standing, all dressed in colonial style. The guide told us that this scene represented the first act of prostitution in America, when one a Dutchman had traded some of his goods for this woman's services. He proceeded to give us a long description of what had occurred, which at first was heard, then as if a movie, then I was in it. Although I would have thought that this would be a very quick and impersonal act, it actually became very long and more and more tender, and I was happy because the woman -- who was me by that time -- wasn't simply being used, but was being appreciated for her whole self (the man was reading notes on what to do next from a sort of script outline based on the original occurrence). It was very sexy and tender."
"169"	"(07/16/64)"	"I was standing at the window looking out toward the City with my daughter, and saw a flaming thing fall toward it. Sure enough, it as a bomb, and a great ball of fire rose up into the clouds. I ran with my daughter into a closet, which made her mad and she cried because she didn't understand what was happening. In a few minutes some of the leaves on the tree outside started to catch fire, a strange sort of orange-yellow glow that spread over the leaf like a growth of some sort. Then rain started falling and put out the fire. Wind was blowing. We came out of the closet and we found my husband and brother. We discussed what to do, and decided we must as soon as possible get to an air-raid shelter, though we didn't know where one would be (we lived in a strange neighborhood, in some sort of apartment). So I started collecting clothes and sort of essential items we might need, and almost all of the rest of the dream was involved with this, which got more and more detailed, and also very soothing. Just as we had almost everything we needed, our friend Diane came in with Eric. She was unhappy and didn't seem to know quite what to do, and I was a little afraid that she wouldn't have anything of the things she needed and I would have to give her some of my things. But she was glad that Bob hadn't been here this weekend, but had gone home to study with his mother, though she was upset and wondering how she would ever see him again. Still later I was reviewing the above dream in my mind and it developed another ending. The morning after the bomb fell, I was looking out toward the City -- it was remarkably clear all up the coast -- and I could even see people gathered on the edge of the bay. As I looked, I saw them slowly, without any fuss, walk out into the water and go under. The whole town seemed to be in such a process of calm suicide, and I thought it was both beautiful and sad. But it seemed to be spreading southward toward us, and I was on the beach with someone (my husband and my daughter and my son), watching people go into the water. It was so calm and blue and lovely, and the sand was so clean and nice, and I didn't want to die. But I also knew that these people were right in that the world would be a very different and hard place to live in, even if you survived the effects of the bomb. That was all."
"170"	"(07/17/64)"	"A fragment. I was going with Bob Lieb somewhere on a trip, quite chastely, unfortunately. I think I kept trying to seduce him and he was completely unresponsive-like, rubbing my nipples against his chest as we slept naked together. At one motel where we stayed for several days, I tried to get the lady owner to come down in the price she charged us, telling her a real sob story which even made me cry as I told it. She said she could have charged us a lot less, but she wouldn't change the bill. Also in this dream my friend Diane said she was 19, and I didn't know whether to believe her or not, but I said that was more likely sounding to me, since she seemed so immature."
"171"	"(07/17/64)"	"In another dream, I was with Janet Evans and we were discussing old times and what had happened to people we knew. Mary Lee was in an institution again, Jeanette had gotten divorced from Bill, married one of the Smith twins, and then married Bill again. Janet was unhappy, leading sort of a dull, childless existence. I thought I was very happy and very lucky in the circumstances that I had gotten away from all of this."
"172"	"(07/17/64)"	"I was in Russia, talking to a group of lean, ill-clothed workers in a big, barn-like factory. They were childishly eager to revolt if I could show them how -- we broke the ladders they had (this would somehow upset the guards) and stole a rifle, and shot several guards. Then I left to go to a big gathering, country dance type of thing, being held that night, because it would be suspicious if I didn't show up. By this time someone had helped me make a blunderbuss, which you loaded by pouring a lot of powder into the end, then a sort of cork with a fuse leading from it, then the bullet. You lit the fuse and it fired. But I had to hide this suspicious object since no one was allowed to have guns, and I finally hid it in one of the rich farmer's closets as we walked along (we walked on a dirt road alongside a row of closets). At the party I realized I would have to leave early to get the gun and hide it somewhere more concealed. I went with this old man to a beach park to see if this would be a good place. It seemed to be, so I went back and was going to ask Bob Lieb to take me there to hide it. I was happy that I had found a good excuse for asking him to go somewhere with me."
"173"	"(07/19/64)"	"I was in another city, in some sort of complicated spectator-participant dream. Some teenage girls were mixing themselves a drink on a school lawn. A teacher found them and took them to the principal, who was relieved when he found they hadn't been giving any hard liquor to their young baby brother; he was afraid someone immature might have been getting it. Then someone was trying to rent an apartment down the street. The chief of police wanted to keep him out, but if he were going to pay the rent, there was no way to do so. He wanted to start some sort of a sex magazine to appeal to (how could this be?) lower class Negroes and upper class whites. He was a sort of skinny foreign guy from the South, and he had recruited a bunch of young teenage girls to work for him. They would write stories and then he would end them -- he had written lots of science fiction and fantasy magazines and had all sorts of varied science background. So the girls were arriving and were finding rooms to rent next door to the office he had rented. I was one (at the same time it was also to be a novel or movie in itself -- what would happen to these 5 young girls in the big city, and how would each of them react to confronting life in the raw in N.Y.), and I was sort of this man's press secretary or something, and I went with him to a sort of conference where Pierre Salinger also was. My first assignment was to be to buy five weird types of cars, which were very different from ordinary cars in some way, for him to use the parts for something. We were also talking about the South, and this man considered himself an expert in some way because he had lived there for a while. I said I also considered myself something of an expert, trying partly to impress Pierre."
"174"	"(07/19/64)"	"I was walking up some stairs to an apartment with some Negro man, walking right behind him, and I started singing Number Twelve Train. He started accompanying it and also rubbing me, and it was very nice and close and only mildly sexy. I wanted to know him better and probably to have an affair with him also."
"175"	"(07/21/64)"	"I had one dream about meeting Lil, but there was really nothing much to it. We went to their house, which was modern and on a large secluded sort of lot. Her husband reminded me somewhat of Engstrom. She was dark-haired, thinnish, and dressed in slacks, sort of quiet. She had a sort of study off from the kitchen. When we went in it, we looked out the windows. I thought I saw several people wandering around in her back yard. I pointed it out to her, and she said it was just our reflections in the window. This was hard to believe because they looked so different, but finally I saw that it was."
"176"	"(07/21/64)"	"We were going camping  in the mountains. We had passed a lake and were on our way to the next campground. We came to a lake right next to a big army post, all surrounded by a high wire fence. This was the campground. The ranger told us we would have to carry our stuff in, as no cars were allowed, and we would have a specified campsite the first night. There was about 10 feet between the fence and the water. The lake was warm, and they had several lifeguards, and I thought we'd go swimming."
"177"	"(07/21/64)"	"I was in some sort of orchestral-vocal production, and we were rehearsing. All the voice parts were going to have to sing separately so the director could hear them and criticize. We first sang some song which isn't actually Green Grow the Rushes, but which had the same tune and refrain, ""one is one...."" But in the dream I didn't know the song and sort of goofed when I sang it alone. But I was proud of myself for singing in front of all those people anyway. Then Karen Lucas sang, and instead of singing the song we were supposed to, she sang some esoteric folksong which made the director very happy. Another girl sang and then it was time to go, and I sang a song I knew loudly so he would hear and know that I could sing if it was a song I knew. On the way home I was walking with someone, very like my husband. It was in the city, I was unmarried, and had a sort of deformity, a twisted leg or something (the one that's been hurting me since camping). but he had his arm around me. Another girl came up, a sort of loose type, and started flirting with him. He was very nice to her. She asked him to a party as if I wasn't there. He said he would come if he could bring me. She made some very insulting remark about me, but he said she was wrong to say things like that and that we both would be coming to her party. I didn't want to go after being insulted like that, but I was happy he wanted to be with me."
"178"	"(07/22/64)"	"I was swimming with Barney, Mike, my husband and indeterminate other people in a big lake. Barney and some other people had these dark blue surf-type things with motors which they were riding. Barney was having all sorts of difficulty with his, and seemed to be drowning. So someone got him and carried him into the first aid station, which was in the lodge by the lake. Mike and I went after them. We were in bathing suits (my bikini) and caused a sort of sensation in the staid dining rooms we were going through. I felt a little awkward to be going to see Barney since I really hardly knew him, but I wanted to go. He seemed happy to see me. Mike left after a few minutes, and Barney said he would like for me to stay, so I did. I was holding his head in my lap, and one of my breasts was partly out of my swimming suit. He kissed it and said it was a sweet spot. I was sexy and tender and also surprised at how I was doing this very unusual thing for me of acting, not really particularly forward, but just the way I felt like acting, and that I wasn't being rebuffed. "
"179"	"(07/22/65)"	"Also a complicated dream about Bob and my husband shooting arrows at ,u friend Diane and I, and how the chi-square distribution of their shots was different, My husband's evenly, and Bob's all in the first and fourth cells."
"180"	"(07/23/64)"	"I was on a highway, walking  and turned off onto a ramp leading up. Very steep, with a large pipe running down the center of it and steps sort of underneath that were to walk on. A car couldn't really have gone on this road. I climbed up, and I knew I had climbed it before, and had, in fact, been through the whole sequence of things which will follow, although under somewhat different circumstances with a different, but unremembered, outcome. When I reached the top, I had to climb down a short, steep part to an overhang which led into this department store which I was to enter and do something there. All the people would be on the lookout for me, as I had done this sort of thing before (though some of the clerks, etc., would be sympathetic to me). I got someone to help me into the store, but another person saw me and there was an alarm. This was the basement and everyone assumed I would run up to the first floor and try to escape at once, so I would be easily caught. But I took the elevator to the 4th floor where it was calm, quiet, darkish, very plush and rich. Reddish-purple carpets and walls, a quiet beauty salon (I considered having my hair dyed, but decided against it), and mazy halls which angled and turned in the half-light. I looked for stairs rather than elevators to take, and finally found a flight, and went down to the 3rd floor. Here it was lighter and more open, gray-white and gold, with works of art hanging around (the basement was shipping and clerks and bookkeeping, crowded and cut-up and harsh artificial light). Several well-dressed women were strolling around looking at the works of art. I had to hide behind a screen while an authoritative woman dressed in black came toward where I was. A bunch of ""plainclothesmen"" were looking for me, all dressed in all sorts of weird plain clothes, very obvious. I strolled around trying to be inconspicuous. Someone seemed to be coming toward me, and I walked out onto the balcony. A man was there, and we both looked at the sunset. (This, somehow, was the 55th floor, though the old hotel had had only 5 floors.) This young man and I were completely enraptured by the beauty of the sunset, which was immense over a plain, with golden and green trees flooded with light caught in the golden rays of the sun, bright rayed clouds above them, pink and gold, darkish blue sky. We agreed that it was criminal to spoil scenery like this (though in reality there wasn't much scenery, several buildings and industrial type things, but mostly empty plain). Now everyone was out on the balcony, lining up to be counted. If there were an extra person, then they would know I was there. They had missed one person, who was hiding so I wouldn't be caught, but someone else turned him in and he was led off. They ignored me, which now seems strange."
"181"	"(07/25/64)"	"In one dream I was in some sort of a tuberculosis hospital being cured. They were very strict and also sort of stingy, as with their food (it was also a sort of Lexington for addicts). I didn't understand exactly how I'd gotten into the place, but it was going to be hard to get out now that I was in. "
"182"	"(07/25/64)"	"I can remember the dream involved levels, going up and down ramps, stairs, hills. Once we were looking for a certain road turnoff, with my husband and my daughter and mother. We were walking up a hill on a large road, with all sorts of roads crossing overhead, and it was raining. I spotted the turnoff, and knew I was right, because I had taken it before, and mother backed me up, though my husband thought it was wrong."
"183"	"(07/25/64)"	"My husband and I were in a cafeteria (food is a big motif in these dreams too, it was in the one about the hospital, where I wasn't getting enough), and I was before him in the line. I went off looking for a table for us (we knew several other people there, like Bob) but were afraid that they wouldn't want to eat with us. I had to go up stairs to find a place, but my husband didn't follow, so I had to go back to find him. This led into another thing with Bob, where the three of us were going up and down stairs, through a couple of nightclubs on our way up and down, back and forth, looking for some indeterminate thing. It was all sort of sordid and dirty, and I was afraid my daugher would get dirty from walking up and down these stairs with us. Bob was evading going to some class, or had, and was telling us how he managed it, and with what sort of slim excuse he rationalized to himself that he shouldn't go."
"184"	"(07/26/64)"	"Bob and Diane and we were discussing our experiences coming across the country. They had had some bad experience in Siskiyo, Illinois. I was in it as they told it, and we were going through it and I said, ""We went through this town too."" Bob and Diane and some other people (both boys?) were in the MG, which had the back let down like a platform for the two others. Bob pulled into a gas station and asked for regular. The attendant said it would run better on premium, and in spite of Bob's protests, he put premium into the car. Bob got into an argument with him, refusing to pay for anything but the equivalent amount of regular; everybody joined in, arguing and telling Bob how he should handle the situation. The manager of the gas station dared Bob to try to get away with this, to see the cop on the corner with whom he had a deal. Bob couldn't believe this; he said he would, believing the police would surely not allow him to be cheated in this way. So he drove out of the gas station and headed east. It was night and soon we were out of the town, without having seen the police. We realized we were going in the wrong direction, so turned. but the police caught us and made us pay the amount for the gas. (Ever since turning, we were in the MG.) Now we drove on, and soon came to a river where people were picnicking (Sunday afternoon). Bob was intrigued, and though we thought we were driving by, we soon came to the gate to the park, which was now an ocean park. As long as we were there, we thought we might as well stop and have our first look at the Pacific. It was warm and nice in the sun (is it here or later in this dream or another that my bra keeps falling off? The straps come loose and my breasts are bare). I want to go down and see the waves. They are huge and very powerful, and charge up the sand and over dunes and rocks maybe a hundred feet before they stop. I run back from the first one, but get caught by it, so lie down and hold on to the sloping rocks of the cliff (they go up like stairs). The wave washes over me. When it is past, I get up and climb a little further; another one comes. I am both frightened and exhilarated by having the cool water rush over me. This was about it, I think. We got back in the car and left."
"185"	"(07/26/64)"	"Another dream. I and Bob are standing on a hill overlooking the ocean. By the ocean is a red barn and an old red farmhouse, which Bob says had been his home when he was young. As we watch, suddenly enormous waves, taller than the house, break over it and destroy it, becoming larger and larger. Though we are miles from the sea, we can hear its roar. I suddenly realize that we are in danger even where we are, so we begin to run up the hill. I think that there has been a terrific series of earthquakes and that probably this is the end of the world. As we run, it becomes my husband and I. We get onto a platform on a slow-moving passenger train that is going away from the ocean. For months we ride. At last the train stops. The effects are over. We are in the middle of the country somewhere, and must start picking up the pieces and making a new life from the chaos. The people on the train are a mixed bunch. We realize we will have to share each other sexually; this doesn't seem to be too big an issue in the dream. But there is an event: a movie or something in a little town we are near and eventually will move to."
"186"	"(07/26/64)"	"My husband is going to take me and another girl to this big night on the town with hamburgers at some little place and a movie. The other girl turns out to be Negro. I am upset, but try to be nice. It turns out as we are leaving that she doesn't have any shoes on, so I go to try to find some for her. As I look for some, she seems to become more ragged and poverty-stricken (at first she had on a quite fancy evening gown). I look for clothes for her too (she also becomes younger and younger). Somehow we never go. Then it is a day, we are going into town. There is a grocery, and a man is arranging some candy he has just gotten. He mumbles something about, ""According to Hume...."" and I figure he is a former professor of philosophy who has gotten trapped in this little town with nothing to do but be a grocer. He tells us that this is the last shipment of candy from the candy factories. I wonder why, if there is still such good shipping and facilities, someone isn't busy making more candy instead of just sitting around doing nothing."
"187"	"(08/04/64)"	"I was as if reading -- seeing -- being a novel by Jane Austen (so it was in the dream, although this isn't really a Jane Austen type) of a little girl in Puritan times in New England, sort of masochistically un-fun-loving and full of religious fervor, who liked to endure hardships unnecessarily. I was not enjoying the novel, but kept up with it because it was supposed to be a classic and therefore had to be good. This ""novel"" merged into another story based on Moby Dick. A small boy by a lake was fishing, and from the dark water some enormous thing rose up and ate all of his line. He ran away. The dark thing in the water was a whale which was going to devour everything, or at least was very threatening. Some man was going to go out in a boat and fight it, I think. "
"188"	"(08/04/64)"	"A dream by the seashore, with my husband and my daughter and some couple of other people (a couple I didn't particularly care for). Waves suddenly came in from two directions and started to cut us off from shore. I ran up through the water to a wall and climbed it and got out. Then I looked back and saw everyone else trapped in the middle. My husband was half-buried in sand. I started crying and praying. My husband made it out, but everyone else was drowned. I was very happy to have him escape, but very upset that my daughter had drowned."
"189"	"(08/04/64)"	"There was a sort of traveling show, very small, in town. I was in it. The officials didn't want us to be there, so were making arbitrary laws to get us out, and confiscated all our belongings. There was nothing we could do about it. They had us stay in the upstairs of this house, which was rather nice, though old-fashioned. I looked down and saw the mayor's wife going through my suitcase and counting all the children's clothes as she took them out. She was going to give them to the Salvation Army. I ran down and started fighting with her. I was very mad. One part I remember clearly was biting her fingers -- they were very waxy and I bit way into them, but it didn't seem to bother her at all, although I was revolted and thought she must have some horrible disease. How this turned out -- some woman whom I had thought before all of this that I wouldn't like, came in and wanted to help me. She was elderly, plumpish, named Mrs. Zamock or something. We went upstairs to plan how she could help us get out."
"190"	"(08/04/64)"	"My husband and I were looking for houses. One right uptown for $150/month. At first we thought we couldn't possibly take it, but it was very nice inside -- all white and cool, with some teak panels or something. In back was a large patio, some trees and grass, and a large, cool lake with some artificial islands in it. I was showing this lake to my daughter and we were walking around it toward a large rock, when suddenly a wave like an ocean wave broke over it and swept us up toward the house. My daughter was scared and I decided it was too dangerous for the children to live there, especially since the house -- the patio, anyway, was now completely surrounded by water."
"191"	"(08/09/64)"	"I was going swimming with my husband and several other people in an indoor pool. It was some sort of a class; we were supposed to learn a technique I read about to keep from drowning in emergencies. The pool seemed to get smaller and smaller and too many people were in it, so I couldn't practice. Then the session was over and I went to get dressed again; another group (all girls; except for me, the first one had been male) was getting ready to go for their session. I had on my daughter's bathing suit under mine; it had faded red all over me. I went out after dressing; outside the building was the ocean, and there was a storm; it was all around us; we were on some sort of a pier; toward land was a road or railroad track, and in the dusk it looked as if green water were continually streaming down the bank; we finally saw that it was several large panes of glass leaning against it. Across the water some distance away was another building where a swimming class was being held. My daughter came out, with another child in her arms, and started crossing the water toward us. There was no way she could hear us call to go back over the sound of the water, so we waited, afraid for her to get to us. In spite of the storm and deep water, she made it, and I ran down to the end of the pier to help her up. She and the little child she was helping were almost the same size. I picked them up in my arms and carried them inside and started looking for towels and things to wrap them in to keep them warm."
"192"	"(08/10/64)"	"Some vague dream about my husband and I camping.  We wanted to go riding one day, up to the falls, even though it was late August and the water was drying up. We saw a couple of ropes stretched between the two cliffs above the falls, and finally realized when I saw a man sitting on it (this man sort of flew off into space) that it was a bridge and our mule trip would go over it. This was sort of frightening and I didn't know if I really wanted to go."
"193"	"(08/10/64)"	"Two men, my husband, and I were going somewhere. It was night. There was a curving dirt road through green fields and dirt banks. One of the men, the older one, was driving our car, and my husband and I were upset by this, only mildly though."
"194"	"(08/12/64)"	"Some long allegorical dream in which four people sat around a table, dressed in black, red, and white, representing the alchemical process of preparing the philosopher's stone. "
"195"	"(08/12/64)"	"My husband and I were in the mountains, perhaps at times the Swiss Alps. Very green and lovely. We felt acclimated after having been there a week and wanted to take a short hike, without the children. I had a hard time persuading my mother, who had gotten in the dream somehow, to keep the children for a few hours. We had been staying with Barbara and Jan, etc., while they had been gone, so it seemed only fair."
"196"	"(08/12/64)"	"This dream started like a novel perhaps. A man, a doctor maybe, lived in the valley. Married to a woman who became me. With them lived a friend-servant of the man, very handsome and young. Wife wondered why he was unmarried; thought perhaps there was some homosexual attraction between the two men, was asking her husband if the two had ever discussed sex. This apparently was something that English men, which these were, did not do with the sort of frequency that American males do. As a matter of fact, they had talked about it once, and the husband was supposed to help this man have an orgasm by manipulating him. The wife, me, volunteered to help, but the husband thought she was too good a woman to be used so scientifically. Now this whole thing shifts somehow. It becomes a couple who is living with the doctor and wife. They had been on a walk, and return. It is the wife who needs help, and I and she start exchanging looks which are suddenly all full of desire (she had found out somehow about my wish to help). So we went upstairs to her room (another woman was jealous of  all this and tried to follow us) and tried to lock the door (it was my mother's room), but it didn't lock securely. She embraced me and I no longer felt all the desire I had felt, but sort of thought I was under an obligation to go along a little, since I had given her this impression. I told her the other woman was likely to come in any minute, so I wanted to appear innocent. I was reading an advertising magazine from some towel company and getting all involved in the types of towels and nightgowns they had for sale."
"197"	"(08/12/64)"	"Driving along with some people in a car and spotting, down in a valley below, two giraffes drinking at a pond."
"198"	"(08/13/64)"	"Traveling. Late at night, back and forth on a sort of freeway, but on a tram-like thing which you gave verbal directions to over a speaker and which then carried you. I, some girl, and a Negro man were on this one. When we got off, I and the Negro man embraced ; at any rate, I felt very warm toward him. "
"199"	"(08/13/64)"	"An involved dream about two girls who were cheating jurists out of money, blackmailing them in some strange way. A corrupt family in which these two sisters brought their daily earnings home to their father. Also a young man was involved somehow in these dealings, and it seems there was some sort of sexual attraction between him and me. It was a mixture of reading about the episode on a poster, seeing it, and being involved in it. Linda and Lori were in it too. I was taking care of them and telling them a story about a pumpkin who lived all alone in the forest, with vine arms and legs. He wanted someone to like him and play with him, but no one would because of his scary Halloween face. A dog and a deer ran away from him. The kids weren't paying too much attention to my story, so I never got to finish it, but the ending was going to be that a little boy would come along and take the pumpkin home to be his jack-o-lantern."
"200"	"(08/13/64)"	"Another dream about San Francisco. I was driving through the town, which was also at times a map, trying to find my way out and back to the freeway. It was very involved and I never did get it straight."
"201"	"(08/16/64)"	"I was driving with the children in the car down some street in a town, very fast, and I couldn't see clearly out of the windows. I must not have been able to control the car either because I saw a blue car come from a side street and didn't stop, so I sideswiped it. I managed to stop and pull off the road, and told a policeman it was my fault. He didn't seem too upset with me and was just asking me a few questions, including a short personality sketch. I told him I was easy-going, but had a great sense of responsibility, and my husband came up about this time and said I wasn't easy-going at all, that that was my biggest problem. The blue car was still in the street all this time. It was like Diane's VW. The occupants had disappeared and I had no idea whether they had been hurt or not."
"202"	"(08/16/64)"	"Another dream about being in a town where trains kept coming through. Then there was a series of boxcar-like buildings that became perhaps a train. A woman's league had one of these and used it in some way to help children. I went inside. There was nothing but the side opening, a door at one end, and a small trap door overhead. Children were going through this, but I knew I wouldn't fit, so I didn't even try, though I saw some literature on what a fine view there was from the top. Instead, I went through the door at the side, and began traveling through a series of boxcars in this manner, finding I was proceeding at a fast rate contrasting with another time in which I had gone through this part of town in the streets and had had a long time to do it. I came to more open country as I approached the end of the train, which now became a sort of barge on the bay or a large river. All sorts of heavy freight was spread out on the decks. I needed to get off, and saw a very shaky series of logs and planks which other people were going over to reach shore. I was afraid to try, but someone assured me it was easy, so I went over, and didn't really have any trouble. I got to the last log, an enormous thing, and sat down to talk to the old man who seemed to be posted there as a sort of guardian. I had forgotten, I think, why I wanted to reach shore, and didn't want to get off until I remembered."
"203"	"(08/16/64)"	"There were three levels of something, in a big communistic sort of setup, also perhaps 1984ish. The top level was on the surface of this town, a sort of hick town; the second level housed mainly a cafeteria and also was concerned with information; the bottom level had all sorts of more subtle jobs and was where I wanted to be, because I wanted to get help to overthrow or change the whole setup of the place which I didn't like. The government forces were mainly concentrated in the top level, if I remember. I was being sent to the second level to replace a worker there, and had a cared for identification. The type of thing that was done there was that people sat around reading all sorts of books and copying them for use throughout the whole community (and censoring them, undoubtedly). This seemed like the height of stupidity and uselessness to me, which was probably another reason why I wanted to go down to the third level and try to find some way to get out."
"204"	"(08/24/64)"	"I was going to Sunday School and was late. I had to walk into the closed classroom and find my seat (#22), which didn't embarrass me particularly. The instructor remembered my name, which surprised me. I and my husband were engaged in shooting down some several people who were our enemies. He left me with a pistol and a bottle of some sort of poison. I poisoned someone and shot someone else, or at least this is the aspect that the dream had later, though the first part of the dream was concerned with some man (like Baudelaire) shooting someone else and me. However, for the rest of the time, I got the man's gun away from him and was going to get rid of it, but was afraid the police would accuse me since my fingerprints would be on it, I was trying to get rid of the evidence and escape. All this was uptown in some city. I went into a drugstore. Several people were suspicious of me. I wanted to throw away the bottle, but at every opportunity someone would come and I couldn't. The dream ended when I was wandering through some park and talking to some men about something related to all of this."
"205"	"(08/26/64)"	"I was mad at my husband because he was inviting these absolute strangers over for supper, and the fancy meal of beef stroganoff I wanted to fix for them, they didn't like because they didn't like rich foods. The family consisted of a man and woman, and an older fat woman who dictated to the others what they were to do. She wore a fantastic long gown of pink satin with gold around the neck and throat. I kept asking people if she didn't belong to some religious order and they kept saying no, but I knew she must belong to some secret order. "
"206"	"(08/28/64)"	"Some man had written a book, which was condensed in some magazine, about taming wild horses. For some reason I very much wanted to read this and was disappointed when I saw how skimpy the article was. There were many illustrations of him, however, and his preoccupation with weapons, which he took pride in making himself -- spears and lances and armor. I was talking to Marlene Clapper about him and I told her he was really a psychopath. Now it seems he was in our house and acting in a very threatening way, besides just being malicious and breaking things and taking things. I begged someone to get him out of the house or something terrible would happen, and to lock him up. I wasn't heeded, though, and that night he did kill several people. I was down in the kitchen and I gathered all the knives up. He had turned into a woman meanwhile, who came into the kitchen, followed by a policeman or detective. I picked up one of the butcher knives; she picked up a small paring knife. I got her to drop it, and stabbed her in the chest right under the ribs. She kept being threatening, so I pushed the knife in until I could feel the heart throbbing against the point. She quieted down then and with the man and I on either side of her, we started out the door. A man and small boy in a car right outside on the lawn asked her for directions somewhere, and we let her give them. He didn't seem to notice the blood all down her dress. Then we walked toward the car. I was very alert, because I figured she was still capable of trying anything to escape, and knives were the only weapons we had against her. We got to the car, which was a small yellow sports car, and started off toward the police station. On the way, we saw all sorts of interesting old houses and things and the dream sort of faded out indefinitely."
"207"	"(09/02/64)"	"The dream started with my meeting someone with whom I had gone to high school, a popular girl. We were happy to see each other and exchanged things about what we were doing and planning to do. It seems I was living in the equivalent of Victory Village, rather she was, for I was in her one-room house and she was telling me how she had fixed it up. (No, it was my place, for she was commenting on how the drapes were too long.) From here it went, I believe, into that my husband and I weren't married, but were living together in a one-room sort of place like this -- it was his place, but I had moved in with him. My mother had been up once and caused a terrible scene, and I was fixing up a place under my bed where I could hide if she came back again when I was there. We were making love one night when I heard her cough and knew she was coming. My husband got out of bed and got some clothes on, but I stayed in bed. I didn't hide as I had previously planned. It was not my mother, but my daddy and my brother. They came in and tried to act as if they thought everything was all right and I was doing a quite natural thing, but it was obvious that they, especially daddy, were very upset. As we talked, I was slipping into my pj's under the cover. All of a sudden daddy got up and went outside and started vomiting. I knew it was because he was upset, but it made me mad that, if he was that upset, he should come and pretend that he wasn't. Our tiny house was now a VW bus fixed up, and he opened the door and vomited into the back of it. I got very mad and shouted at him, and he couldn't really understand what I was talking about, as if he didn't understand what he was doing and why. My sister-in-law and brother were both there now, and they all were preparing to leave. My sister-in-law and brother avoided my eyes as if they thought I had done something awful. Through this whole dream there was very little of this overwhelming guilt feeling that I used to have in connection with all of this. What I was doing seemed so right and their reactions seemed so far removed from what they should be, that I could not really feel that I was doing something wrong. The only real emotion I felt was anger at daddy, and then I felt that this was wrong because he didn't really know what he was doing."
"208"	"(09/24/65)"	"I was trying to escape with my brother from our parents. We crept out early in the morning with camping stuff and rode off on horses down a long street, where we found a national forest we could enter without the horses."
"209"	"(09/24/65)"	"I was taking an exam, sort of high-schoolish. Teacher was going over the questions first and everyone had an opportunity to look up answers in their books, but I couldn't find the right books and anyplace to sit; no paper, etc. Something to do with Alaska, also, and how you would get back to the U.S. through Canada, no roads N-S, only a long river that sparkled on the map, a tiny Eskimo propelled canoe through it. Everyone else was through with the exam and left; at last I had a seat, but they were painting the room and moving everything around and there was a lot of noise, so I went outside, hoping that my former geology lab instructor would follow me. He didn't; I went inside and found that this Negro painter had painted my pocketbook dark brown like the walls; I was sure he had done it on purpose (out of stupidity rather than any particular malice) and told him to take all the paint off with paint remover."
"210"	"(09/24/65)"	"There was a virulent new religion, very dogmatic and oppressive. Sort of a stony atmosphere -- my husband had been outspoken against it and had had to flee; I had an invitation to go to church on Friday morning with my children, and knew I had to go if I wanted to survive around this place. My husband had fled to Canada, where he had worked hard to find a job -- selling extra heavy sheets to Canadians -- and to buy a life insurance policy for 10,001 dollars so he would provide for me if anything happened. He had also managed to find a room right over our home, where he could hear the sounds of his son learning to talk (naturally Canada is up). I didn't know what had happened to him; but he managed to slip away and see me for a few minutes, so I knew he was alright."
"211"	"(09/24/65)"	"Reading about a nudist colony in Arizona, being told about it, wondering if it had any connection with peyote ceremonies. I and some woman were going to visit it; we got there, and wandered around for a while -- they grew a lot of different vegetables and flowers. Then I saw everyone had on sort of smocks, and I discovered that they had put them on so as not to offend me, because I wasn't mature enough to be there, which insulted me and yet at the same time, made me doubt if I was. Finally the head of the colony came up to me, a little man, and explained to me that I was partly mature and partly not, and having conflicts now, but I should try to be mature or else I wouldn't be -- if I didn't take off my clothes on the first day, I never would. Everyone was gathered around me -- all dressed -- waiting to see what I would do; I was now with my husband who also was urging me to do this. We went to a place where there were many different sized sinks filled with water; one fairly large one I decided to use, and started to undress. I got undressed, not particularly embarrassed, and got into the sink, which was large enough to sit in. I sat there relaxing, and wondered why no one else had taken off their clothes -- they were in various stages of undress or fully clothed; my husband had on swimming trunks and a shirt and was talking to someone and making no move to undress. It was strange."
