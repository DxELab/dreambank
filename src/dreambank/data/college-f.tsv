"001-1"	"None"	"#001-1 I was in a living room with my several friends. It was almost 9pm. Friend A asked me what I was going to do that night. I said that I was planning to watch Richard Wagner's symphony on TV. Soon, the program began. But the music sounded more like Gustav Mahler's. He is my favorite composer, but I didn't know for sure which symphony was being played. I just knew it was Mahler's, but not Wagner's. TV was showing pictures of the cosmos and a woman in white dress dancing. The woman seemed to be lost to meditation. It was an extraordinarily beautiful sight. Everybody else in the room gazed at the screen. I was still trying to figure out whose music it was. When the first movement ended, TV screened the title of the second movement. It had a name of some comet, which I was not familiar with. But I understood that the music was Gustav Holst's, ""The Planets."" (This is ridiculous because no movement in ""The Planets"" has a name of unknown comet.) Suddenly, I heard an alarm and noticed that the whole room was trembling. I went out of the room and found that I was inside of a big battleship. Many people in uniform were running around in a panic, but I remained calm, looking at the terrible scene wondering why they were so flustered. I went to the deck. It was still dark and the ocean looked very peaceful."
"001-2"	"None"	"#001-2 I was in my junior high school. We were supposed to bring foods for a cooking class. But no one in my group knew and brought anything. The school had a school lunch program and pots and pans had been already brought in and the classroom was filled with the smell of food. The teacher said that since we were going to have a cooking class, we didn't need foods provided by the school. I had to take a big heavy pan filled with some soup back to the food serving center. I was walking through a hallway. I was not in my junior high school but in my elementary school. When I finally arrived at the place where the center was supposed to be, I noticed that the school had been reconstructed and I had to go still further. The hallway was colored in green and seemed to lead to nowhere. It was like the yellow brick road in the Land of Oz. I crossed many hallways and each was a different color. The last hallway I crossed was colored in blue with a faint light. It had the name, ""Snow Road."" It was beautiful, and I thought that I had better tell my friends about this hallway when I got back to the classroom. I was now standing in a big hall. The green road forked off in several directions. One of them led to the harbor. I saw a man in a suit and asked him if he worked there. He said that he was supposed to see the principal but had lost his way. I said that since I was a student there, I might be able to help him. He said it was ok and disappeared. I saw the food serving center far in the right direction and walked toward that direction. When I finally arrived at the center, I asked a woman where I should put the pan. She said that I had to pour the contents into another pan. I did as she said, but the pan was not big enough. I left both pans on the table anyway. When I was washing my hands, I saw a teacher coming. I didn't know why, but I pretended that I was working for the center. I went out of the center and saw the man in a suit in the room next to the center, talking with the principal. I came back to the big hall, but I didn't know which road led to the classroom. I took the straight road and continued to walk. I passed the harbor. I was in a downtown area, which didn't look like Boston's or the downtown of any other American city. I knew that I had lost my way, but I kept walking. I was now walking through an alley. I thought that if I knew where the Prudential was, I could find my way. Since I was surrounded by buildings, I couldn't see anything. Then a truck came into the alley. I was almost killed. I saw another truck beyond the building and asked the driver if he could see the Prudential. He didn't hear me. Someone else answered. It was the voice of the driver of the first truck. Then, I saw the city of Boston far away. I asked him if he could give me a ride to Boston. He said that we were on a highway and had to turn around at the next intersection. We walked toward the intersection. The roads were too narrow, but the driver managed to turn the truck and I jumped in. I told him that it might be dangerous to use this highway, especially during rush hour. He said that since no one in Maine went to Boston for work, there had been no traffic jam on this highway."
"001-3"	"None"	"#001-3 I was about to take a plane to London with three of my friends. But the plane had already taken off. We followed the plane by car through the streets and finally managed to jump in it. It was a small plane without one [illegible] . Since there was no pilot, friend A had to fly the plane. When I looked down, I saw a map. We were flying over the big map. I could see the details, such as the mountains, the rivers, the deserts, and the forests, but not a single town. They looked real, but I knew that it was a map. We flew over the Middle East through Eastern Europe. Finally, we reached Siberia. All I could see was the frozen forest and I felt chilly. We wore as many clothes as possible. Then, we noticed that we were short of fuel. So friend A decided to make a landing. Landing went smoothly, and we landed in some unknown town. We went to search for fuel and came across a mansion. We entered the mansion and found out that it had been deserted. Somehow I felt alarmed and started running. There was no light inside, but something like lightning flashed once in a while. I knew that someone was following me. I could hear the footsteps. I finally got out from the mansion and found a hut. My friends were already there and there was also a middle-aged man. We asked him if he could spare us fuel. He wanted something (I can't recall what it was) in return. When we were ready to go on our journey, we saw the fuel tank of the middle-aged man blow up with a terrific explosion. Someone had shot the tank with a machine gun from the bush. No one was hurt."
"001-4"	"None"	"#001-4 I was in my grandfather's house. (He has been dead for six years.) I was lying down on a bed in a living room. It was an old studio, with which I was not familiar. I got up wondering which I should do: go back to sleep or study for a literature exam. My grandfather was cooking something. I noticed that two of my cousins also were there. One of them asked me if I wanted to have dinner with them. I said that since I had an exam the next day, I had to go home and study. They gave me a ride. It was dark outside. When we came closer to a tennis court, we noticed that there were many people both inside and outside the tennis court. We stopped the car and I went to see what was going on. I saw David Bowie talking to someone on a bench outside the tennis court. I entered the tennis court. It looked like a concert hall in the open air and was crowded with people. I found a friend of mine from high school and asked him what was about to happen. He said that David Byrne was expected to give a concert. Since he was not my favorite musician, I left the tennis court. On my way back to the car, I saw David Byrne singing and dancing a weird dance. I thought that the lighting was beautiful."
"004-1"	"None"	"#004-1 I was at my cottage down the cape with my whole family (cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.). We were having a cookout on the deck, buffet style. But when I took a plate and walked along the table, the food consisted of turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, etc. There was no regular ""cookout food."" I also remember getting ready for the cookout and looking in the mirror. I was about 30 pounds heavier and my hairstyle was awful. I was ugly and fat."
"004-2"	"None"	"#004-2 I went camping with my boyfriend and a few friends. We were falling asleep in the tent when I noticed a few frogs creep into the tent through a hole. I woke up my boyfriend and for some reason everyone was blaming me for the frogs. By then they were all over the place, jumping on our heads. The next thing I knew we were driving home with all the frogs in the car because I wouldn't let my friends kill them. I made them pull over so I could toss them into a stream off the side of the highway."
"004-3"	"None"	"#004-3 I was at an amusement park and I went on the water slide. But it wasn't the kind that you sat or lay down. You stood up, kind of like waterskiing. Anyway, it was crazy, and there was no way anyone could last this ride. The slide itself was metal and I remember looking around, and it looked like I was inside a factory or something. (Now comes the strange part.) I made it through the whole ride and landed in a pool of water. I went underneath and came up, and there was Michael J. Fox in the water with me and we started kissing. I guess he was my boyfriend or something. We just swam and kissed the rest of the dream. (???)"
"004-4"	"None"	"#004-4 My sister, Lauren, my mother and myself were at some sort of graduation exercise outdoors. We were driving there and we parked alongside a steep hill. I looked out my window, and I could see the caps and gowns below. For some reason we didn't get out of the car. We noticed a brown station wagon parked behind us. There were two men in the car. They appeared to be packaging drugs and putting them in the trunk. My mother and sister were in the front seat and were staring at them in the rear view mirrors. The guys saw them looking. They jumped out of the car and ran over to us with guns. I yelled, ""Duck!"" and they shattered our windows. My mother screeched away and they hopped in their car and followed us. We finally lost them. Next thing I knew we're at home and the doorbell rang. The driver of the station wagon came in. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and army pants. He had tattoos all over his arms. I pretended to like him and told him I wasn't interested in going to the police. I told him I was very attracted to him and I wanted to be his girlfriend. He believed me. He kissed me. He was gross. Then I woke up."
"006-1"	"None"	"#006-1 I had a dream that I was riding on a ski lift with other people. I don't think I knew the people. I was going to class but it took a long time to get there. It became scary for a while because something was wrong with the ride. I remember thinking that I shouldn't have gone on the ski lift, that I should have walked instead. I think by the time I got to class, it was over. I remember leaving some of my things on the ride but there was no way for me to get them back."
"006-2"	"None"	"#006-2 I had a dream that my friend and I were walking in my neighborhood all dressed up ready to go somewhere. We were passing some of my neighbors, just saying hi to them. We went to one particular neighbor's house. We both had trouble getting up to his front step. We had to struggle. (This neighbor does have a steep driveway.) There were dirt and rocks involved like we were trying to climb a mountain. We asked him if he would take us out to a club. He told us he could get us into some club. He said he would drive us, but we said that my friend would drive because we know how he drives (crazy)."
"006-3"	"None"	"#006-3 I had a dream where I used to work, the guys' clothes store called Dejaiz (a chain of the merry-go-round). I remember talking to people who I worked with but I don't remember exactly who they were. I remember one of them saying that I had better do a better job selling or they would fire me. Then up on the roof there was someone famous, so I ran over to see him. He was on stage so one of the bodyguards told me to go up the stairs because the bodyguard had mistaken me for someone else. So I did and he knew who I was and I knew who he was but then the dream ended because my mother was looking for me. She was calling my name."
"006-4"	"None"	"#006-4 This dream was about where I work now, at the candy store in the mall. Only one person works at a time so it is hard to call in. I was supposed to work but I forgot or couldn't get a ride or get down to work. I was working from my telephone at my house, in my room. When I woke up, I figured it was impossible because how can you work from a telephone at your house?"
"007-1"	"None"	"#007-1 I am walking up this hill with my friend Carolyn (in the neighborhood where my grandmother lives) and we see her cousin Joe. He is washing a car. (Joe does not live in my grandmother's neighborhood. I also have a crush on Joe, though he is really shy.) We see him and he joins us on our walk. We end up at a convenience store and Carolyn buys a magazine. When we leave he holds my hand and acts in an outlandish way (shouting, jumping. This is very unlike Joe. He is very still and quiet in character.) That is all I remember."
"007-2"	"None"	"#007-2 I dreamt I was working as a hairdresser for this woman's private business in her home. I don't remember what this woman looked like or if she was a friend of mine, but in the dream we were best of friends. I only remember cleaning the shop and sweeping the hair off the floor in the beauty parlour. I remember her saying that she would teach me how to cut hair and for now I could just sweep. I remember feeling excited that I was going to cut hair. It was as though it was the only thing I ever wanted to do in the dream. (I have never desired to be a hair dresser in my life.) That is all I remember."
"007-3"	"None"	"#007-3 I dreamt that I was in this room with no windows or doors and it was completely black. But, as I was moving around I kept bumping into people. (There were many in the room; I just couldn't see them.) I was also carrying a pile of books and then they dropped everywhere. I tried to pick them up but people kept stepping on me and kicking the books everywhere. When I woke up my heart was beating really fast and I swear the clock was ticking faster. (This was a really scary dream. I think it was the anxiety I was feeling because of final week sneaking up quickly.)"
"007-4"	"None"	"#007-4 This dream was ultimately strange and [illegible] enough. I remembered it before I was going to bed (on the next night of the dream). I was at Suffolk and I remember walking up the stairs to the State House Arena across from the Fenton Building. But, there was a house, a huge house with a big fence around it and it had grand doors (like doors on a church - wooden and carved). I went inside and walked up these very steep, narrow stairs to use the bathroom. (I don't know how I knew it was upstairs.) Anyway, there were a lot of people downstairs like a party was going on and as I closed the door to the bathroom a girl walked by the hall and called for her mother. Suddenly the mother appeared and directly asked me to leave. She said this was not the haunted house (?) And she was sick of ""those"" students looking for it and she wished they would get the address right. Feeling really sad, I left. But as I was leaving in the yard playing ping pong, with many people standing around watching, was Al Pacino. (I guess it was his house??)"

And Randy goes, ""Gee, you haven't changed. You still have big boobs and you look like a monkey."" Well, we both started laughing. And Gina replied, ""I don't know why I came here anyhow. You are both still obnoxious and I hate the both of you."""
"011-1"	"None"	"#011-1 I was shopping in Osco Drug with my brother. I picked up what I wanted. (I don't remember what it was.) I was then looking at typing paper trying to figure out what bond I should have used for resume in English last year. I remember seeing Mead's recycled typing paper, but I figured that would probably be a gray color. I then walked down the make-up aisle. I was looking for a deep facial cleanser. I couldn't find one. Then I saw a make-up case. It was big, and it was covered with a pretty carpet. I remember thinking it was like the bag Mary Poppins carries in the movie. Then I saw Rob from school (Suffolk). I thought this was strange, because he lived far away from me. He was standing at a counter writing something. A classmate from my high school walked up to him. She started saying to him, ""So, did you hear the news about Type A personalities? (I had this feeling they were studying to be doctors.) I awoke from this dream to realize my radio was on, and they were talking about how Type A personality people have a Vitamin E deficiency or something."
"011-2"	"None"	"#011-2 I had a dream about marriage noodle. They came in a blue can that was the shape of the Quaker Oats box. These noodles were kind of like soup only without much liquid in them. The expiration date on the noodles was for 60 years from now. I remember trying to figure out how they could last that long, and if they would last that long if they were opened, or would they only last that long if they were not opened."
"011-3"	"None"	"#011-3 I had a dream about watching a show where a dog went blind. It was too sad and I couldn't watch it. Then the dream switched and my cat is blind. Then we had gone to the vet where he sewed something together in the cat's head. The cat could then see. The cat became blind again. Apparently the thing the vet had fixed broke. The cat then had trouble getting around. My mom said he would have to be put to sleep. I refused to let this happen, because the cat was perfectly healthy except he was blind. I believed he would adapt and be able to find his way around without a problem. I remember hugging the cat, realizing they might put him to sleep. I then told my father the cat couldn't be put to sleep, but all he said was he would ask the vet what we should do. I was looking at the cat's eyes. They were bloodshot. My mom said maybe it was just a fluid buildup and it would go away soon. I remembered hoping it was, so he wouldn't have to be put to sleep."
"011-4"	"None"	"#011-4 I had this dream where my friend Jen was making fun of my puffy hair. Then my other friend Sara started saying more things about it.

He is this kid we have known for about three years. The whole dream was not a complete story. It was just different scenes. I went from being at a friend's house with my friend and the kid she is seeing; to being at the Bruins game with just me and him. We were having a great time. Then in the next scene, we were at a wedding, but I did not know the people who were getting married. It was so strange. I was also in an ugly dress which I would never wear. It was gaudy and fitted and strange. The kid I was with gave me a grin which I absolutely could not stand. Then we were at my school and he was kissing another friend of mine. Then I woke up. It was very strange."
"012-2"	"None"	"#012-2 Last night's dream was quite unusual. I was at the place where I work, but none of the faces seemed the same. Everyone looked different except for me. I really felt like I did not fit in there, and everywhere I turned and everything I tried to do was different. It was as if I could not do anything right, and I didn't fit in anywhere. It was an awful feeling. I was wearing a dress and I had long, curly hair. The strangest thing about the dream was that every time I finished doing something, I found the same paperwork in front of me. It showed up in every room I went into. I could not escape from it. I wanted to scream. Every time I put the work away, it seemed to follow me. I could not complete anything the whole day. At the end, I was at my home with some man I guess was my husband. He said he had to talk to me. When I went into the room, he was holding the paperwork. It was [illegible] ."

A good friend of mine (male) was teasing me and aggravating me, like he usually does, when I had the strangest urge to hit him. When I went to hit him, I could not move my hands. I forgot about this instance, and in the next scene I was in the same bar and this same kid was teasing me. Enough was enough, and I went to punch him. This time I had no hands. This continued one more time, except this last time I had only one arm and one hand. I was chasing him out of the bar and into a forest ready to punch him with my hand, making a fist, when I was awakened by my alarm."

The bridesmaids wore green. Just when the ceremony was going perfectly, I saw that his current girlfriend was one of my bridesmaids. This was really weird, because we do not get along with one another. Another strange thing about this ceremony was that once we were married, we were running in the Summer Tunnel but we could not get out. There were other people walking there too. It was like one lane was for driving a car, and the other lane was for walk-throughs. It was real weird. I still had on my wedding gown and he had on his tux. We just could not get out of the tunnel. It seemed like we walked for days. Then in the next scene, we were in a [illegible] house that was unfamiliar to me and we were eating pizza and grapes. I still had the gown on. Then in the next scene we were still in the tunnel but sitting down taking a break from running. The dream was not like a story, it was just like a bunch of scenes that did not make any sense."

I think it was my high school gym. There were five people to be seated on a platform that faced the spectators. I was one of them. They were all women. At one point another woman had to squish between me and another because there wasn't any room left. After that there was a speaker. She faced us, not the spectators. She was weird-looking, but voguish, she had walkmans on. She recited this weird poem. When she said the last line another speaker also said it at the same time, as if she knew the whole poem. Then we all got up and I assume we were going to a larger room. This is when I saw people that I knew I wouldn't be graduating with, so I left. I walked up some stairs. I was supposed to be in school, but it looked like the Burlington Mall, but without the stores. I got to the ninth floor and went into my Informal Logic class. My teacher made bacon. Everyone got the first piece free, but if you wanted more it would cost 2 cents a slice. There was even a sign on a plate that had the bacon on it."

A guy came out of his house and was threatening the lady. The next time I loked at her she was burnt (but like in cartoons, not really raw red burn). Then she tried to get away from him in a cornfield. The next scene they were on a cruise ship. There was a lounge. The bartender was talking to another guy. The lady came in and tried to make a scene like they were arguing in an attempt to get some help. The bartender was too busy listening to the other guy. Then the couple disappeared.

Next her daughter (?) came in from behind a screen door. She was very attractive with long blond full hair, lots of make-up, wearing jeans, long earrrings, blue eyes. She all of a sudden said to the reporter something like, ""Listen, you can tell Skinner (meaning B.F. Skinner) that you can't observe my behavior only; you don't know what I think.""

The driver's side door looked like someone took a metal stick or pole and scraped it. The front of my car looked like someone just smashed right into it and left. Then some kid who I know because he is an acquaintance of my ex-boyfriend told me that he knew who smashed my car. I kept asking him who did it, but he wouldn't tell me.

Anyway, you could tell that the person was getting aggravated with me, but I was in such a bad mood that I didn't care. Finally he got out of his car and started yelling at me.

Then I was just roaming around and I bumped into all my friends and my ex-boyfriend's friends. My ex-boyfriend was not there. Once I bumped into them I could feel myself getting very upset and angry. They started to tell me what my ex-boyfriend was up to. I can't remember exactly what was said, but I do know that it made me cry. My friends and my family were there and they tried to calm me down. This all took place in my grandmother's backyard. After I stopped crying, I went over to the swings and began to play on the jungle gym and play on the swings. The funny part about that is that my grandmother hasn't had a swing set in her yard for about 10 or 12 years now. She had the swings when I was a little girl. Also in my dream while I was playing on the swings there was no pool in the yard, and my grandmother has had a pool since I was either 12 or 13 and I am now 21."

I grabbed my mother's hand and ran to the storage part of the plane. The plane was falling, but not head first. It was falling flat. Since it was falling this way, we were elevated to the ceiling. I then heard the captain say, ""This is it."" I told my mother that I loved her and I think I started to pray. The plane crashed on its belly and I fell from the ceiling to the floor. My mother and I both were fine, just a little banged up. I was so happy, but then this fear came over me that the plane could still blow up. I ran to the door and tried to open it up, but it was locked. I looked out the window and saw a bunch of police out there with their guns drawn. However, all I could think about was the plane could still blow up and we had to get out of there. I saw a fire extinguisher and I tried to knock out the window. As I was doing this, the captain and some passengers were yelling at me not to do it because the police might shoot. They tried to explain that there were hijackers on board and the police might get anxious and start shoooting. But I didn't listen. I think I thought that I would rather take my chances of being shot than die by the plane's blowing up. So I broke open the door. The police raised their guns, but they realized my mother and I were [illegible] so they waved over to us to run to the police cars, which we did. As we were running the plane blew up, but my mother and I made it. Then I woke up."

While I was doing this an attendant came over and said I could park in his parking garage if I wanted to. I asked my friend and we both agreed to park there. We went to Faneuil Hall that night. When we came back to the garage at about 1:30, the parking garage was all lit up with very nice and expensive cars inside. (It looked like the parking area on top of Beacon Hill except it was lit up.) As I proceeded to my car I noticed that my tires were all flat. I was totally flipping out! I couldn't believe that all my tires were flat. Just then I saw out of the corner of my eye my best friend's ex-friend. We never got along in the first place, but when I became friends with my now best friend she became very jealous. She thought I stole her friend away from her. Which of course is quite far from the truth. Anyway, once I saw her I knew that she was the one who did it. I was so angry that I went over to her. She knew I was very angry, so she  started to run. So I ran after her but her boyfriend stopped me. I told her she is going to pay for everything that needed to be fixed on my car. Her boyfriend knew I meant it and even told her she better listen to me."

Since I had nothing to do I decided to follow him. I couldn't believe what I was doing, but I really liked him. He walked into the store and I followed him. I pretended that I was shopping and that I didn't even know that he was there. When I went around an aisle I more or less bumped into him. I acted like I was surprised to see him. We talked a little. It was a bit awkward because we don't know each other that much. We were both pretty much done with shopping and we more or less walked over to the counter together. When we got out of the store it was just about 2:30, so we walked to class together. I [illegible] went to class. When it was over we got on the [illegible] to go for a drink.

(My girlfriend really works at a hospital, but she loves shoes.) Anyway, later on in the same store, my church had a fashion show. There was a lot of food. The dream just seemed to switch.

The next thing I knew, I saw her father-in-law arguing with this woman who he was supposed to be dating. He was trying to tell them both that it was over. Their names were Mary and Toni. So after a while I found myself outside with Trina and Pam. We were going out to eat. We walked by the Boston Common. All of a sudden, Trina started collecting popsicle sticks. She would eat the ice cream and then she would save the sticks. Trina gave the sticks to some guy so he could make a funny object (a doll stick).

It was Bobby's voice, but Devan's face and body. Anyway Devan/Bobby gave me money to go shopping in the mall. I bought soap, lotion and a jacket. Plus, I had my own money. Devan's mother met us at the train station and took us to the Canton mall. His mother thought that we were back together, but we told her that we were just friends. Then I woke up."

(In real life I do feel a sort of connection with this sort of lamp and feel as though I remember my family had one that resembled the one in my dream a long time ago.) The chimney was either missing, broken or crooked, I'm not sure. I was quite agitated about this doll and some of the other items. I may have felt that I didn't want to lose them and felt connected to them in some way."

She said that they were all out and they wouldn't be home for a little while. She asked why I was there. I had a plate of big chocolate chip cookies in my hands. I told her I was delivering these cookies to the family. I noticed that one of the cookies was half-eaten, so I took another cookie and covered over the half-eaten one.
