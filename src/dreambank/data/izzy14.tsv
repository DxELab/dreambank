"0244"	"None"	"(2005-01-29 (14)) There were people from Alias and Victor Garber had this really cool handwriting that I tried to copy. We were doing some mission thing. We tracked down people to a castle thing. I don't know what happened, but we got passed (I think we shot some) guards and then this person caught us and people or something were shooting things at us. None hit us and we escaped with ""important information"". We picked up a call that was meant for other bad guys. They were saying stuff in code that I worked out and they had said something about a playground. Victor Garber's handwriting I mentioned earlier was seen because he had written a letter that I was reading at the castle place. It explained some information about the castle. He had weird t's that looked like the t shown in the diagram, but they were cool. We were at some desk place. There was one person per desk and people were inspecting them. I opened a door and some guy was there and I was apologizing but I actually had to go in to get some messages. Then we were at the playground. The bad guys were almost there which we knew because we could hear their car. We left two people there with a note saying ""Do not harm or we'll play Jay-Z and some woman singer [don't remember who] "" and they didn't hurt them."

I think I found him again and I 'dreamt' again and I saw Jennifer Garner and he was making out with her. Then I finished that dream, and I don't remember what happened properly, but we found out that we liked each other and then we supposedly had sex, which I don't remember and then we were lying in bed and he said something about some Banana in Pajama's banana's penis and I said something how he couldn't have sex because it was probably smushed when he was born."

Mom got Blade for me, size 69, which was really small, though it was a large/medium. Anyway, it was too small and I wanted to go back but she didn't. Then I was at school wearing it and then I scared some evil spider off. Jayson was writing something about his birthday and I said I forgot to do that this year and he thought I was just copying him so I got on the computer, but could only find prev [can't read, starts with a p, and is possibly 'previous'] . This happened at a cemetery? The crazy dude came back. Someone had a baby. Johnny Knoxville was there, but he was some ""Apple"" guy. Then the father of the baby got killed. Johnny put his clothes on and sat in his truck. It had a big playground area for an animal on the back. I saw him and he motioned for me not to tell anyone so I didn't. I got another costume, which was size 71, and it fit. Some people came and we said the baby was dead. They thought it was a joke and we made them run through the house to get out and then I found out that the baby was alive."

Ezra and I were together, but we couldn't find Dad. The alien explained that 2000 years ago something happened and it would cause a holocaust on this day. They had being trying to stop it since. I was worried about not seeing the Green Day concert and my stuff and the pets. Then they said that little brothers could come and pick a dog for the family. I walked off for a second and Ezra came back with a big brown puppy. I said to call it Chico and Ezra said that it was a gay name. I also complained that it was a big dog and that he should've gotten a smaller one. Then I saw Mom and Darren and they had a black and white dog. I told them to call it Chico.

Then we were on this train and it was spooky and there was a shower and when we went under it we got sucked up to this kooky place. The alien guy said it was a ride and we went again.

I can't remember properly, but they took our stuff, including my phone, all our phones, but the young one gave me a phone, for some reason. She kept calling me and teasing me because she had my phone. Mom and I went to the car and they had pulled it apart taking stuff, although one part of her car they didn't check and it had one of Mom's phones, so they hadn't found it.

I didn't wanna change but I went to go back behind a cabinet and I don't know why but they took my shirt off so I could try it on. Whitehall High School people were there and they were being evil. Also, Dad and I were at this shop buying pencils and we got these Monty Python things too. Later, I wanted to go back to the shop, but I couldn't until lunch or recess because they would wonder why I was there.

But then she turned up with a torch. We were at a cafe place. This guy kept talking to us about something and then his wife left him. Then these two scary old people wearing makeup made him and his wife some dinner with strange vegetables. Mom was saying how her painting was taken by Nana 20 years ago. Nana was like ""move"" and then took 'her' painting from a box. Some street name was Chollatel or something. At school we had to picture we were in a cemetery. Then, the teacher, Ms P asked me a question about using an 'ajouk' board. She meant Ouija board. We were playing a board game. We also talked about noses and I had a cold."

There was another one near us, which two people were dancing on. We turned to look and then Ezra made it go spazzy and Jayson and I fell off except some glass part came too and Ezra was fine. We fell into the water. We got out and there was this futuristic place with all these buildings and there was a little boat thing that went underneath the place which was on top of the water. Now, one part of the story was that I was old and I was thinking back, and the other was that I had dreamed it before, but before we knew Jayson, and he was replaying it in first person, and then it was a movie we hadn't seen for ages."

I ended up jumping out of this cart and running back to get her. Then Mom and I were at a fair place. We went on a freaky ride with lots of old people. I said to Mom that I was going to sit on the edge, but some old lady had taken my spot, so Mom sat down elsewhere.

We got in the car and one guy came up to Mom's window, but she drove off. They followed her and ended up crashing into us, we got out of the car before it blew up, then the ranger people died.

He turned into a girl, who decided to be my best friend. We went to a cinema and I found that I could create more rows of seats with people from different times. I made one that would have Michael Palin in it and then I went down and sat next to him. I said hi and he seemed shy or nervous or something. I asked him what the date was and I don't know what he said and I asked the year, and he said 1963. I thought, 'Ok, he's 20'. I started chatting to him and he got up and then motioned for me to follow. He went to a place where they had DVD's. He found A Fish Called Wanda and he was going to get it for me, bit I didn't want to tell him that I had it, so I told him about a special one that I'd seen only at a video shop and it would be cheaper, and we went back to the cinema. We sat in the front row next to each other. He started kissing me, and I was giggling. He was kissing me like when parents kiss their babies, all over their face. My old pal, Will, was getting angry except it wasn't actually Will anymore, but I'm not sure what happened, but the Will thing got angry and we had to go somewhere. I got in this Ute thing and Eric Idle got in the other side to drive. Graham Chapman hopped on a motorbike as did Terry Jones or John Cleese. Not sure which one. Michael and Terry/Darren got in a car. I waved to Graham, maybe mistaking him for Michael. Ezra was in an ice-cream truck thing. We got to a place where they were building a building. I ended up really high, hanging from a rope. I was about to let myself go, when people came around the corner and tied rope to my foot and I went back and I was ok.

We ran away and I called Dad and then we hid in a ditch thing at a park. A policeman drove past and somehow Mom took his car and then got me. We stopped for fish and chips and then we were driving and in lots of places there were police depots? We went in and I remembered to get keys. The lady at the office thing let us in and we were messing around with videos of this lady whose car we had taken. Luckily, she looked a bit like Mom. They had a big DVD player. Some people thought that she was different. The lady gave Mom name tags and she had to put them all on the right person. Then we were allowed out. I went home and I left my bag up on the street. I remembered and ran back to get it. It had stuff missing, like my phone. These two guys were there and one of them had my phone and I snatched it off him and got my jumper and the other put my bag high up in this tree.

I got them to come out and explained to them why I was doing it. The third guy came up to help me. It was all effects up there. It was all made of holograms but I still had to pass it. I was at a 'Timezone' place. It was pretty evil. Mom was there too and you got heaps of points, but it was really hard. There were strange people around."

Anyway, I went to a pub place which was joined to the aforementioned Timezone place [but it was a different dream] . I got home the same time Graham got home and so did his mother, we went to go in but his sister, I think, was on the phone and we listened to her conversation which didn't make sense. We went inside and I cleaned up the sister's room with a piece of paper which sucked things up. I went to my room and was cleaning things up properly, when I heard someone whistling. Graham had opened my door a little and was whistling some song. I turned back around, but he continued whistling and it was annoying. I asked him what he wanted and he said ""a kiss"". It was just a 'peck' [Sims wise] but then it turned into a 'smooch' or 'makeout' (it was extremely vivid, and I can remember how it felt and tasted). I think earlier on in the dream, Graham and his sister had tried out this new trend, which was walking around naked, but Graham didn't like it. Also when we were all walking home, I hugged a pillar near the house and there was 'ae' written on it and I said ""I love a's""."

We then tried escaping but it was no use. I don't know how we got out but then we had to find some dead kid and get something out of him. We walked through this scary swamp and he was there. I had to light a match/lighter to go through him (he was a ghost though). We got the thing we were looking for. Dad had made me wear rubber boots. There was a flashback of something.

I showed Granma and then Mom came and she took me to this place and said that the package and been picked up and the right one was dropped off. Wherever we were, there were two animals that were dead. I was standing close to one but I moved back because I thought it would get up, and it did. It hopped into the bushes.

The people got to Mom's and were messing around at the top of the stairs and I was trying to get Mom to hide my bag. She did, but I ended up getting them out of the house. They were both girls by the way. Mom complained about me having so many animals. I had had a pet sheep called Aaron and I had also had a pig. The moon was big at 12 and when I got Mom to see, she thought I was playing a joke on her."
"0289"	"None"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at school and we had to do sports. Teacher-M-07 was our co-coordinator. No-one wanted to do sport though. There were SNSET people there and the teachers thought it wasn't fair for us, so when the SNSET people were gone we had to [I think SNSET's were speds] ."

There was an ice-cream shop and I was having a look and my tooth started hurting. I found Mom and I pulled my tooth out and it was a baby tooth. Farrah was on the floor being annoying. I didn't get an ice-cream. I was then at home in the bathroom and the doors were closed. Farrah and people from school were there too and we were hiding. Someone knocked on the door, so one girl was trying to get him away, and then I had to get rid of someone else. Later, a vet came; he was odd and was wearing weird clothes. I tried to tell him I didn't think any of our animals were sick but he decided to have a look anyway."

Ezra and I were getting into the car and I noticed all the water was gone. I didn't say anything and we got into the car. Valerie was there too, and she was with us and her and her kids wouldn't get in the car. I then realized all the water was built up in a huge wave. I screamed for Dad to get in the car but Ezra said ""We're gonna die aren't we?"" and I said ""Probably"" and then I decided I didn't wanna die so Dad got in the car and drove off before it was too late. We were safe. We went back though for some reason and it was all calm again, we went back home and everything was fine, but we realized it was happening again so we drove away. Then somehow I ended up in a car with Mom and we drove to this place that was causing the problem. They didn't do anything but they gave us a wireless computer mouse [my mouse stopped working last night] . We drove back again so that I could get my Monty Python DVD's and then it happened yet again and we drove downtown and I asked if we were going to stay at a hotel and we were. It was smelly though, and I was in the garden (it was night time) and there was a cubby house thing, and an old man, that looked like the 'It's' man, was or had told some boys to come up to prove their bravery. One boy did and the man told him to pretend he was getting hurt. So he started screaming and then his friends were laughing because they had set him up and then they had to jump off into this mud pit."

It was a kangaroo in a penguin suit and we thought it was a penguin at first and then it was a person inside and we realized. I went to go into a separate part of the Royal Show. They said I had to be 15+ to go in by myself. But Mom came and I got in. It had all the waterslides and stuff. We left that bit and I went back and I was allowed in. I went into this toy shop and a lady from before said no people under 15 were allowed in. And she read out something about ""no smelly girls or boys under 15"". And I said I am 15. She said ""Oh. When's your birthday?"" and I said ""25 January 1990"". Then she asked me what term I was in. But I didn't get it at first. Then she asked when Baby Day was. I was like ""How should I know?"" Then I said today, because I had seen a poster with a mother and a baby. I was right. I was then backstage somewhere. I was there with some people from school. Also people were building a building over the water and Mom and I almost fell. Jocelyn and I were also walking around somewhere near the penguin thing. Also something someone had was ultra rare but I can't remember."

I went in and got some spaghetti in a bowl. I ate some but an evil person came and I hid under the table but he saw me. I 'paused' the game and he couldn't see me, but he stayed waiting and it wasn't actually a game. Anyway, somehow I got out and met up with Mom and company. We got to the gate and got out of the city. Then I said what if the gate was closed to keep them in. Then we heard them coming and we went to Nana's."

Luckily, it was just implied. Anyway, I wasn't too worried about it and Mom was angry. Mom was trying to have a talk with me in this room. There was a poster on the bed, and Jayson was on one side of the bed, with a picture of Tinkerbell, and on the other side, a picture of Orlando Bloom. I hid next to the bed under the cover and Mom whacked me with a piece of wood to see if it was me, but it wasn't hard and I didn't move, so she decided I wasn't under there and then I popped out. I left the room and I walked past a room with a poster with 'Ugly Elephant Olyphant' on it. Timothy Olyphant was on it, and I thought it was hilarious for some reason. Then I heard a song playing on TV. It sounded like Red Dragon Tattoo, but then it sounded like Stacy's mother and it was Stacy's mother. The clip was before the small guy and Stacy had dated."

I couldn't keep still though, and eventually Dad noticed I was under there."

We had just come back to the car from somewhere. It was a hot day and Mittens needed water. Mom was telling me about when she got her wedding dress and how she didn't look very fat in it. Then we pulled up at some marriage motel thing. Mom told me the people liked playing jokes. We got there and there was a sign that said something like 'Don't park too close to the water'. A car was parked really close to the sign and then a lady ran out saying ""Oh, sorry!"" and she moved her car. It was a joke, but I didn't get it. We went inside and we were booking in or whatever and she said no cats were allowed, and then that no pets were allowed. Then she pulled out a fish, a cat and a dog. I said to Mom that it seemed weird that what she had pulled out were opposites of ours. I told the lady it was a joke and she was denying it and she left. Then her sister came in and let us up. The dog went behind the counter and she looked at us angrily and I thought she was going to say ""no dogs"", but she let us up. I was getting food for the dog when I noticed it was pooing and looked sick. I thought it was another joke so I went downstairs to ask them what their problem was, but I woke up."

They had names like 'Hungry'."

Anyway, this little girl really liked me. She hadn't been there for a while, but she was there this time and she started climbing all over me. This other girl there, an older one, like me (she wasn't one of the orphans) had a video camera and she asked me to record some stuff. It only had 20 minutes of space on it. Later, I was looking up Monty Python stuff on the net and I found pictures of Michael Palin when he was younger."

There was a little 8 year old girl, called Sara and she was dead but some strange thing was going on, and she was married to Graham and was also dating five others, including a Michael Palin gardener guy. But she was only 8 and I asked about this, but I didn't get a proper answer. She told me and Graham to put ear drops in our left ear, so we did. It made a strange noise, but it worked. This gardener bloke had been taken as well, I think. I was 'dating' the Michael Palin gardener and also a Michael Palin other person. Even though I had only been back a day or two. Earlier, we were (all the people that got taken) at this place and it had a big ball of light in the middle and it got smaller and smaller and then disappeared. Then we heard it would be back tonight at this little house thing. 1400 people were in the country by the way. I was walking up a hill with Dad, Ezra, Nana, Poppa and Mike Palin gardener. The other Mike Palin guy was there and said hi. Nana joked that I was dating them. I was, but she didn't know. When we walked back down, Nana said she was going to do something and then come to see the light. I was trying to work out what my power was. We got to the house. I got to the middle of the house and there was Ezra, Dad and I and some scary zombie-looking girl. The light appeared as a little squishy ball and it exploded. The 'camera' went bird's eye view and showed heaps of birds flying out of the forest."

I told them something and they got into this big plastic thing, which was a safety defense shield thing. Then I had to guess the code."

I printed them out and left them so he would see them. These girls gave me a fake number plate. I knew it was a fake, but I put it on a car that I had. They said the speed goes up to 39kph. The number plate was 80, which meant I was speeding. They went off and I got in the car with Mom. We had to go in the Hyundai and I had to sit in the back, which I complained about. Ezra wanted to see Species 3. Later I was talking to Graham and 'confronted' him about the pictures, but he said he didn't know. Headlines from back then, said stuff like 'Dead doctor' and stuff."

Food and stuff was really hard to get, but the place that I was at had a little shop/shed thing with trolleys full of stuff and we could take them. Jayson, Ezra, Mom, Dad and Jayson' made up sister were there. Her name was Marie and she looked like Mary from Kingdom Hospital. She liked me a lot. Anyway, we went down to the shed and we got a trolley, which was ours and we had to climb to get it. When we walked out there were some people nearby and they were going to kill us, or at least damage us, but we ran away, this happened twice, and the third time there was this nice black guy who gave us our stuff and a diary of a girl who had died and disappeared. Then strange things started happening. As we were walking to this place, coming back from the shed, I was seeing everything in black and white, but everything behind me was in colour. We walked onto this platform and Marie started talking to me as her mother, and she told me that I had turned into her mother. This strange thing went away and when I was still like that I said ""No, it's me Izzy"" and she said ""Oh, Jayson' girlfriend"" and I said ""Who's girlfriend? I'm not a girlfriend"". She said something like ""It seems like it"". Jayson was in some place and he was skinny. Later on, I was on this jetty thing, and these guys were going to kill me and there was a 'magical' thing that happened and it happened now -- a bit of water rained from nowhere and I quickly ran to get away and a wave got the bad people. It also happened later, but this time I barely got away and it was a train that went past."

Anyway, they would search houses for people and kill them or take them with them. They were on our street and Dad told me to hide in his cupboard underneath all these clothes. I did, but then they got to our house and they took Dad and Ezra with them. One (I think only one came in) opened the cupboard, but he didn't see me, but he somehow sensed I was in there and I got up and was running away from him. He got sick of running, I suppose, and went back to the ship but I realized he was going to blow the house up, so I ran into the shed and then I heard an explosion. The house was still standing though. The predator bloke had a look and happy with the results, he left the house and told the rest not to search the house again. Then they flew away. I was going to jump the fence to leave, but there was an evil dog. I went next door and they were in a caravan thing and they were going to leave. I knocked on the door and I said it was us (Ezra was with me now). They didn't believe us, and this guy said ""What does Izzy like?"" So I said ""waffle, chicken"" and Ezra said ""guns"" and they said ok and let us in. The caravan was full of people and it was really squishy inside. Granma was in there. We got to a park and there were horse races and we tried to warn everyone about the aliens but no-one believed us."

Mom, Dad and Ezra were sitting next to the stage. I also knew Graham Chapman, who was appearing in this play. I don't know what they did, but at the end they were singing 'Every Sperm is Sacred' and I was the only one in the audience who knew the words. After, I went to see Mom who was talking to a sports teacher. She said ""You're the only kid I've met who likes Monty Python"". I was chatting to her and Mom and then the sports teacher said she liked the way I talk. Then in sport, she said she thought it would be best for me if I taught myself. Later, Johnny Knoxville and I went to a shop and stole another bottle of water and also we had ordered a cows brain and had eaten a little bit of it as a joke."

There was also a boy, who was a serious computer addict. He lived in this room, which was stacked high with games and other computer things. We went to the big caravan, which was messy. I went to the bedroom and turned around and screamed. A room on the left side had been one which I had dreamed the Zelda person (The lady from 217 in The Shining remake) was in and I was seeing things. It was really scary.

If this bird cuckooed then we won heaps of money. We climbed up and after a certain time, it makes you fall. Terry Jones was running the whole show, but he was also climbing, so I think maybe he had a look-alike. He was falling and somehow I pressed mine and his button thing, not at the same time. I won $1.4 million. Then I was playing Neopets and it was money that I had on there. Then I had it in real life again."

Graham went psycho, turning into a zombie and then eventually calming down. He ended up dying. I also remember that when people bit someone's finger, they would turn into a zombie.

It was then not wet, and it was all sunny and stuff. There were a few people around, but they were shady looking. This person and I jumped on a hovercraft thing, as did Ezra and Jayson and then the shady people started shooting at us. We got pretty far and then the hovercraft stopped.

A dog attacked me and Tigger. We all liked this robot guy heaps. He had to go and not come back. We had a path to the cemetery from our garage and people went through it all the time. It was Halloween and some boys were dared to stay there until 12.15. I went and people I knew were there. I went to a video shop, and Being John Malkovich was there. The robot came back for a short visit. At this person's house they left a light on for a little girl. This guy kept turning it off. The little girl was watching telly. Someone went into the bathroom."
"0468"	"None"	"(2005-12-15 (14)) Ryan Cartwright was in a movie which I had a video clip of? Daryl was in our class and sat at our group of desks. He was making a weird noise and I accidentally fell off my chair. He started laughing loudly. We then had an assembly and he and Tiana said ""Don't leave,"" when I moved away. There were zombies. I pretended to be a zombie and when I thought I was close enough to safety I started running. One said ""There she is!"" and they started chasing me, but I made it to shelter. A professor died trying to close the door. I ran down stairs and people from school there. The light was a pretty blue colour. There was some movie with mice and rats. Zack (Saved by the Bell) and a girl were there. He swore and then turned to camera and said ""Did I just swear?""."
"0469"	"None"	"(2005-12-17 (14)) We were at a hotel thing. There was a playground in it and it was really colourful. I went up a slide and fell back down. It was snowing and there were tornado's everywhere. I went up all the stairs to this room with Calvin and two other people but it was stingy so we went back to the hotel. On floor 9, people wouldn't let us in unless we paid them with matchsticks."
"0470"	"None"	"(2005-12-20 (14)) I was really young and we were at some place on hills. These bad people had Mom captive. Granma, Uncle Gabriel, a girl my age (I was about 4 in the dream) and I went into tunnels. Granma and the girl went in first. Uncle Gabriel and I ended up at this door with beanbags next to it. There was a big guy. The door opened and a girl ran out and we hid. Uncle Gabriel went to go in but I thought it was a trap and then the same girl ran out again, I realized that she was a hologram and I went to warn him but it too late and this woman took him. I ran back down the tunnels and remembered another tunnel. There was a game and there were gems throughout worth $9 each. The girl was in the captain's room. Something changed. There were Yoshi or Bone characters and at this hospital they turned invisible."
"0471"	"None"	"(2005-12-22 (14)) I got a video of 'The Murder of John Lennon'. It was different from what actually happened though. It was all real video and everything had been taped. There was a part of the movie about these people from the future. One of them was bad at math, but was good with decimals. They knew that he was getting killed on 8th December at 8.00pm though it changed to 10.00pm. They were out partying and they got reminded of saving him ten minutes before it was going to happen. John Lennon was taped talking to people after he had just got off a boat and it was daytime. Then shown was John signing Mark David Chapman's book to 'Peter Milk'. Then he came back later and one of the people there cried out ""Look out!"". He mumbled it as if questioning it and then turned around to see Chapman standing there with his hand in his jacket. It was cold and you could see their breath. He pulled out a gun and said ""I may be gay but you are great,"" and as John turned to run he shot him and he said ""I'm shot,"" and collapsed on the stairs [when he fell the camera was actually him falling, like in A Clockwork Orange when Alex jumps out the window] . The stairs he collapsed on came down upon each other and John got squished. By the time, Yoko Ono and the others got there he was long gone. His feet were sticking out and the last part showed Chapman going through files about him. I was watching it with Mom and our eyes were both teary. She went away and I watched it again. I was really upset and crying. Mom said ""I understand but get over it"". [I woke up from this dream crying, and was really depressed for the whole day.] Later I was somewhere else and this dude asked if anyone liked any celebrities that had died before we were born. Mom said ""She [me] does!"" and he asked me when. I said ""Ten years, four months after August 7 1970"" and he couldn't work it out. He was the decimal dude."

I can't remember the first time, but the next time was at the girl's house. We ran up to the top floor attic thing. And they had sex. The girl ran down as we were walking. She mouthed 'barbie' and her father said something about sausages. I called Mom to pick me up. The guy fell down in an elevator. I couldn't find the lid for the water bottle."

They said they were going to be there and George had pyjamas, a marker etc. I talked to them for a while and then I ran to shops for some paper but none of the shops had any and these bridges were delayed, and I needed to use the bridges to get from place to place. I finally got to a hotel and it was the wrong one and there was an evil person. Dad was in the pool. I got keys. The Beatles had gone when I got back."

There were big waves and me and two guys climbed this thing, but when we got to the top, the wave was gone. We went into this 'building'. We sat in chairs and this guy whistled and a wave came over. My ears felt funny. We had to move as other people were getting seated. The chairs were really comfy. There was a whistle, and then an earthquake. Some people were testing out weapons which were causing the waves and earthquakes. We had to keep moving. Orlando Bloom was there?"

He tore the sides off. He was asked to get a new cover for The Evil Dead by 9am and I told him about some computer place where he could do it. We had to work there.
