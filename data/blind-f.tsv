"101-01"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-01 (F-A-T-19/27) I was at my parent's house that I grew up in and I was going out with a friend that I have here. I saw the house in fairly clear detail as if I were seeing it, and I went out with my friend to her house which was another large place with a lot of stairs. Again there were a lot of visual details. I could see a lot of colors in the rooms, the colors of the carpeting and the furniture and all the different shapes and different lighting as we moved from room to room, and she and I were talking, I don't remember what about, and I got to the top of a long flight of stairs inside the house and I was looking around and I said to her something like I forgot to close, to lock the front door of my house and that I had better go. And I had forgotten to lock the door of my house, but mostly I just wanted to go home, so we went back down this really long flight of stairs, and I don't remember if I had my brace on, that I wear, or not, just for some reason I was focusing on the stairs a lot. She does in fact have a long flight of stairs leading into her house, but they are outside not inside."
"101-02"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-02 (F-A-T-19/27) I was back in the house that I grew up in and there was a child there who I was supposed to be looking after, who appeared to be 5 or 6 maybe. Who didn't appear to like me very much. Then again, the visuals on the house appeared to be very clear and although I could see the child... not with any clarity, just sort of a vague form, but I can't recall any facial features, I could hear her voice and the inflections of her voice, she didn't come very close to me. I don't remember particularly what I said to her but just remembered feeling very awkward which I guess I do around most children, in any case... at one point I was going out to get our family dog. To get our dog we used to have to go through the kitchen, into the garage, out back to where he was tied up. So I left the child in the house and went out to get the dog, I came back in and the child was sitting at the dining room table, and I could see her there, vaguely, and I could hear her talking to my sister who was sitting with her and they were coloring and I was somewhat relieved that my sister was with her because my sister was always much better with children, but I had also felt somewhat hurt that the child would sit with her and play with her but not with me."
"101-03"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-03 (F-A-T-19/27) Right before waking up I remember standing in the kitchen of that house and my mother and my grandmother were there, that is my mother and her mother and my mother asked; ""what would you like to do, go for a walk or go using your wheel chair?"" And I was somewhat anxious about going at all, I really didn't want to leave the house, but I thought to myself that it would be easier to use the wheelchair, but I needed the exercise so ""I guess I'll walk"" I said to my mom, ""I guess I'll walk."" And I was looking in the refrigerator while I was waiting for my grandmother to be ready to go, because my grandmother was also going to go on the walk with me. I was looking in it and seeing the different foods, and the light, the way it came on in our fridge when I was younger and I could still see. And people were talking, I don't remember who exactly, but they were discussing a recipe which sounded especially unappealing to me, something about some low fat chicken parts or something and my mom was talking about replacing that with beef and how it didn't work very well."
"101-04"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-04 (F-A-T-19/27) Last night I dreamed that I went back to school, to college, and I was moving into my dorm room and all my friends were still there, moving into their rooms, there was a lot of noise, a lot of people moving around, it was moving day. My suite-mate L was there, my friend J. I could see the room, the color of the carpeting, just the lighting and all that, the way I had always seen it in my head when I lived there, and I had been asleep and I woke up and this woman, actually two women came into the room, some of my friends were in the room too. And these women were telling me that I had to move all my stuff out, because they had a housing shortage and in the housing lottery I had drawn a place to live, but it was a tent in the parking lot and I was really, really upset because it was going to be winter soon and it was getting to be cold, and besides, I was in the room that I had been in all along and it was nice and I wanted to stay there and I told them: ""Look, you better see what you can do because I'm arthritic and I can't live outside, even in a tent, especially in winter I just can't."" And they were just basically saying, ""well that's just tough luck"" and I said ""You know I realize that, but I just can't live under those conditions and I'll transfer out of this school but"" I said, ""in the mean time I'm going to sue you for discrimination if you keep this up and force me to transfer"". And they began to get really annoyed and silent and sullen at that point I could see them vaguely, I couldn't see their faces, one was sort of heavy set and shorter and the other was taller and a tiny bit overweight. One was wearing a white cotton sweater, I can't remember what the other was wearing. I also remember something else which might have been part of another dream."
"101-05"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-05 (F-A-T-19/27) There was a book published, like a book of essays and the authors of these particular, essays were going to get together and do a public reading of the book, each author was going to read their one of their essays that were in the book. And I had several essays in the book and I was trying to decide which one to read. Only I was reading it in print, I was, I had to get fairly close to the page, the way I had to when I was younger to see the print, but I was reading the print book. I was trying to select an essay and I was reading bits and pieces of different essays and trying to decide. I was in I guess it was some sort of conference room, I wasn't sure what kind of room it was, it had a sort of very thick, plush, maroon carpet and large tables and really big windows. It was a really huge room."
"101-06"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-06 (F-A-T-19/27) I had a weird sort of dream, I was stuck somewhere, in a doctor's office, like in an exam room, waiting for a long time and then I left. The whole office had a sort of maroon carpeting and looked like it had been a really big house at some point or something and then I walked out of the exam, the whole office, I was wandering around this big long hall and it was carpeted the same way and it had big huge windows lining the whole hall I think on both sides, and it looked kind of late out, not like real sunny and I guess I was there a really long time because a nurse came out from the doctor's office and said that I'd been there a really long time and did I have a ride home, and I suddenly realized that I didn't, that I hadn't made arrangements with the patient transport [company] to go home and that it was after 5 and I couldn't and besides, I needed 24 hours notice. And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend ""I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone"" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said ""there's a phone right here"". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, ""nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here"" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying ""I want to go home, I want to go home"" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought that she was thinking that I was crazy for acting like a little kid."
"101-07"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-07 (F-A-T-19/27) [1997-05-08] I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said ""no""... I was supposed to fly home and it was much later than I thought, and I felt really bad because I hadn't called my parents. I was walking everywhere in the house, looking for a phone."
"101-08"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-08 (F-A-T-19/27) [1997-05-09] I had a dream I was in a mall and I was shopping with my friend X from S [the club] and this guy who was with X but I don't think it was her husband. I was in a wheel chair and so was she and we were going through this store. A section of the store with lots of clothes. It wasn't all a clothes store and it had sort of the usual mall kind of lighting. And it was quiet, not too quiet, like the store was carpeted so it was not too echoey in there. For some reason I decided to walk to the next store, I was walking with my sister and we were in the next store and walking around and I realized that I left my wheel chair in the last store and someone went back to get it and then somehow we ended up, X and I were parked next to the front of the store where it goes into the mall, like this really wide area, we were just parked there in our wheelchairs and this guy who was with X, and so was my sister, said something to X and she said something back like ""we'll talk about it later"" and she sounded like a little kid. And I said ""okay"". And the guy said something to us like, ""you know, you two used to be so normal until you started hanging out together."" And I realized I was sucking on my hand like a little kid and I took my hand out of my mouth and felt really stupid. And X said ""You should be glad, at least we survived""."
"101-09"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-09 (F-A-T-19/27) I was in my old high school and I was sitting at a table in the hallway, guess no classes were in session. It was just a regular school table, I could see everything, the lockers and the doors, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table. I could see the yellowy track lighting that most schools have and I had a bunch of papers, I'm not sure what I was doing at this table, or doing back in high school, I graduated in '88, but I was back and was supposed to be back in classes, and the bell rang, so I took all my stuff off the table and I called Oval, my guide dog and I realized that I forgot to put her in harness, so she had no harness and no leash, and there was no way she could guide me and I had no idea which class I was supposed to go to next, but I knew that I was really, really behind in all my classes. So I went to the room that I used to go to where I had all of my books and my Braille equipment and stuff so I went to the room with her and closed the door. And it was a real mess in there, there was junk everywhere, like it had been there for a really long time. There were textbooks everywhere, it was dark, there were no lights. So I turned on a radio, and I was looking through some of my books and just feeling completely confused and overwhelmed and I knew that I must have been failing nearly everything. Some guy came into the room and he sat down besides me and he said something to the effect of ""we've been discussing you and we think that you ought to go home"" and I said ""why?"" and he said because none of the other students can just retreat to there little room. They don't have a little room like this. Everyone else has to go to the cafeteria and study and everybody is always so sympathetic to you and no one else gets breaks like you do and its unfair to the other students and you should go home"". While he was talking to me he put his arms around me like I was a little kid and he apologized for upsetting me. Something about him having issues of his own. The principal came in and he looked at us and then he left."
"101-10"	"(F-A-T-19/27)"	"#101-10 (F-A-T-19/27) I was with my best friend, X and we were preparing for a 3 day weekend, like Friday, Saturday and Sunday only all I had with me was my backpack and I hadn't packed anything. We went to the kitchen and we chatted for a while and then we went into this huge bedroom. It had several king-sized or queen-sized beds scattered around the room. Lots of big windows, high up. It was really light or white in there. I was really agitated because I'd forgotten my medication, so she called her doctor and I was listening on another phone, and she asked him if he could get her some medication for while I was there and he said to her ""I'm really glad you called, X, I'm really concerned about your blood work"" and he talked to her about it. I pulled the phone away from my ear and thought that it might be a bad thing to listen or by listening something bad would occur. I went back out to the kitchen which was small and dark and confining. Like it was paneled with some kind of dark wood. And her 2 kids were there, in there 20's and they kept looking at me like I was something really strange and they wouldn't talk to me so I went back to the bedroom, feeling stupid for not packing anything. And suddenly there was my family, having a party in the kitchen, where I was hiding away from. This guy from a soap opera I watch, showed up and he like picked me up and put me on the bed and pinned me down and I wasn't scared, he didn't do it in a hostile way. He sort of pinned me down in a sexual domination kind of thing. I went back out to the kitchen and then the patio and there were some people there I didn't know, and I didn't want to be outside, but I didn't want to be inside by myself either, so I went outside. And no one even knew that I was there. That's it."
"102-01"	"(F-C-T-32/32)"	"#102-01 (F-C-T-32/32) Last night I dreamed that I was talking to a person who is bringing her cat over today for a visit before she leaves him with me in his new home. The dream was really similar to our last conversation in terms of arranging the time that he was to visit, but then she asked me if I had plenty of toys and I felt disappointed because she had told me previously the cat was a quiet cat and not very playful and I said 'yes I do, but I thought that you said that he's not too playful'. That's where the dream ended"
"102-02"	"(F-C-T-32/32)"	"#102-02 (F-C-T-32/32) I dreamed that a friend of mine gave me 500 dollars and took me shopping. We went into a department store and I picked out a pair of jeans and a pair of pajamas which were really fleecy the dream immediately switched over to my community chorus where one of the members told me that an older member had recently been committed to a nursing home, this is someone who is lively and fun to be with and I said 'oh that's too bad!'"
"102-03"	"(F-C-T-32/32)"	"#102-03 (F-C-T-32/32) I dreamed that I was coming out of the upstairs bathroom in my parents house and as I was standing out in the hallway, listening, I heard the TV blaring, and it was a news magazine like 20/20 and the topic was Job Searching. I groaned inwardly and thought 'oh great, here we go again' because now my parents were going to bring up the whole issue of finding a job. And I don't want to discuss it."
"102-04"	"(F-C-T-32/32)"	"#102-04 (F-C-T-32/32) I had a dream that I was standing in a rehearsal of my community chorus for a concert and we were dancing as we were singing a mellow Carpenters number and I was relieved to find that I was following everyone else's movements and not out of step with them. Our conductor asked a friend of mine, R, a recovering anorexic, to stand up and speak some words about the disorder in the middle of a song, but she never got up and because I didn't hear her speak I thought to myself: ""why is she not getting up?"" and speaking the way she's supposed to be."
"102-05"	"(F-C-T-32/32)"	"#102-05 (F-C-T-32/32) I dreamed that I had emptied my cat litter box. The cardboard box that was rectangular and had the cat litter in it also had a small spout on the side that you could pour the cat litter out of and when I came out of the bathroom where I had been doing this, my mother, who had come over to the house said: ""that was laundry soap that you put in there, not cat litter""."

I said to her ""That's not macaroni and cheese that's noodles and sauce"" and then I put it back in the cupboard."

Its not in there, why are we singing this again, we just sang it last Christmas , this isn't appropriate for spring"" and yet on second thought, I said, ""Well, we'll be able to hear Tracy and Jenny sing again during the solos so that'll be good""."

We got there and it was the auditorium of a local high school and we sat down in the upholstered chairs of the auditorium. There was no one there yet and I thought ""Why isn't anybody here?"". LS went to find out why there wasn't anybody there and when the service would start. So she went off to find some information, and while my mom and I sat there I took out a box of Snackwell's crackers, that were spiced with pepper and we started to eat and I thought ""Why are we doing this, these are supposed to go to my dad for Father's Day"" and I felt intensely guilty for bingeing on the crackers that were earmarked for a present. And then, as I sat there eating, I heard at the back of the room on someone's boom box, an evangelical broadcast and thought to my self, ""why aren't we doing this, we're supposed to be having a service and we're not doing it, here I am listening to the radio and its got this religious broadcast, and we're supposed to be doing this and why aren't we and why aren't there anybody here? Where is LS and why hasn't she come back?"""

I said ""well that's good, he should be more suited for the job than I am"" so I was glad that he got the job and not me.

When I got home, instead of entering through the front door, I entered through the basement door and heard some commotion going on upstairs, some people talking and bustling around and I wondered what was going on. But I turned around, and after setting my vests down went outside because I knew that I had some friends from church waiting to take me to an outing in the afternoon and yet I couldn't resist finding out who was upstairs and why and so I turned back around, went back inside, closed the doors and went upstairs and discovered it was my parents putting up stair treads that they had planned to put up sometime this year and had never gotten to. They were also painting, which I didn't expect them to do. I asked them about it and they said ""oh, we're just here, doing a lot of stuff this afternoon"" and I said ""well that's all right, but I'm not going to be here this afternoon, I'm going back out to a church function"" and they said ""well that's all right, we don't need you here but can we make tuna fish sandwiches for this afternoon when we break?""

And she told me to open my gift and I did and there were 2 place mats. I don't know how they fit into that small box but there they were. One end of the place mats was beautifully cross-stitched, they were Irish linen and the cross stitching was green and black, the linen was an unbleached color like a muslin, they were not very pretty but she was so pleased that I told her they were just lovely."

It was empty in back, it was just like a dumptruck in back. No hoses, no ladders, no Indian tanks, no equipment at all, but there were 3 or 4 men in the back of it. The cab was immense, it was like the truckers' rigs that you see now, like they're carrying a living room with them. One of the men said, ""I bet there are no peanuts on the floor in the front."" I don't know what he meant but that's what he said. And the rescue unit went by and when it did, by now I was sitting down, and when it went by it rattled whatever I was sitting on so badly that my head got bumped several times."

I opened the box and inside were 6 bars of soap. So pretty, so lovely, and they were interspersed with designs between them. They were not neatly arranged, just random, with no pattern and I wanted so desperately to buy that box of soaps because I love nice soaps and I kept looking at the price tag and I couldn't see the price and I knew they were expensive and so I didn't buy the box of soap. I believe they were blue, a pale blue, and the designs which lay between the niches had roses and other flowers, pink roses and yellow roses and blue flowers and green leaves and just really pretty box of soap."

I had on my woolen winter coat which goes below mid-calf and its a very comfortable coat, but its awkward and heavy. And the wind was blowing and it was raining all of a sudden the man with me said ""Run P! That car is chasing us!"" We began to run, and it was very difficult for me in that coat and I tripped and stumbled, I didn't fall and the man grabbed my arm and pushed me up against a tree. He said, ""stand there with your back to the road and he won't be able to see us.""

We came in and she was getting something out of a cupboard. She was wearing a bright red dress, and she has very short, very black hair and very trim, neat little figure and this bright red dress just enhanced her looks and all of a sudden a great big dog came around the corner and F said ""oh, I brought my dog"" and the dog came up to me and rubbed against me and I said to it ""oh I bet you're hungry, I bet you haven't been fed"". I had a can of dog food in the refrigerator, opened, with part of it taken out, I have no idea where that came from because I don't have a dog. I can remember saying to them, that I'm really not much of an animal lover, but this is a beautiful dog. I turned around and we chatted and I made plans to go up to the VA hospital, and I asked if we could stop and eat breakfast along the way and the answer was a very solid ""No, we won't have time"" and I was bitterly disappointed."

I felt completely attractive and as though I fully deserved the affections of this young man, who's name I do not know. We went many places together and did many things together. He would hold my hand whenever we were walking, and if we were in a room, he would involuntarily hold me in his arms and caress me, my hair, and kiss me but very dispassionately. There were no sexual implications at all. In this particular part of the dream I was getting dressed to go out with him somewhere and he came into the room while I was getting dressed and I said ""don't come in, I'm getting dressed"" and he came in and said that we were going to go to this house on the outskirts of town, and I said ""all right, I'll be ready in just a few minutes"" and he left and my son came in and talked to me about something and whatever it was didn't make much sense and he left, and the strange thing was that my son was his age, 39, but I was still the ""younger woman"". Eventually I got dressed. I had showered and done all the feminine things, the deodorant, the cologne and so forth and met the young man and walked hand in hand for quite a distance, to a beautiful street where there were all theses old sea captains houses, like we have on the coast of Maine. The street was lined with these houses on both sides of the street and we walked by many of them and finally came to one that was more like a southern plantation with the pillars in the front supporting a balcony. And we went around to the side of this house and we entered a door and climbed a flight of stairs and there was a door at the top and he had a key which unlocked the door, and we walked into a room with very high ceiling, no carpet on the floor, but an ugly brown chair, and an ugly blue chair... I don't remember any draperies, and there was a big old television set in one corner, obviously an old, black and white and he led me through a door into another room, which was totally unfurnished, it was quite a maze of rooms actually, all empty of furnishings except that first one. There was pealing paint on the walls which I believe were painted white, but that's not very vivid now, and he left me to go somewhere and a friend of his came in and asked me how I like the apartment and I said that it could be very nice if it was fixed up and a couple, a man and a woman, presumably his wife, and a little boy came in and walked into another room, which I assumed was a bedroom, they were very, very tired, and they put the boy to bed in another small bedroom, and they disappeared and I can't describe them to you, and I stood in a hall and leaned up against a wall, and I was very nicely dressed, I had on black panty hose, and nice black shoes, a dark gray skirt with a black sweater, some earrings and I felt as though I looked very nice. And across from this hallway there was good-sized hole in the wall, 6 or 8 inches in diameter and down the floor came a good sized spider, and I am deathly afraid of spiders, and I just cringed up against this wall and shouted to this friend of my friend to please come and kill this spider and he said ""get real, I don't like them, I'm afraid of spiders too"". So he didn't come to help me and the spider just came closer on the opposite side and he tried his best to dig his way in under the wall. He couldn't, and he only had 4 legs. And he had an oval, red patch on his back, but when he climbed the wall to get up to this hole, it turned to be gray and fuzzy. And when it looked in this hole and then tilted down, clinging to the rim of this hole with his back legs, and when he lurched up and he had a very small mouse in it's 2 front legs and he tipped the mouse up and opened his mouth and the blood ran out of the mouse's mouth and into his. And I began to gag and retch and thankfully woke up."

His was like a felt hat that men wear in the winter but it was made of straw and it was on top of my hat, and apparently this was a very sexual thing to him because he turned to look at me and he said ""I know why you did that"" and there was a sexual tension in the air and you (the researcher) walked into the room and looked at us and looked at the 2 hats and began to laugh."

I didn't have a duplicator and so it was really funny, I had to take 2 tape recorders, my little one and a larger one and I had them laid out on the floor, on the rug, in the living room of my apartment that I used to have way back in 1983. I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too. I wasn't sure what else I was doing, using some machine or something, but I had this idea that I had to keep busy and so I was sitting at the desk between the 2 tape recorders and trying to do another task with it so I could keep working."

I walked into the work area and asked if someone could give me a ride because I didn't think that it was all right for me to walk home even though I felt pretty good, I didn't think that it was a good idea and they said, a lady, I think it was one of my drivers, she said ""well we don't know if we can do that, we have to get approval first from somebody else"".

And I knew that my father didn't want to go and I said, ""yeah I know, but at least they're both together and at least if we're going to one we might as well go to the other one as well. When we got there, we had to climb up a lot of flights of stairs because my aunt lived in the building but we had to climb up to the fifth floor, it was the same house that we visited a long, long time ago. I could feel the stairs under my feet, the so I knew we were climbing up the same stairs. I don't know how, but somehow I had also arrived in a cab too inside my parents were not there but I do not remember the weddings, somehow it jumped and we were at my parents' house having a big party and there were people there and they were all eating different things, and my brother in law was there too and we were all talking animatedly and I can remembered eating grinders. My brother in law had to leave in the middle and I could hear him going up the stairs to his house to the second floor and I was entertaining a lot of the people when he left. And then some other person came in, a relative of one of the people at the party, and we were all having a big dinner and talking and enjoying it, we were all happy and I can't remember some of the conversations but we were all talking, and I can't remember what time of day it was, exactly."

And then we were at the Redwood school where I went when I was really little for that pool part of the dream and then we were in my house and people had come to my house and there were kids and they went into my pocket book and they moved all my stuff around and I was trying to figure out what they had done, and they took my signature guide and they took the top off of it so that I couldn't use it anymore and I wasn't very happy about that and I told them that. I noticed that on the signature guide the top was missing one corner so that it didn't go straight across and it wasn't a rectangle anymore, and I was trying to figure out what they were doing and why they were messing up all of my stuff. In the middle of it, one of my client's case records were on my bed too, all my Braille notes to them, not the print ones and I was looking at them and reading them and going through them and figuring out what was going on with that."

I was giving out some ceramic mugs to my aunt F and others that I can't remember. And then we were at a school and an atheist friend that I have was going to be reading the Christmas story and so we were all supposed to go down to listen to him, they made the announcement over some kind of PA system, that we should go down and listen to him, but I thought that doesn't seem right because he doesn't believe in God and in Christians and I didn't want to go because it would be kind of hypocritical to be there unless he's changed and I thought its kind of weird and so I stayed in another room, I don't know exactly what was in there, there was a wooden floor, there was no carpeting where I was. I had a Braille copy of the Christmas story, just a few pages like they were torn out of a magazine. It looked like computer paper and it was all folded up and I was trying to find how it was arranged so I could find the top. I was riffling through the pages with my hand trying to figure out how it was arranged so that I could find the beginning. Then we were in a car, looking for something to eat, my driver B (male) was driving us and we were hungry and we stopped in this restaurant and there were people waiting on us that were [unclear] and these girls were waiting on us but they weren't happy doing it or they didn't know what they were doing and there was confusion. There were wooden tables that we were sitting at and we never really ate though because the girl that was waiting on us was doing different things and so I don't remember eating even though we were in there.

Its tall and it makes it hard for me to hear the traffic because its tall and is blocking the sound. But somehow there's a way that I can talk to a police person who is up there working, I'm not sure how, I had a radio or something, And I could hear the police person at work talking about this situation so we talked each other through it and then the police person is there at work, putting in paper work for different things that have to be done.

And somehow we all ended up going to a party and there was a whole lot of us there, many of the people were also members of the Idaho Counsel of the Blind, which I am a member of and we were eating. We all had these bags of food and I was reaching in and grasping with my fingers, little mandarin orange sections and eating them and they tasted really nice and juicy and there was a candy bar but the candy bar felt different it had like a cut out rectangle on one side and it was flat like a regular candy bar on the other side and the rectangle felt like the whole shape of the whole candy bar, like a border on one side, raised up about a quarter of an inch. And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said ""oh, I've never had one of these before"" and I ate it and it was good. We were all eating and I was eating a lot more than I had wanted to and I remember thinking, 'gee I shouldn't be eating all of this its too much' but I kept on eating anyway. We were celebrating S's birthday, he's the head of a magazine I get on tape, and I got to meet him once at a convention, and he wasn't at the party, which didn't matter, we were still celebrating his birthday anyway. The A was talking to one of the other people at the party and telling her that she really didn't want to do something that this other person wanted her to do, and that was unusual I thought, because A doesn't usually complain. About stuff. And I thought, that's good, because if she really doesn't want to do it then she shouldn't do it just because the person who's asking is blind and she's sighted."

I look at my watch, it says ten minutes to seven, and I think about the people and I think I better get up and go downstairs. I again look at my Braille watch and there's a third hand in it and the third hand makes it read like its 4:00, but then this other hand makes it look like ten to seven and so I'm not sure if its ten of seven or 4:00 and I said, ""I don't remember there being a second hand on my watch"". I went down stairs and I asked if anybody was going to cook anything and nobody wanted to do anything and my sister was there and she said ""well I don't know"", but I was hungry and I was wondering if we should call out and get some food delivered, but I was also thinking of cooking, but I couldn't decide what to do so I said ""I'm going to bed"". So I went to bed and I was trying to sleep and I was trying to wake up and I was so tired. When I touched my dog, there was like a pocket on her, a shallow slide pocket where you would hide something very thin in, it was made of fur, but when I put my hand in it it didn't seem to bother her and I thought this was pretty strange to see this on my dog, it didn't seem like an injury to her and I couldn't figure that out.

Then there was this console in front of us with 4 switches on it. You turn them to the right and you can hear people talking about different things. They were all talking about businesses and you had to decide whether their business was solvable or soluble or worth getting involved in. And I said to one of them, ""no that's just not going to work"", it was somehow connected with the Idaho Counsel of the Blind. There were people there from other states and they were talking about their businesses and we said, ""no that's not going to work"".

So I was working in my dream and I said ""oh, well, I better get this form done for Q by September 30th because they have to have it by the end of the fiscal year"".

So then we stayed there for a while and went right back home again, back to the other lady's house and we just talked. I don't remember much about the conversation.

In the middle of the runway were these great big, structures made of a like Tinker Toy material almost four feet high. You could take your hand and grasp these pegs, these things and take them apart. And they said, ""and you guys gotta help out because we only have 10 minutes to get this runway clear because there's going to be a lot of people coming through here, we've got to get these things taken apart."" I pulled on one and it came apart pretty easily. So first I was at one end of these things trying to help out, and there were a lot of others helping too, some ladies that are head consultants that work with us. And to my surprise, I pulled on the Tinker Toy-like peg and it came out of the 2 ends it was connected on, and it came off the structure pretty easily, but I didn't have anything to put them in, so I had about 4 or 5 of them in my hands and I was trying to figure out where to put them. I started out at one end, couldn't figure out where to put them and then I went to the other end, see how long it is, how much progress people are making with this thing.

I had been sent there by my agency to find out if they were wasting the money we spent there for clients we sent there. For instance were they saying that our clients needed more services and not delivering them but only using the money for their own gain? So I was kind of like an investigative reporter. When I was told I had to go I felt kind of strange because I hadn't done that kind of work before and I told my supervisor I don't want to do this, I'm not the qualified person to do this job. He said ""you're exactly what we need because nobody will suspect you. In fact we're going to send you as we would a client except you're going to be taking all these notes and asking all these questions and they won't suspect you. Well, I thought about it and I said to him; ""All of this will be a challenge, where am I going?"" And he said not to the nearby rehab center in Pennsylvania, I was kind of hoping for that one because that's where the Philadelphia Flyers were. He said I know you like hockey, but we're not sending you there and we're not sending you anywhere on the East coast. We're sending you out to Little Rock Arkansas. And I said ""Little Rock, Arkansas! The center out there? Its hot and humid here in the summer and you're going to send me out there? "" He said, that's what we've decided to do, Mr. Flip, the head of the agency has selected you to go and they gave me the airplane tickets. I recall calling the cab and taking a ride to Dunkirk Airport, which is always a hectic airport to go into and I talked to Sammy, I was saying to her, ""now Sammy, I know you don't like to fly, it always makes you a little nervous when we take off and land, once we get up there I know you're okay, but you always get a ,little nervous so you relax."" And I petted her and I reached into my purse and gave her a Milkbone dog biscuit and we flew to Little Rock and they announced the plane was landing and I woke up."

Small ones that played little tunes, and the ones I've always wanted to listen to and maybe buy, the big antique music boxes that had these disks that you could play and have several different tunes on them. I was just listening to those music boxes letting the music kind of surround me and hear the different sounds, the bell-like sounds, the different kinds of music box sounds you can hear... and not only did this shop have music boxes, but it also had all kinds of great things that had music inside them. They had musical clocks, it had a music clock that had a talking announcement before the time of alarm in the morning. It talked so that I could set the alarm myself. They had a radio which gave you the choice of regular music and music box music. There were just all kinds of music boxes there. I reached into my purse because I decided that I wanted to buy some of the music boxes and nothing was inside there, no money and no credit cards to pay for them. I woke up feeling kind of ridiculous."

It has a little tiny drawer inside and I have another table with a telephone on it and a few things like that. I was sitting on a chair on one side of my bed and I heard this voice and this person, this voice said to me ""How would you like to be able to fly whenever you wanted to?"" I said ""That sounds kind of interesting, different, but first of all who are you?"" And the voice said ""My name is Flora."" And I said ""How am I supposed to fly if I can't tell where I'm going?"" And she said ""Well, you can just say where you want to go and you'll get there."" And that sounded kind of neat, that would save all my transportation problems and I could choose whenever I wanted to do this. So I asked what I needed to do. She handed me this can that smelled like it had had baby powder in it. She said ""Just sprinkle some of it on your arms."" So I did and she told me, ""Just flap them."" I did and the next thing I knew was that I had flown out of my room and down the stairs and I was in my livingroom. So I thought this was kind of fun, and I realized that I was getting pretty low on groceries I think I'd like to go grocery shopping so as I was about to go I asked ""How am I supposed to take my guide dog with me?"" She said ""Put a little of that powder on your guide dog too and hold onto the harness, flap an arm and hold onto the leash and the dog will come up with you."" So I decided okay, sounds good to me, we started out. We stepped outside, closed the door, locked it stepped down and didn't say ""forward Sammy."" I said ""We're going to do something different and I took her leash and flapped my arms, we went up in the air and I was thinking, I want to go to Shop and Save, they've got good buys there, so off we went. The next thing I knew, I was in the grocery store, but I forgot to ask how I was supposed to manage after I got the groceries."

You need to go to a treatment place and I'll help you get there"" and she said ""Okay but I can't do it by myself"" and I said ""I know you can't and that's why we're here and that's why we've always been here when you've gone through the different programs.""

I ran down the stairs in my [indecipherable] and I checked the front door and yelled her name and I ran to the back door and called her again and I thought, ""She's right, she's far far away and I can't find her.

We were reading Shakespeare and my books on tape hadn't come. I had a small tape recorder with a built in mic in my hand and the tape was moving, I could hear the motor and feel it moving.

And I was just walking by myself, no one else was around, I was walking, my guide dog was with me, and we were just going through the woods. We passed a little brook and I listened to the rippling sound of the water and decided to sit down because there was a tree there and it was shady and I decided to take a rest. I fell asleep near the tree and then I woke up and continued on my way in the dream, and kept walking through the woods. I decided to go home, I looked at my Braille watch which was on my wrist and discovered it was afternoon, so I walked back home to my condo."

Sammy means a lot to me and I wouldn't do that to you."" They laughed and told me that I didn't need Sammy and they needed her more than I did. I told them that Sammy was trained to work just for me as are all guide dogs. And they said that she'd work for us or they'd kill her.

I walked down to the beach with Sammy and my sister and my 3 little nephews. I could smell the salt air and I could hear the ocean's waves. I could hear the seagulls as they made that mournful cry, while they're either looking for pray or whatever seagulls do. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, on my shoulders. It felt warm, I kicked off my shoes and picked them up so that I would have them layer and began walking barefoot through the sand. I felt the warm sand between my toes and I felt happy, until I heard a firecracker. The firecracker was awfully close to me and it was very loud, my ears were ringing, I was afraid Sammy had gotten hurt. Luckily the firecracker had missed me this time, but I jumped or jerked a little bit and woke up."

I was curious as to how this was happening since I hadn't turned it on or connected my speech synthesizer so the computer could talk to me or tell me what was on the screen. Actually there was nothing on the screen but the computer was speaking anyway. It asked me what I wanted and I said I would want to go anywhere that I needed to get to without having to ask other people. So it said, ""Okay, lets make a program so you can put down all of the places you usually have to get to."" And I started to argue with it and asked it all kinds of questions like ""how can all this be happening? I can't drive so what difference does it make if I make out a program?"" The computer told me not to be so doubtful. Just pick out the places on the program I wanted included. So I did and it was explained to me that I would tell my computer where I wanted to go and I would get there. I was pretty skeptical because a lot of these pie in the sky things don't work. So I said ""Okay, I want to go shopping at the little plaza where the Ames used to be, because there are a bunch of neat stores. Its also more fun to go with somebody and so I want to take Hilda (a blind friend) with me."" So I called her in my room, I grasped the telephone, and made a quick call and said ""lets go shopping, my computer just talked to me and I programmed it in to know that I wanted to go different places."" So we did this. I told the computer I wanted to go shopping top that little plaza, walked into the plaza, went into some of the different stores, the Radio Shack, the Card shop where you can buy all kinds of cards and little gifts, then we went to the bakery where we smelled the aroma of coffee cakes and cookies and all kinds of rich, fattening pastries. Then we went to the shoe store which isn't really there anymore but we went there anyway, and I bought some more shoes. Then there was a department store there and I found some more music boxes, so I bought some of those too. And we found a clothing store and Hilda wanted to buy some clothes, some new dresses and things so I decided to check out those too. And everybody was helpful. Then after we'd had enough shopping, I decided it was time to go home. I had my little palm top computer and I told it through a series of commands to tell my other computer that we needed to get home. A car came and we got home."

There were a bunch of little kids around, laughing, screaming, yelling and he was opening up his gifts. They opened up the gifts before the birthday cake because, he just was too anxious not to open the gifts first. Then we sang happy birthday and we had some birthday cake. We were out on the lawn of my brother and sister in law's house. Its a small yard but there was soft, green grass and there was enough room for all of us to sit down on the grass and eat the birthday cake. It was my favorite kind. It was chocolate cake with lots of rich, chocolate icing. My nephew got a present which he didn't like, it was a piece of jewelry and it was a heart pendant on a chain and he gave it to me and he said ""Gee, why don't you take that you like to wear those."" So I took it and tried it on and it was gold, it was very smooth, the chain was also very smooth with one of those little clasps on it, they call a lobster claw clasp that you open with your finger nail and slide the other clasp into it.

Any kind of loud clapping noise or banging noise like that. That low type sound bothers her. I was telling her to be a good girl and to stay on her rug, then we heard a really loud clap of thunder, the kind that sounds like it hit another object and it sounds like something might catch fire, its really loud and shakes everything and echoes through the air. Well, Sammy disobeyed me and leaped onto my bed, so I had about 70 pounds of dog on top of my stomach. I told her to get off my stomach, to get down, then she started to dig her little claws and paws into me to hold onto me. They were really sharp and it actually hurt a little bit. She wouldn't get down. I jerked awake to discover that it had been thundering and there was Sammy on top of my stomach and she wouldn't get down."

I had locked both the front and back doors, the windows were also closed because I had the air conditioner on and I couldn't figure out how anybody could be in there. But then I smelled meat frying in the kitchen and I heard people walking around and so I thought I'd better investigate. I put my slippers on, rubbed my eyes, threw on a robe and headed down the stairs very carefully, cause I felt like I was only half awake. I heard people talking in the kitchen and I said ""Who are you."" And a woman said, ""Well, we were here and my son and I were hungry and we wanted to have some meat, so I'm frying it in a pan with some eggs."" And I said ""I don't mind giving people some food, but I'd like to know how you got into my condominium."" And she said, well, we just touched the door and it was locked but we wiggled it a little more and it opened so we walked in."" So I asked her where she lived and she said ""Yeah, they had a house but it was too early to go grocery shopping and they just needed some food."" So I made some coffee in my drip coffee maker, cause I said to her, ""Well, as long as you're eating breakfast you might as well have some coffee too."" And I had some orange juice, so I gave her son and her some of that and then I washed the dishes. Then I said to her, ""Gee, you can't just go without having some other kind of food so I opened the lower kitchen cabinets where I keep all of my canned goods and I went through to find some goods that she could utilize and I also took out some macaroni from the upper cabinet, where I keep extra boxes of macaroni on hand, and I gave her some of that. I gave her a can of baked beans so she could mix that with the macaroni because the beans have tomato sauce on them and they can make a little supper. I gave her crackers and peanut butter because I knew that wouldn't spoil, I gave her some tuna fish, then I gave her some bread from the refrigerator so that she and her son could make sandwiches and some soda in cans. They thanked me and went out the door. This was so strange that when I woke up I actually went downstairs in my robe to check whether or not I had left the stove on."

They gave me this huge dog, I think the person said it was a ""Masty"" dog, but I believe the correct word is a Mastiff. It was a huge dog and I was disappointed because I didn't want a huge dog, they're hard when you take them on buses and things. I told the instructor. ""I really don't want that kind of dog.""

I was talking to the baby and I referred to her as ""Little Party Girl"" and I am sure I meant it as a word of endearment, Barbara's reaction was just completely baffling to me.

Our purpose for being there was that there was a meeting with a good sized committee that she and I would both be attending. But I also had the strong feeling that I wanted to talk to Betsy about other than political issues and it was one of those times when you knew you were going to be talking well into the night, like when you get together with an old friend and there's lots of catching up to do."

The scene changed then and I was at my daughter Robin's house. Where she was living in the dream was not her real house, it seemed that her house was a good sized house and for some reason my son and I had to walk home. We were in a very small entryway, I knew that I was going to be carrying something as we walked home. I don't know what it was but I knew it was going to be cumbersome and so would interfere with easy walking. I considered taking a bus. Anyway, my son, knowing that we were going to have to walk home, or because I had led him to believe so, he walked out the door and it was raining so I brought him back inside because I realized he was in his stocking feet. I bent down to help him find and put on his shoes and I felt that his little socks were wet naturally because he had stepped on wet ground. Then the scene changed again and however we got back here, we were back in our own apartment and there was someone here to visit and she was sitting on my son's bed. She is a very good friend of mine, a lady close to my age, and she greeted us and I knew by her voice who it was and I knew at the same time that I was thinking about my son's grandmother. In the background, in another room, a radio was playing. I also heard the phone ringing. The phone was on a wall, not where it really is in my kitchen.

But then I realized that the trash truck was already there and because of our method of pick-up which involves the hydraulic arms where they pick up the whole barrel and dump it into the truck, I was concerned that it would be unsafe for me to go over there and drop this box into the barrel.

I had a feeling this was a gang related thing. I had no clue; what we were supposed to have done, what they thought we had done, but he had placed 2 high stools, like the ones at my breakfast bar, up against a brick wall. Lindsy was already seated on hers, I was still standing, being given my instructions by this creep, who had handed us each, I don't know if these were packages of juice, made of a type of heavy duty foil paper, very good for like taking to a beach or something,. She already had hers and I was being handed mine, and hearing the instructions, however these 2 bags were filled with oil. We were being instructed to sit on these stools and drink this oil. I could hear Lindsy, it was terrible, out of fear or absolute obedience, was drinking this stuff down like a glass of water if you were thirsty. I could hear her swallowing and I remember thinking ""I can't drink this poison, its going to make me very sick."" Right after I heard her drinking, I heard this extremely violent vomiting, it was Lindsy, which then induced my own. I had raised mine to my lips but I never did take a drink of it. Thank goodness, the scene changed and I was in the same building, but in a higher level of it and I was in what felt like a very large, comfortable apartment that was mine. It was my living quarters. A neighbor had come over from across the hall telling me there was something on TV which I might enjoy watching and I said, ""Yes, that I would, thank you, I'll watch it on my own."" He became a little bit offended and wanted to know why and I said ""Because if I want to get up and fix myself a cup of coffee or something, I could."" The scene changed one more time and I was walking down, the same building, I left my apartment evidently, I was walking down a rather long corridor, and I was being careful, I was being careful because I didn't know what obstacles might be in the way. I reached the end of it and I went through a door and was on the outside of the building. Oddly, outside of the building, I felt counter tops that had cabinets underneath just like you would have in a kitchen, and I was opening them up to investigate, I found there were some dishes, some of which were perfectly empty. Everything was very dirty and I remember thinking ""What an absolute waste of good material, and why would anyone want to live like this out doors?""."

They seemed oriental I could hear their murmured voices, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because I do believe they were talking in their native tongue. I knew though, that these 2 boys had been brought there to be tortured before being killed. Now in the kitchen which was in front of me, there was another boy, and all of them seemed to be around the same age and I would guess, from the voices, 10 or 11 years old. The one in the kitchen didn't seem to be in any particular danger, he was just out there playing with a small sized ball I would say, a Ping-Pong ball or a superball or maybe he was just simply bouncing it around.

I was trying to turn these 2 switches on. The top one worked fine, the bottom one was defective. I got irritated, I knew there was a short in it but there was a female patient in my darkroom standing at the top part of the dryer which is like a counter top. She was standing there writing out the last of her wedding invitations. I wanted her to get out of my way. Also in that room was a device called a pass box. That's a lead lined box where the films, in their lead cases, were passed between the x-ray room and the darkroom so that they were totally safe from any light exposure. I reached my hand up, on top of this pass box for some reason and there was a whole stack of already done wedding invitations and then a friend of mine, Neal was there and I don't know what he was supposed to be doing, but he was conducting some kind of a raffle. If you put in two 5 dollar bills, and if you were very lucky, it could increase to 200 dollars so I took my wallet and gave him a 10 dollar bill, thinking that that should be as good as two 5 dollar bills, or does he really want two 5's."
