"n"	"dream"
"0001"	"I was in professor Teimes' classroom in Corp. Finance. The room was larger than usual. We had several women in the class, which is not as it is. The professor was asking the class questions on our work. Being unprepared, I feared the time when I would be asked a question. Finally I was asked a question, which evidently I answered all right, since there were none of the repercussions I had feared due to my unpreparedness."
"0002"	"I was a large reception room which was given by some people that I know. I seemed to be busily at work gorging myself with all types of foods. I noticed a huge display of drinks which was actually amazing in that the containers which were orange and red and yellow were piled on top of each other in a pyramid fashion. I believe a friend of mine entered the picture, and then I woke up."
"0003"	"I was talking to my friend MB, 22, at my house. He said something about his uncle getting a new British car for $8000. The next thing I know, I was outside heading for the car when I saw a little puppy who had been and was throwing up. I seemed to shake my head and say, too bad. I guess he's got distemper. I then proceeded to inspect this super streamlined car which was a convertible and was parked across the street."
"0004"	"There were three men in our recreation room whom I recognized but could not remember when I woke up. I went down the stairs and was greeted by a burst of pistol fire. Three slugs ripped the lower right part of my stomach. I was wiping the blood on my shirt as I walked back up the stairs. I then seem to remember being with a dog who was in a similar condition. It seemed very realistic, and I was in great pain until I woke up feeling my right side and was relieved when I found myself in good shape."
"0005"	"I was in a gym with several fellows, including an instructor at reserve who said his name was La Rien. Actually his name is quite different. We were all running around the track above the gym. Suddenly a girl my age who is now married and is also a model is seen swinging on one of the ropes which are suspended from the ceiling. She swings back and forth and occasionally grabs onto the rail next to the track."
"0006"	"I was walking all alone down what must have been a quiet street, as I remember no traffic noise of any sort. As I passed one rather large house, music floated out to me, and I became quite angry because I could not think of the name of the piece. It began to rain then, but instead of hurrying on my way I stood and listened to the music. I was just about ready to give up when a low soft voice said ""don't you remember that, my dear."" I turned, but no one was in sight. Then the voice said, ""that is Beethoven's 4th. How could you ever forget."" I looked frantically around but could see no more. Something made me look at the house for a moment, and for a second I saw a lovely face watching me. She seemed to be crying, yet I wasn't sure. The rain came down harder, the music ceased, and I walked on alone."
"0007"	"This dream was unusual for me as the time and place seem to be absent. I seem to have been walking along a quiet street, and suddenly coming upon a woman screaming at her neighbor because smoke from his fire was getting her wash dirty. The persons were not clear, so I can not identify them. The black smoke and white wash seem to stand out. The thing I remember most is how funny it seemed to me at the time to see the woman yelling at the man and pointing to her ruined wash."
"0008"	"This dream seems to have taken place in a hotel ball room. It was graduation night, and my wife and I were celebrating by having our big night out. The room and people were very real and colorful. The one impression I had upon awakening was that everything seemed so real and alive. The women's formals I remember as bright red's, greens, and blues. The good was just as tasty as it is real, and I remember how satisfied I felt after we ate."
"0009"	"I was hunting, all alone in what seemed to be a thick wooded area. I was carefully following deer tracks in the snow. They were fresh, as ice had not yet formed in the print, and I was very excited. All of a sudden, there it was, at least an eight pointer. I took aim and fired. He fell, but scrambled up at once and hurried off. I gave him a good half hour start and then followed. In an hour or so, I found him bleeding in a little gully. But now as I looked at him trying so desperately to get up and run away, I became sick to my stomach and ashamed of what I had done. Just then some other hunters came up, praised me for my prize, and made quite a fuss over the buck. I gave the kill to them and left."
"0010"	"This dream seemed to be in a forest, although I do not know exactly where. I was sitting on a log apparently waiting for a squirrel to come into sight. The birds were singing, and I felt very sleepy and warm. The squirrel came out on a branch high up in a tree, and I took careful aim but could not fire. I must have said ""run and play little fella"" rather loud because it woke my wife up who in turn woke me. I was conscious of the green moss and little red flowers in the woods as well as the beautiful reddish coat of the squirrel."
"0011"	"I was back in Austria as an American Army captain on a return trip after a lapse of several years (number of years not clear and location in Austria not clear). Everything was recognizable, but no names were clear. I recognized faces of the men and was welcomed and questioned about the U.S. Now, however, many soldiers had their wives there, and there were vases of flowers on tables, and carpets on the floors of the billets, and curtains at the window. My driver had told me where an old friend was staying, and I was on my way to his house when the dream stopped. His name was the only clear one (Lt. John Nagle) and he had been a close buddy through some bitter combat days."
"0012"	"I was in my father's club as a guest, and a middle aged woman who had been seduced by me earlier was there. She was very solicitory of me and told me that she still lived in the same place. I told her I would stop up to see her, and next thing I was knocking on her front door. She was very flustered and flighty when she saw me and asked me to come in, and I wondered if any neighbors had seen me come in. We began to embrace, and I woke up."
"0013"	"I was at working at the gas station, and a good looking fellow drove in in a golden colored Packard. Somehow he let me know that he was the fellow who had robbed several gas stations and stolen a stamp machine from a friend of mine. He then told me that he hadn't intended to rob the station, but when he saw how easy it would be and thought how much money was available that he just threatened the attendant and took the money. He didn't mention the stamp machine. I put gas in his car, and he paid me and left."
"0014"	"I was in the gas station where I work about 34 hours a week, and instead of half of all the employees being there for one shift there was the whole total present which only served to heighten the confusion. Cars were piling in from every direction and stopping in the middle of the drive and blocking traffic as they often do. No one was directing them to proper positions so that they could be serviced, so I was trying vainly to establish some order. The situation grew worse and worse, and each attendant seemed to fell that he was working all by himself with no thought of teamwork. The new boss who was there was just walking around giving out simple useless orders and making the situation worse. As the confusion grew, I became more irritated and the dream faded."
"0015"	"I was on a beach, and a storm was coming up. There were many people with me. All were friends, but none of them were associated to me in reality. A storm was coming up, and everybody was scurrying for safety. It was a threatened storm of hurricane proportions. I ran, calling my little son (2) out of the water, and started up a long fire escape-like stairway leading up a cliff off of the beach carrying the boy. The fragile stairs were sagging and falling apart in pieces, and I kept crawling up and up, carrying my son. Then I was at the top, and the wind died down, and I was in a big house with more people (friends with no names), and I wondered where my father was. I was sure that he had been trapped on the beach and that the stairs were destroyed before he could get away. I ran to look, and when I got to the cliff he was just coming over the edge. I asked him how he did it, and he said it was easy."
"0016"	"I was in the 5th grade in elementary school, that Rita Hayworth was the teacher, but that she was well over 40 years old. She wore a red and white striped dress which was much too small for her. Her appearance was anything but what the common conception of it is now. She was quite ugly. I do not remember the exact subject she was teaching at the time."
"0017"	"I was in a semi-darkened room. There was a girl in the room with me, but quite distant from me. I didn't recognize her at first, but as she approached me, I knew her to be a very beautiful girl I went with three or four years ago. We kissed quite passionately. She was wearing a very pretty but flimsy gown. Next I was in bed with the girl. Neither of us were clothed. I made love to her and awoke immediately afterward."
"0018"	"I was driving along a desolate country road at night. I remember that it was night because I could see the light which my headlights made on the road. I was not going very fast when all of a sudden an old man was in front of the car, and I couldn't stop it. I hit the man and killed him. Immediately a motorcycle policeman drove up beside my car, handed me a piece of paper, told me to sign my name on it. I signed the paper without reading it, and the policeman immediately drove away. I did not know what to do. I returned to the place where I had hit the man, and I was walking this time. As I came to the exact place where I had hit him, the earth under my feet sunk about three feet. I tried to blame the defect in the earth as the cause of the accident."
"0019"	"I had found a television set somewhere in my home. The chief concern of the dream was the television set. It was different from any set I have seen, in that it worked with a switch on the end of a cord, and the screen part was in a separate unit, detachable from the rest of the set. I remember being quite surprised at finding it. I played with the set for a few minutes and then walked away from it, whereupon I awoke."
"0020"	"I was on a train in Hawaii, and as I remember, I was in the army, because there were all men on the train. As the train passed by a pier, I remember showing someone standing near me my ship. I did not dream that I was on the ship at any time. As the train progressed, we passed huge piles of scrapped equipment. Large number of men would jump off the train and attempt to hide in the scrap piles, and armed guards roamed through the scrap piles and found the men almost as soon as they had hidden. I do not know where the train was going nor why I was on the train. I remember that I tried to escape from the train and hide, why, I do not know, unless it was because so many others were. I was successful in finding a place to hide, I remember running into an old barracks building and thinking that it was a good place to hide because somehow I knew that the guards wouldn't search in the building."
"0021"	"My roommate went to Michigan last weekend to visit a mutual friend to whom I spoke the week before. At that time he asked me to get him a date for that week, and he didn't come. I then dreamed that my roommate came back with the friend, and I proceeded to shout at the friend for not coming in the week before, and thus making me feel funny for having tried to get him a date."
"0022"	"I was frantically studying my notes for a test; then a fraternity brother came along and told me to take it easy, that I would never accomplish anything at that fast rate. That woke me up."
"0023"	"I was driving with my girl and her parents, and passed a boy who looked like someone whom I knew about 9 years ago, and never thought too much of him. I was sure that the boy was a brother of the concerned former acquaintance."
"0024"	"I was walking in a strange city with my girl friend, and we noticed that all the people were walking in one direction toward the edge of town. We followed and noticed that they were all heading for a white house, a rather modern, beautiful structure. I went up to it with my girl, and she told me to go in, so I opened the door."
"0025"	"I was walking in downtown New York, and everyone was first rushing by in a daze. In spite of the rushing, the whole scene was very lifeless and confused. Then I met my girl friend, and everyone seemed to be much more cheerful and friendlier."
"0026"	"I was with a girl who may have been my wife. We were wandering around in a triangular plot of land bordered by railroad tracks at two sides. I was looking over the land to determine its possibilities for shooting (possibly hunting). I was very doubtful about my reasons for doing this or why I had chosen this plot to look over. Then I started to discuss my plans with the owner of the land who was a railroad official. I remember the plot of land as being located near the East Cleveland Station where I had sometimes played when I was a boy."
"0027"	"The first thing I remember is that I was on a boat. There didn't seem to be any people on it but me. The boat was moving through a fog, and I was a little anxious about the strange situation in which I found myself. Then I found myself in a strange place, walking down an unfamiliar street. There didn't seem to be anything or anyone that I recognized. Then I saw a man walking down the opposite side of the street who I recognized vaguely as an actor who had played the part of a gangster on TV production a few nights before. This man, when he saw me, took out a gun and began shooting at me. I dodged the bullets and started to run through alleys to elude him. Then I woke up in a sweat."
"0028"	"The dream began as I opened up a hotel room door. Inside the room sat a beautiful young blonde who was not recognizable to me. As I entered, she rose and walked over to me, and just as I was about to kiss her the scene changed. Then I found myself running towards a large crowd gathered in an unfamiliar crowded street. I pushed through to the center of the crowd and found my lost dream girl lying there injured by a hit skip driver. I then sat down beside her took her in my arms to comfort her and woke up."
"0029"	"The dreamer was in a strange room. There were many doors leading out, but he didn't know which one to choose. He had a feeling that he had to choose one of them but that there was danger in choosing the wrong door. He opened one and stepped into a dark void through which he started to fall. Then he woke up."
"0030"	"I was kept a prisoner in a room which opened into a larger room which was barn-like. I was confined with another man, and I don't remember whether I was he or whether he was somebody else. It seemed that perhaps I was the only prisoner, and that my dream mind was watching the affair sometimes from a distance and sometimes closely. My jailer was a fiendish sort of person who was going to kill me. I wasn't clear why he didn't kill me, since I was in his power. The jailer kept taunting me by running from window to window, peering in and leering at me."
"0031"	"I was walking along the street when I spotted something green attached to a hubcap of a car parked along the street. I went up to the car and looked and saw that it was money, (a roll of bills). I took the money and put it in my pocket. Looking around the curb, I saw other bills lying around. I quickly picked up the money, picking up about ten here and there. Then I started to run. I then woke up."
"0032"	"I was crossing a valley (a small piece of land between two hills), and I heard a friend of mine, a young boy in my neighborhood of about the same age as myself, shouting to me from the top of one of the hills. I looked at him, and he kept on shouting my name and something else to me. I started to run very fast until I came home. I then awoke."
"0033"	"I was in a large open space, and huge animals of all sort with huge roars and wide open mouths (big gnashing teeth) were chasing me. I ran from side to side trying to escape. I was out of breath. The huge animal monsters finally hemmed me in (surrounded me). They were going to eat me and claw me. I then awoke."
"0034"	"A letter came to our house. My father took it out of the mail box. The letter was for me. My father called me for I was across the street at my boyfriend's house. I ran across the street and opened the letter. It was from Western Reserve Medical School. It was an acceptance. I kissed my father and jumped with joy. I was so very, very happy that I started to dance around. I then awoke."
"0035"	"I dream that I was shaving, that I had a huge black beard. I was shaving, and I cut myself on the face. Blood started to run out very quickly. I stopped shaving and tried to blot the cut with powder and ointment, but the blood still came out fast. My hands and whole face were full of blood. I dunked my face in the wash bowl full of cold water. I then awoke."
"0036"	"I was standing in a railroad station. The location of the station was unknown to me, and all I noticed about it was that it was very bare and desolate. There was a great crowd of people in it, but I could not distinguish any of their features. As I stood there, I saw a man in an Army uniform of the first world war. I was puzzled because I could not distinguish his rank. On one sleeve he a had a red major's star, and on the other sleeve he had a gold and black private's stripe. I was looking for someone but could not find anyone due to the large group of soldiers that were boarding the train under the direction of this one soldier described before. As I watched, a soldier came running up to the station and just managed to board the train as it pulled out of the station. The thought struck me that the soldier was a girl that used to live next door to us, but had moved many years ago. I began to chase the train yelling that the last soldier was a girl and did not belong on the train."
"0037"	"I was walking down a street in an unknown city. It might have been San Francisco, but it was not that clear. I was dressed in some sort of a uniform. It was made up of blue pants and a red cap. The brightness of the red color bothered me. I was looking for my girlfriend, although I knew that I would not find her. As I walked along a woman Marine came along and took my arm. She seemed to be a stuffed dummy, because her arm felt like cloth stuffed with sawdust. I turned to ask her if she knew where I could find my girlfriend and found that she had disappeared. I then stopped at my car, but found in its place an old green Model T Ford which was crowded with a group of my fraternity brothers. They were going to a football game at a stadium which was very close to where the car was parked. I could not recognize any of them and took it for granted that they were my friends. They gave me two tickets to the game, and then they also disappeared. I was left alone holding the two tickets and wondering where I could find a girl to take to the game."
"0038"	"I was on board a train that was moving very slowly through Cleveland. I could see the buildings and streets, although it was night outside and there seemed to be no streetlights on anywhere. I kept trying to open a window because my girlfriend was walking along beside the train, and I wanted to help her get on. The train never seemed to leave the station, which was on the order of a small town's loading platform. Yet I saw the scenery moving by. I kept struggling with the window and couldn't budge it."
"0039"	"I was climbing around a building that was being constructed. There were no stairways, so I climbed up the steel girders. After I got up there to the top, I looked down and couldn't see the ground because of the maze of girders below me. I stood there with my feet on separate beams and wondered how I was going to get down. After a while, a foreman came up and said that if I didn't have anything to do I could go to work. He took me into a small room and gave me a sheaf of papers and told me to start checking off items."
"0040"	"I was backing a new Ford out of a driveway. The car was loaded with people, none of whom I could recognize. There was a lot of snow on the ground, and I couldn't steer the car. I thought that the blue color of the car looked nice against the white snow. After I got it into the street, there were streetcar tracks which the car traveled on, so that I didn't have to steer it. A group of little children were throwing snowballs that kept breaking on the windshield."
"0041"	"I was working for a firm. Accidentally I found the firm's records that they were carrying on illegal activities plus their surface business. Somehow an official of the firm learned of my knowledge and held me in captivity. After a while in captivity I was able to get word to an outside person. However, this didn't have any results. But after a while I escaped. As soon as I got away, I went to the police and told them my story. Then the police and I went to this building and alerted all the innocent people who were working for other firms. The police then staged a raid, but still the criminals wouldn't give up. Then the police used tear gas, and the criminals finally gave up. Then there seemed to be some time elapsed, and the next thing I can remember is a photographer taking my picture in front of the building, and the picture was to be printed in the next issue of the newspaper. Then I woke up."
"0042"	"I was working. In this particular case I dreamed that I was assisting Drs. Beck and Kinley with a carotid-jugular anastomosis. During the operation the surgeon, Dr. Beck became very irritated because the stomach became hemolized, and the anastomosis was clotted. Then Dr. Beck's assistants also became irritated, and everything seemed to go wrong. But finally after the injection of a certain drug, the clot was dissolved and everything was fine again. After the operation Dr. Beck thanked everyone in the operating room for having patience with him during this trying operation on this specific patient. Dr. Beck is a man of about 55 years of age and professor of neurosurgery at University Hospitals, and his assistants were men in their late 20's who are serving their residencies at University Hospitals,"
"0043"	"My parents and I went to morning services at Church. Because of crowded conditions we weren't able to sit together. This fact made up the text of the dream because my father got into an argument with a woman because she wouldn't move down in the seat in order to let him sit down. Their voices became very loud, and soon everyone in the congregation was watching them. However, there seemed to be a short time of quietness, and then the services were over. When everyone was leaving the church they were all watching my father and this woman. And my mother and I were ashamed, so we didn't walk with or talk to my father."
"0044"	"I was in a movie house getting ready to leave the place. Just as I was about to leave, I heard a shot come from the men's lavatory. Immediately after the shot, I saw a well-built man of about 25 years leave the room hurriedly. Well, most of the crowd went after the men, and I and two other unidentifiable men went into the men's room to see what damage the shot did. When we got in there, we found a small baby (about 1 year) lying on the floor and bleeding profusely. We tried to do what we could to stop the bleeding; however, the baby died. We left the room to call the police, and just as we came out of the room we saw a crowd of men bringing back the man who fired the shot. Right after this I woke up."
"0045"	"I happened to look out a window at the back of our house. I was able to see the back of the house on the next street. Just as I got to my window a light went on in the window of the other house, and I saw that it was their bathroom. Two women, about 23, were undressing there and getting ready to shower. I stayed at my window until they were naked to the waist, and then someone from our house called me to the front. I was very perplexed because I had to move. I wanted to stay to see the rest of the procedure of the girls undressing. All I could see were their soft looking breasts with rosy nipples. Then I, very disgruntled, went to the person who called me and didn't see any more of the disrobing."
"0046"	"I dreamt that I entered a room and met my good friend (m, 20) at a table. I think there were other fellows sitting at the table. Maybe they were playing cards. As I sat down my eyelash fell to my lap which caused me great excitement. I think I screamed. I was met by a great deal of laughter from my friend which infuriated me. I immediately jumped up and ran to the mirror where I saw that my eyelash had not fallen out, but it was only an imitation eyelash that had dropped to my lap."
"0047"	"This dream is very vague in my mind. As I remember it, the dream had some connection with being in a room (I think there were others in the room) and a very good friend of mine (f, 20) who was recently married entered the room. As I looked at her I immediately noticed that she was pregnant. I was very happy to see her, but I could hardly recognize her. As I approached her and looked at her, it was not really the original girl who I thought I recognized, but another friend of mine (f, 20) who was just recently married. I remember we greeted, and then entered an empty room where we sat on the floor and talked. I do not remember the contents of the conversation. I think we discussed the young lady friend of mine whom I recently broke up with."
"0048"	"I am really not sure this is definitely a dream, but as I was sleeping I envisioned a piece of paper which had wavy lines in it. I think a small drawing would explain it better than words. The paper was colorless, but the lines were blue. There was no writing on the paper."
"0049"	"I was just entering a dormitory on campus to call on a young lady. As I entered, I met, to my surprise, a very good friend of mine from my hometown. He was rather angry at me and would not speak to me. Just then a young girl whom I have not seen in at least 3 or 4 years came walking down the steps. She, also, was angry at me because she said we had seen each other on campus a few times, and I had not said anything to her. I jokingly took her in my arms and was kidding her about my not having ever seen her. At that moment the alarm rang. The fellow is a very good friend of mine, while the girl in the dream was and is a rather strange acquaintance. I went to school with her, never had any associations or interests toward her. Both people are the same age as I am."
"0050"	"I could hardly forget this dream as it involved the young lady I was extremely interested in at the time. The dream was merely this. I apparently was standing on the street, and she approached me. Very passively she walked up to me, and without any greeting she said that she would like me to see her engagement ring -- extending her arm as she spoke. As I looked at the ring, I couldn't even feel involved by sentiment. In the dream I was at that time concerned by the fact that I was not overcome by emotion nor was I angry."
"0051"	"I was walking down a wide highway. On the right, the buildings which I saw were huge and far apart. One building which I noticed was a large glass enclosed thing with new cars in it. In front a girl, with her back to me, was standing there. She was dressed in a white negligee. This excited me, but when I came closer I noticed that she had cotton and adhesive tape all over her body like they covered sores, so I kept walking."
"0052"	"I was sitting in a professor's office, and he was examining my penis. All through the dream I had the fear that he would find out that I masturbated. He looked all over it, and I was beginning to sigh with relief, and just then he opened my urethra, to me it seemed magnified several times. In it we saw a big drop of what I knew to be coffee cream but which I thought that he would think was semen."
"0053"	"I was in a hall with lockers on the side, low ceiling, a bluish, dark, cast to the surroundings. A dark-haired stranger whom I was with had just shot somebody. I didn't hear the shot, but I was conscious that a crime had been committed. The fellow who committed the crime had thrown the gun on the floor and somehow pushed it over my fingertips so that my fingerprints were on it. Then he ran away and left me alone yelling out my innocence."
"0054"	"I was sitting on the grass in a field sorting golf balls with 3 or 4 other boys. We looked up in the air, and there was a two-winged plane doing loop-the-loops. The next thing I knew, the plane was a one-winger, a Piper Cub, and it was flying right at us. We ducked, and the plane hit the ground but didn't explode. A tall man with a flat nose climbed out and came at us. We were laughing, and he was enraged because his landing gear was damaged."
"0055"	"I was driving a car following a fraternity brother of mine who was driving a yellow Pontiac convertible (actually his). We were on a dirt road. We came to a stop street. He went through. I was going to go through it too but suddenly got frightened and stopped. Just then a police car went by (an old Ford with Police written in gold on it). I thought to myself that Paul C. (friend's name) would get arrested. I followed. We were on a very wide highway. It was night, and way up ahead it was very shadowy. I saw the police car go on the right of my friend, and I had a premonition of a wreck, and just then I heard a crash. I then saw my friend's car back out of the middle."
"0056"	"It seems that we were having a party at my house. Among other guests, there were two nuns and two fathers. They, with the other guests, were drinking beer from copper of pewter mugs. I noticed that beer kept spilling on the bare floor in the corner near a table. For some reason this was rather disturbing, so I went for a walk. The next thing I remember I was walking through a long tunnel. It was like the tunnels that connect the various lines in the large ""metro"" (subway) stations in Paris. I came out on Euclid Ave. in front of Moe's. I walked around on Euclid and then reentered the tunnel. I returned home to find the party over and the house quiet."
"0057"	"A friend and I were standing on a table next to a wall in the garage of our fraternity house. We were taking pieces of carved marble, which might have been parts of a builder's facade, from statues and throwing them to the floor. (I don't remember whether or not they broke.) A cop came along and shined a flashlight in our eyes. We jumped off the table and out of the garage. (The cop was the short, fat one who guards the Severance Hall parking lot.) He had a large, mostly white dog; maybe a collie. The dog chased us. We climbed over a back fence (with difficulty) and escaped."
"0058"	"I was standing in a clearing with some woods and a large windowed room in the background. I was standing with some friends who said that there were several of the enemy in the woods and in the room. (I think the enemy was Nazis or some nationalistically bound group.) We all had cutlasses in our hands. Some enemy approached, and I was told I must kill them or be killed. I started hacking at one with my cutlass. The enemy was a block of wood 10"" x 2"" x 5'. My blows were very violent, but rather inaccurate. None penetrated more than an inch or two. I finally killed the enemy but was afraid that his companions would kill me. Suddenly a young man dressed in a Tyrolian alpine costume appeared from the room and led me away to safety."
"0059"	"I was standing in the dining room with my dog, lob king out the window at a sunny Saturday afternoon when a brown Buick (1939-limited) with white sidewalls drove up. My father's brother got out of the car and came to the door. Dad let him in. They went into the library and talked rather loudly. I opened the dining room window, and the dog, Becky, and I jumped out. We ran across the front yard to the car and just looked."
"0060"	"I was sitting in a 2nd class railway carriage in either Prance of Switzerland. A friend, whom I can't identify was sitting next to me. The window was open, and we were talking to a man who was standing on the station platform, the father of my friend. He was discussing money matters and allowance with his son, and trying to comfort me. It seems that he brought me tidings of an untimely death of a friend of mine Ellyn Margolis."
"0061"	"I was given gas to reduce a dislocated shoulder I received playing baseball. I was trying my best to keep my mind alert throughout the anesthetic. As I was going under the effect of the gas, I remember trying to yell out that I should be recognized. There was no one present that I can remember, and I had the feeling that I was suspended in space. There was no sound, and it appeared to me that I had been able to force myself out of the gravity of society, and I was at last on the outside looking in. Everything was at a complete calm until suddenly I was jarred by a loud noise, a high pitched voice that struck me and then disappeared and finally reappeared again, going through the same cycle many times. Then I awoke with a start. While I was unconscious, I seem to remember doughnut shaped forms that kept getting brighter and darker, first the doughnut itself and then the hole seemed to change its brilliance. The light seemed to be self-contained and not reflected."
"0062"	"I was watching a parade of figures. I surmised that they were all women. They were all modeling underclothes to me, and I was approving or disapproving of them. There was one figure, in particular that impressed me. I couldn't see this figure's face, but there was a sheet of about 18 inches wrapped around this figure's body. This figure met with my approval and with that she was hurled over a cliff."
"0063"	"I was sitting in a large banquet hall which was unfamiliar to me. There was a group of my friends around me. They were all males. Connie Mack was sitting on the lap of one of my fraternity brothers. At the same table I was sitting were three of my friends, all of which I haven't seen for about a year. One fellow in particular was a friend that moved to the west coast nearly two years ago and whom I have failed to correspond with for these two years. There was food on the tables, and I could make out the fruit salad and the natural colors of the fruit. Nothing in particular was being done by anybody present. It was as if I had an instantaneous picture of what was going on."
"0064"	"I received a phone call from an old girl friend of mine. She asked why I hadn't called her. She is going to school in Chicago. She acted as though she was very interested in me, but I had the feeling that it was just an act. She asked me a question that I couldn't answer. This question seemed ridiculous to me at the time, and because of that I forgot what it was she said."
"0065"	"My dog met a little friend for himself, and through his actions he seemed confused in what to do. He examined this little dog, and when his curiosity had been satisfied and he discovered she was a female, he attempted intercourse. The female seemed to welcome this to such a large degree that the female's vagina opened up to such a large size that she appeared to no longer be a small dog. My dog, realizing this, was frightened and slinked away with his tail between his legs."
"0066"	"I was signing a duet at the Masonic auditorium on Euclid with a girl I used to go with when I was about 18. We started to sing a duet called ""the passage birds farewell,"" and the audience began to laugh at us. When we looked behind us we saw a number of different animals. The one I can remember most vividly was a turkey. The girl stopped singing and went over and chased the animals off the stage. I remember I didn't sing the duet very well and was worried about what the girl would say to me after we were finished. We finished the duet, and the audience was as quiet as a tomb; there was absolutely no applause, and we walked off the stage down through the audience amid silence. The dream ended."
"0067"	"The only other person in the dream was a woman I work with (49). She told me to go to the stock room and bring some red dolls (the kind you might win at an amusement park with feathers for skirts), but I wanted to bring blue dolls. We had an argument, and I went to the manager and told him that if he didn't fire her I would quit. The last thing I remember of the dream I was preparing to quit."
"0068"	"I dreamt I was in a church about to get married to a girl I work with. In the middle of the service I left the altar and went to the organ to sing a wedding song. After I sang, I came back to the altar and the service went on. I don't remember whether the service was finished, but the one thing that sticks in my mind is that I didn't get married."
"0069"	"I was going over to my boyfriend's house to borrow a book. When I got there he was in the kitchen with another friend of ours. The odd part was that they were both in their underwear. The only color in the dream was in the shorts of one of them which were mustard color. I remember they both wanted to go upstairs, but for some reason only one could go at a time, and they were debating who should go first. One of them finally left, and I woke up. All three guys who participated in the dream were of the same age (24)."
"0070"	"I was at John Adam's football field watching a game. The seats in front of me were vacant, but sitting on my right side was a man and his girlfriend. The thing I remember most about the man was that he was extremely handsome. During the game two friends of mine came in (male) and sat in front of us. The man next to me asked if these two people (both 24) were from John Adams, and I told him they were. He said that it was too bad because John Adams couldn't win the championship because for some reason he didn't give, John Adams was to be disqualified from competition. Here the dream ended."
"0071"	"I was at a co-op house meeting. There was some sort of a complaint. The guilty person wasn't known. A girl at the meeting seemed to feel guilty or else felt that the implication was directed at her. She related her story. In this story, she told how someone called her. But she didn't say who. How it happened in the dream was that the person who called her was me. Someone asked her who called her. (This someone is unknown in the dream.) She told him. This someone confronted me and accused, implied, or told me. I immediately came to my defense saying that I did call, but for such and such reasons, and that I did stop back at the house, but for a few minutes. This defense in the dream seemed to be a satisfactory defense or story as it seemed to clear me."
"0072"	"I was in my former home, and my father was telling me things about my mother. My mother was also in the house and heard what my father was saying. My father seemed to be trying to turn me against my mother. For a while, I was believing him, and I felt that my mother had done something wrong. Then for some reason, I changed my mind, and I began to dislike my father. I am sure that there was some good reason in the dream for my changing my mind, but I can't remember it. After this, I began to think of my mother's weak heart and how she might die. This was accompanied by a very sad, sympathetic, loving attitude toward my mother. Then I went into my mother's bedroom and noticed the sheets and the pillow were dirty; that is, they were uniformly dark. A sheet would have to be very dirty to be this color. Then I thought what a pity that my poor mother has to sleep in a bed like that, and I had the same feeling described above."
"0073"	"I was walking down Euclid Ave. There was a dog closely resembling the dog I mentioned in a previous dream (Brownie). Yet I realized in the dream that Brownie was dead, and that this wasn't the same dog. This dog was lying on his stomach, and when I first approached him, he may have snarled or at least he looked mean or unfriendly. As I began to pet him, he turned over on his side and his back as dogs often will do. Even while I was petting him, I felt that I couldn't trust him completely, and that he might bite me. The dog seemed to enjoy my petting and scratching him. Though I felt he might bite me, the fear of being bitten was very small, but there was a fear. I had a candy bar in my pocket, and as I rose to leave I felt that the dog wanted this candy bar (a Baby Ruth). However, I didn't want to give the dog this candy bar, and then I told him that he couldn't have it. I then left and proceeded west down Euclid Ave. on my way I believe to a typing class which I am now taking at John Hay three nights a week."
"0074"	"This fellow in the co-op, B.M., was sitting at the kitchen table drinking either milk or coffee. He didn't appear to have anything to go with his drink, so he asked me if he could have some of my graham crackers. I consented. I went out of the kitchen, and when I later returned, I found him eating the graham crackers plus some cookies that he had of his own. I thought to myself, ""here he has cookies and cake of his own, and yet he had the nerve to ask me for my graham crackers."""
"0075"	"I borrowed a book from someone at the co-op whose name I believe was Bernie. Actually I'm not sure of who this Bernie was, but he seemed to be a good friend of mine, and I had a mild superior feeling toward him; that is, I had the feeling that I would always act natural when talking to him, whereas with many of the members of the co-op, I still act somewhat superficial. I was returning the book to this Bernie, and he lived at a two-family house. I rang the upstairs bell, and some male co- op members answered the door. I asked for Bernie, and they told me he lived downstairs. I went downstairs and rang the bell, and when the door opened I found that more co-op fellows were living together downstairs. I was somewhat surprised that they were all living in the same house. I returned the book. I also had the feeling that this Bernie was a small guy of slight build."
"0076"	"I was having a test in historical geology. Instead of being a regular written test, the questions asked were on this order: ""Draw an endoceras proteiforme of the Ordovician period."" This was not a class test, but each pupil was called to the board individually to answer one question. After this question, I said, ""holy Jesus I could not do that in a month of Sundays."" I didn't recognize any one in this dream."
"0077"	"I saw an immense plain on which there was no vegetation. The time was about late evening for it was quite gloomy. On the middle of the plain was (a) a stone about the size of a pea, and next to it (b) a boulder of immense size. The two objects just stood poised like that for a while, and then all of a sudden, the boulder started to roll slowly toward the smaller stone."
"0078"	"Charlene and I were married at St. Coleman's Catholic church. I watched as Florence and Louise, two of the bride's girlfriends came down the aisle. They were bridesmaids and were dressed in pink. Then I saw Dolores, who actually had gotten married that day, come down the aisle in a dress of blue. I saw the ushers -- Sam, Bill, and Frank -- leave me at the side entrance of the church to go to meet their bridesmaids in front of the altar. Now I saw Charlene come down the aisle, with her Dad helping her. I started going to meet her, thinking why did I do it? We went directly to the altar without genuflecting, were married, received communion, and started leaving the church. I thought I heard a fire engine and started running out of the church, but I finally realized it was my alarm clock and woke up."
"0079"	"I was at the home of one of my neighbors, Joan, a girl of about 22 years. She's one of the loose girls with whom I've had sexual relations with several times. She came over, set on my lap end started to kiss and caress me. I returned her kisses and caressed her entire body. Suddenly she took me into the dining room, lay herself down on the table, after removing a few of her clothes, and pulled me on her. I had attained an erection, and now she touched it"
"0080"	"I was in the dentist's chair. He had just administered gas and was telling me to count. I knew I was dreaming, so I didn't bother. I heard a metallic clink of him picking up his tools. He started pushing on one of my teeth. I was trying to squirm away from his grasp, but he persisted. Then I felt him pulling on my teeth, and I felt great pain at this time. Then it was out, and I was expectorating in a bowl at my side."
"0081"	"A violent fight took place between two large groups of men, apparently strikers and police. Brutal beatings are suffered by the strikers as the police rode their horses roughshod over them. The setting of this dream seemed highly unnatural -- almost like the back drop of a play at a theater."
"0082"	"The location of the dream was a picnic ground far from anything else. The only people at the picnic that I knew were my father and myself. When it came time to leave the picnic, we found that our car had been stolen. As we were waiting to hitch a ride back into town, a good friend of the family (middle-aged woman) came along in her car. She stopped and asked us the cause of our trouble, but for some reason that I can't remember, she refused us a ride and drove off by herself."
"0083"	"I was engaged in a vicious game of hockey with a number of fellows my own age. The bumping and board-checking were something terrific. Our team had been getting the worst of it all night, and finally, in desperation, we went on an all-out rampage. Our star player was seriously injured and carried off the ice, and then the game seemed to end."
"0084"	"I was working in an apple orchard with a number of other people somewhat older than myself. Suddenly the woman on the ladder next to me slipped and fell to the ground. Although she screamed and pleaded for help, no one paid any attention to her and simply left her lying there."
"0085"	"During the day on my way home on the streetcar an accident occurred. The streetcar had run over an old man and pinned him beneath the wheels. The wrecking crew came to move the streetcar, but for some reason their jack would not work. I cannot remember what ever happened to alleviate the poor man condition."
"0086"	"I was at a television party at the home of a friend. I did not recognize those who attended, outside of a girl who was supposed to be the sister of the girl with whom I was involved (I never did see my girlfriend in the dream at all.) This sister, however, I recognized as being a young widow with whom a friend of mine actually had an affair; I had seen a picture of her a few months before. At any rate, she seemed physically desirable to me in the dream, so I purposely waited until most of the others had gone home or had fallen asleep -- was dimly aware of the fact that the party had worn out its welcome, and the host wanted us to leave (it must have been 3:00 or 4:00). We finally got up to leave; as I was the only one who had a car, I was obliged to take the others home. I intentionally did not take this girl home before I dropped off the others. Then we parked. I placed my arm about her, and noticing the disgusting leer of sheer physical desire on her face, I recalled thinking that I was certainly a dirty rascal intending to make love to this girl merely because her sister (allegedly my true love) was not there."
"0087"	"I was riding down Hough Ave. near east 75th St. with Phil Harris, the famous star of movie and radio fame. As we stopped at the corner signal, Alice Faye, Harris' blond wife passed in front of us. Both of them smiled at each other in recognition and launched a snappy, humorous dialogue that is so characteristic of their weekly radio programs. I recalled a distinct sense of awe as I marveled at their keen wit and sense of humor."
"0088"	"I was an attendant at the mental hospital. I was instructed by a nurse to take a patient down on the elevator to lower floor. Patient, often violent, was lying on a roll-away table (similar to type used in operating rooms). I felt a vague sensation of fear and lack of confidence in my ability to handle the task in event of an emergency, but I agreed to carry out the instructions. We entered the elevator, with me in the elevator was another attendant (not considered dependable by me) and a trustee patient. We began to descend, and I began to wonder what would happen if the bottom fell out of the elevator; suddenly the floor of the elevator opened (similar to the bomb bays in an airplane), and we all fell through. All of us, except the patient, managed to hang onto ledges in the elevator shaft; the other attendant and I were hanging on to the patient at the same time. Both the patient and the trustee were hysterical, shouting, crying, and struggling violently; I remember a definite feeling of disgust, and I thought to myself, isn't this typical of human beings. You can never depend on them for anything -- not even to the extent of making their personal rescue easier."
"0089"	"Herb, a friend of mine, had borrowed my car in order to transport some movie equipment. As he drove the car off, he misjudged the height of a low steel bridge; the car struck the lower part of the bridge, damaging the top of my car quite severely. Angered, I pushed my way into the car and demanded that Herb let me drive. We got underway, but the car behaved in a crazy fashion. It weaved all over the road. The brakes would not work, and there was no pick-up. Driving into the parking lot at home, I noticed several cars parked in front of my garage, so I was unable to park my car (which further irritated me). My sister then approached, glanced at the damage to my car, and began to insist loudly that our parents would not help to pay for the repairs. Angrily, I told her that I didn't expect anybody to help me with the repairs -- that I would pay for them myself."
"0090"	"I was taking my girlfriend home on a bicycle; as I didn't know where she lived, I asked her for directions. She said drive straight down Payne Ave. until you come to a dead end, then turn right, go on for a short distance, and then turn left. We speeded down the bumpy road (made even bumpier by the fact that one side of the road was being torn up for repair purposes). We arrived at the dead end near a group of long, shabby looking shacks near the edge of a lake. As it was late at night, I was alarmed when I noticed that the lights were on in her house. I wondered whether or not her parents were waiting up for her. As we approached the front door, I noticed her sister sitting there on the stairs; as my girl friend opened the door, I could see a large group of people inside talking in a low murmur. My girlfriend greeted them cordially and entered, leaving me standing outside. As I had little else to do, I engaged myself in conversation with her sister. An old man came and stood near us silently for a while; then he asked in a friendly manner, who I was. Immediately I introduced myself to him and found then that he was my girlfriend's father."
"0091"	"I was at a birthday party, and present were, as I remember, my girlfriend (20), my brother (29) and my sister-in-law (27). They sang ""Happy Birthday"" to me. There was a huge, decorated birthday cake in the center of the table. Ever time I counted the candles on the cake they increased in number. Amazed at this, I was told that when one reaches 21, the rest of his life passes quickly, and I shouldn't be surprised at this at all. Even in the dream this did not make sense to me but worried me intensely."
"0092"	"I was seated in front of a group of elderly bearded men who sat solemnly like a tribunal. Each of these people had a large cloth bag seemed with a drawstring, on the floor next to him. One at a time they would bring forth and/or take something from their sack and make a speech about it. As I remember, the articles included a book, a hat, a pair of socks, and a pipe. The talks were discussions of the characteristics of each article. The speaker would say a few words, and then his companions would tell him to sit down, and another person would start. This procedure was repeated several times. One of the men kept laughing at everything that was said, and finally his companions told him he must stop or else leave. Then a large French door was down in front of the whole scene, and the dream ended there, as looking at a blank wall."
"0093"	"I was in front of a large colonial mansion type home. It was raining very hard. I was intensely thirsty, and I stood there with a small kettle trying to catch enough water for a drink. Just as I was lifting the receptacle to my lips to drain it, someone ran up to me, struck my arm, and knocked the receptacle to the ground. This person (not clearly defined) said that the water was contaminated and impure. I laughed and remarked that rain water is pure, but the person called my attention to the fact that all the water which I had collected came down a drain from the roof and had run over the dirty downspouts."
"0094"	"I was typing an English theme. As I transferred the rough draft to the final, I threw away the pages of the rough draft one by one into the waste basket as I finished. I became very tired and leaned back to light a cigarette, and somehow the waste basket caught on fire. I took it to the kitchen in order to extinguish the flames with water, and from the charred remains I realized that it was my final, typed draft of the paper which I had destroyed. It was too late to do the work over, and I realized that this would mean a poor grade in the course."
"0095"	"In the dream, I was employed as a clerk in a large department store. As lunch time approached, I was anxious to get to the cafeteria, as I was very hungry. However, I was waiting on an elderly woman customer who couldn't make up her mind what kind of drapes she wanted to buy. She kept taking up my time all afternoon, so that I was unable to go to lunch at all. Finally I became so irate that I became very antagonistic toward the woman. She informed the supervisor, and he told me to be more courteous and wait on the lady. Finally she decided on the purchase, paid me, and left. The currency she paid me looked rather suspicious to me at the time, but I angrily went on about business. When the cash register was checked at the end of the day, the bills were found to be counterfeit. For some illogical reason the supervisor said that he was going to call the police to have me arrested."
"0096"	"I was on a Mayfield streetcar, going to school. It was morning, but very dark and stormy. Actually it was dark as night. I suddenly realized I had forgotten a very important book and would have to turn around and go back; I got off the streetcar at the corner of Euclid Heights and Mayfield and waited for a bus. It was raining very hard, and I was afraid that it would not come. Luckily a bus came quickly, but it went down Euclid Heights Blvd. instead of turning on Mayfield. Another bus came behind it, however, and I got on. Then I had gotten off the bus and was back again and had the book under my arm. The bus came, and I got on. I felt relieved because I would be on time."
"0097"	"I was reading a book of Shakespeare's plays, but rather than seeing the words, I was visualizing the plays on the stage. The play I was seeing seemed at first to be King Lear, but soon I realized that it was another tragedy which I had heard of, but I didn't know what the name was. When I had finished reading, I knew the name. I awoke, but could not think of the name."
"0098"	"I was in my driveway, but the house where I was living was strange to me. A 1936 Chevrolet car which I had owned was standing in the driveway. Someone told me that the person who had bought the car from me couldn't keep it. He had to give it up, so he was giving it to me. The fenders of the car, which had been dented, were now fixed and painted. I was very glad to have the car back again, especially since I had been told that nothing was wrong with it now."
"0099"	"I was in a canoe with several people. We were shooting arrows at a women's clothing store which was on a kind of an island. We had a store on the mainland, and they were our competition and had forced us to close. When we had each shot three arrows, we were all out of arrows and had to stop shooting. I got out of our canoe and went into the store. It had heavy glass doors. I told the woman who owned it that we had lost the fight, and I wanted to pick up our arrows. I began to pick them up, and as I did so I picked up some of her arrows. Most of the arrows were hers, but they were not marked. The arrows were all different colors, and all the green ones belonged to her. Mine were red and purple, but I could not find many of mine. Instead, I took some of the arrows that could not be identified."
"0100"	"I was in my house, in the basement. I was closing up the house. No one else was there. I felt as if I were escaping from something. There was a kind of mechanical contrivance which resembled a bicycle, which I crawled around and through. I became partially entangled in it, then escaped. Then I got on a very tiny railroad handcar no larger than a toy and began to pump furiously. Somehow it was large enough to hold me, but I got nowhere. The track took me right back to where I had started. Then I had a feeling of having made my escape and was sneaking off through the dark. I went out through a window in the garage. I closed it behind me and wanted to lock it to keep out robbers, but I couldn't. I was anxious to get away, and I left the vicinity."
"0101"	"I was seated in my third floor study when suddenly I had the feeling that someone was watching me. I walked to the doorway to find my brother in law standing there with one of the German revolvers he brought home from Germany in his hand. Standing beside him was the most horrible looking woman I ever saw. My brother in law is 25."
"0102"	"I was playing 3rd base in a baseball game on a strange field and with teammates who were unknown to me. I was moving in close on a batter when he smashed a hard hit ball to my right. I felt that it was vitally important for me to get the ball and yet I could not move. It seemed that I was rooted to the spot."
"0103"	"A United States Army medical unit was in action on some sort of a level sandy battlefield. I was a member of the outfit and was tending to wounded men. I remember vividly the red and white crosses on the arms and helmets of the other medics and the redness of the blood of the wounded. It seemed that the outfit to which we were attached was being beaten and enemy (vague, formless shapes) was advancing. I remember seeing the figure of the commanding officer (a man whom I then recognized but cannot now remember) gave the news that we were beaten and could not retreat. I remember the feeling of terror and fear and the desire to run away battling within me with the desire to fulfill my duty."
"0104"	"I was seated in the living room of a girl (19) who has slept with me in the past. A friend of mine (m, 20) was there as were the girl's parents. I next found myself seated at the dinner table with the girl and another man (22) who was blackballed two semesters ago from my fraternity. I found myself cutting and heating his hand, instead of the food which was on my plate. I was impressed that he felt no pain. After dinner, we returned to the living room and then left her parents there and went to her bedroom. As we were going to bed, I noticed my friend coming into the room. I took a shot at him with a gun I found by the bedside. Suddenly this other man (the one who had been blackballed) leaped into the room and attacked me with a knife. I was terrified."
"0105"	"I was in the dining car of some sort of a train. I seemed to be on the way with a group of my father's friends to a football game. (I had that feeling and the men in the car were warmly and roughly dressed.) I was standing at the entrance to the car watching a group of the above-mentioned men eating at one of the tables. A drunk staggered down the aisle and began an argument with one of the men. A fight was narrowly averted and the next thing I knew was that a huge blond man was standing at the opposite door of the car and hurling baseballs with tremendous force at us. (We were covering on the floor.) I was not hit but was terrified."
"0110"	"I was going to play tennis. Somehow I heard that some Mexican bandits were in the vicinity and had captured a man. I went to my uncle (49) to borrow his guns. He told me they were in the car. I went to the car and got them. I walked out and saw my uncle in his car with his wife; he was petting her. Another uncle (39) (he lives in Calif.) was parked in front and he pulled away, rode down the road and turned the corner. My aunt (28) remarked that he was going too fast. My uncle said he wasn't."
"0111"	"A friend and I are playing in the street near one of those deep street excavations that Cleveland Illuminating Co. makes to install cable. It is covered by a complex of tangle and wooden structure and is of infinite depth. I am not too anxious to climb on this wooden frame but feel as though I must or lose the admiration of my friend. (I have no idea who he is.) As I climb around I realize that one false move and I'm cooked. Sure enough, I slip and almost fall into the dark depths but something, somewhere, somehow, saves me. I remember feeling a sensation in my genitals as I am about to fall (falling actually does produce a sensation as does most motion through space). It is accompanied by a vacuum feeling in the throat."
"0112"	"Somebody (someone unknown to me, but of obvious authority) accused me of a crime which I did not commit. I think the crime is murder. I'm not sure. At this time I was due to receive some sort of award in honor of some achievement. Because of the accusation, I do not receive the coveted award and I am heart sick. In my dream I am very aware of the feeling of outrage because of the injustice done to me. I finally awake with this feeling still persisting. I then feel very relieved that it was only a dream."
"0113"	"I was playing football in a dusty lot on a hot summer day. I had on a terrifically heavy uniform and the temperature was in the 90's. Wet with sweat, parched from thirst, tired from scrimmage, I was on the verge of collapse. The other fellows in the team (can't remember who specifically) were also in bad shape but I paid no attention to them."
"0114"	"I was walking along a deserted country road with two friends (both about 21). Some character walked toward us, and just as he approached, pointed to the corridor of a house (the second story). He said it will only cost you two bucks. We saw at the window sill a long haired brunette with her elbows leaning on the window sill. Her breasts hung loosely and she appeared to be very sexy. I laughed and said not for me. I walked away leaving my two buddies gaping at the window. They were roaring with laughter as they entered the house (I think)."
"0115"	"I am walking home with my gym bag in my hand (probably coming home from a basket ball game). On the other side of the street I see one of my best friends. Several guys approach him and begin starting a fight with him -- his glasses fall to the sidewalk and smash. When I see these guys attacking him, I drop my gym bag and run to his aid. I fight like one possessed, like a maddened animal, as great is my concern."
"0116"	"I was sitting at home (living room) one night listening to popular songs on the radio (portable). Suddenly it began to thunder and lightning outside. My mother (as usual) told me to shut off the radio so that no harm would be done if lightning should strike the aerial. I would not do so -- finally a bolt accompanied by a deafening roar hit the house and caused the radio to explode, shaving my face with glass, jagged plastic, etc. I looked into the mirror. My face was bloody, cut beyond recognition."
"0117"	"There was a war on. Enemy planes were flying towards Cleveland laden with atomic bombs. I was in an empty room in a watch tower and could see the planes approach on the horizon while up in this tower surrounded by 4 walls of glass. Down below I heard men shouting, i.e., in a nice green plane landing field. At first I could not hear what they said, but I finally understood that they wanted me to pull a switch in the room. It was to set off an atomic ray which would make the bombs ineffective. I reached for the switch and at the same time heard the roar of the planes. An electric shock on the handle prevented me from setting off the switch. Blinding flash. I woke up."
"0118"	"A rich man came to me on the street and showed me a suitcase full of money. He assured me that there was a million dollars in the case. He said the money is yours if you can tear this phone book In half. If you can't I will kill your mother and father. I took him up on his wager, confident of my strength. The phone book had these rubber pages which made it stretchable but not tearable. Finally upon giving up no more strength in arms, the news came that father and mother had been murdered. I vowed I would spend the rest of my life in attempting to catch the tempting villain."
"0119"	"I was walking down an abandoned street towards an old wooden home which must have been considered more or less of a mansion in former years. As I drew near I felt the urge to cross the street and avoid passing it. However I felt impelled to go past it for curiosity's sake. I did so. Suddenly a loose 2x4 near the 3rd story of the old edifice was blown loose by the wind. It came down and conked me on the head. I lay on the ground paralyzed, i.e., able to see, feel and hear but unable to move. People gathered around and finally an ambulance came and took me away."
"0120"	"I went to my clothes closet in a desperate attempt to hurry up for a party which I was supposed to attend. My friends were waiting downstairs and I tried hurriedly to dress for it. I slipped on it kept disappearing. Finally I used up all of it and I slipped on my shirt and soon that disappeared before my eyes as did my other clothes. I figured I was seeing things so I went downstairs to greet my friends the way I was. They were all shocked because I really did not have any clothes on."
"0121"	"I recall taking an examination. It seems the examination is to be very long and the time allowed short. I remember talking to a girl sitting next to me in the examination and telling her that it is no use to try and answer all the questions since everyone will fail no matter how much they complete. However, I myself am trying to complete as much as I can. The room is apparently filled with other students but they are not clear and it seems that the only people I can clearly make out are the girl sitting next to me and a man instructor standing in the front of class."
"0122"	"I was playing volleyball. It seemed that the game was held on the lawn of a cousin's house. The other participants were unknown to me however we seemed to be talking back and forth. Then we all entered a house which apparently belonged to my cousin, however I have never seen this building before. We all sat down and indulged in various activities some listened to the radio, others danced, while still others just sat and had something to drink. I recall holding a glass of something in my hand, but I don't believe that I actually drank any of the contents. After this some of the people announced they were leaving. I decided that I should stay for the night. There were members' of both sexes present."
"0123"	"The dream included two girls and a boy whom I know. One of the girls was quite a close friend of mine. However, about two weeks ago I had a misunderstanding with her and the situation remains somewhat tense. In the dream this girl seems to question me about trivial things that I can't recall. Then the other girls enters but says very little. The boy enters and he also remains quite untalkative. This girl and boy then sit down and listen to the first girl question me. Finally, I take the girl by the hand, but she still continues to quiz me."
"0124"	"The dream took place in my own home. It seemed that a strange man was living in our home. I do not know the identity of this man, nor does he resemble anyone with whom I am acquainted. However, the strange man was apparently mixed up in some type of questionable business. Whenever I tried to question him he gave me evasive answers about himself. Finally this man said that he was going to take over our home and our family must comply with his wishes. At this point my father entered the house and drove the strange man out by force."
"0125"	"I was somehow visiting the home or cabin of a mountaineer family. I had never seen this cabin or the people in it before. However, what impressed me the most was the filth and poverty in which these people lived. It seemed that there were about eight or nine people living in this one run down cabin. There were both old people and small children and apparently all belonged to the same family. They spoke to me and seemed happy. I don't believe that anything of importance was said. I can't recall speaking to them but I may have."
"0126"	"I was going to do combat with someone. In my dream my opponent and I wore armor as in knighthood days. Nothing about this seemed strange to me or my older sister who was looking on. We were both on a horse and my foe had a long lance readied. I was lacking something and wanted to get it to be prepared. I was afraid to forestall the battle to search for I thought I would be seen as a coward. I felt I could easily win the match but was bothered by not being fully prepared."
"0127"	"I was in the sitting room of a suite in which I lived 8 years ago. This was an apt. house in N.Y. I was I at the window for the purpose of telling my sister (27) who was on the opposite street (3 floors below) something which I cannot recall. However, I shook my head from side to side but my sister did not understand that I meant no to whatever matter was concerned. Whereupon I lifted the window, which was already partly open, to shout the answer and thus be understood. On the ledge (outer ledge) of the aperture were two handbags one of which (a green one) I recognizes as my sister's. In leaning out, I brushed this bag so that it started to fall to the street, but I caught it. When I had opened the window I still did not speak but shook my head as before."
"0128"	"I needed money and sought to regain money which someone owed me. I went to the man's house with my parents. I got the impression of luxury. The man was there with his wife. He was in his middle ages and a small man. He explained that he had a special cleansing or sterilizing bath for his guests (for his and our protection I thought). When I asked about the money he was willing to lend it to me (about $1,500) for a couple of months at 50% interest. I felt very outraged or rather unbelieving. I wanted the money to finance a play which I felt had the makings of a drama or a musical."
"0129"	"I was looking for entertainment in a strange city. I asked someone who was, I found out, a policeman, where I could find some card. game or saloon. He was quite friendly and told me confidentially, of place which had gambling about half of the games he told me of were pronounced in a jumble and seemed foreign to me."
"0130"	"We were just going to the car to start off for Cleveland from New York. We were carrying our belongings in valises. I had my raincoat and (I thought) a jacket on one hanger which I had on my left arm. I became cold and gave what I had in my right hand to someone to hold while I put on my jacket and coat. When I took the coat off the hangar, a dress fell from underneath. I put the dress aside and my mother remarked that I never wore enough even when I was sick. She told me to don the dress saying it would keep me warm but I threw it away."
"0131"	"I attended the Dr. I.Q. quiz show which recently appeared in Cleveland and which is on the radio on Wed. at 8 p.m. I remained tense as I waited hopefully to be a contestant. In the meantime, a queer thing happened which never takes place on the quiz show. The quiz master was replaced by his wife as quiz master after half of the program was over. I was finally called to answer a question. I can't remember what the question was or how I answered."
"0132"	"I dreamed that I was being chased by several gangsters through the streets of a small town. The streets of the town were very narrow and winding and four or five-story buildings were situation on each side of the street. I kept running down these streets, sometimes hiding in the buildings. However, most of the time I was on the run, and I began to think I would shake the gangsters off my trial. When they were just about ready to capture me, it was time to get up."
"0133"	"One night I heard my 3 year old sister crying for me. I went to her room and found her hysterical. She didn't recognize me. She must have thought I was the doctor because she kept asking me to save her. I told her that she would feel better in the morning. However, she paid no attention but simply kept on asking me to save her. "
"0134"	"I was arrested and put in a jail to serve a term of 10 years. While in jail, I began to realize that my life was ruined. I would never be a success in life with a jail sentence. I also felt that I would be an old man when my term was up and wouldn't have the opportunity to get married."
"0135"	"I was in Wade Park with 2 of my friends. We stopped to talk for a few minutes in one spot. I noticed a young couple walking hear us. Suddenly I heard a loud blast. It was a loud explosion occurring behind my back just a few feet from me. When I turned around to see what happened, I asked my friends what happened to the young couple. They pointed to the ground. I walked over to the spot where the explosion occurred and all I could see was the young man's head and part of his body scattered over the ground."
"0136"	"I lay in the top bunk of a double decker at my fraternity house. Alongside of me lay another man. I recognized him, for I had seen him on campus many times before. He lay there sleeping, chewing tobacco. I perceived his presence by the smell of his body."
"0137"	"I was walking down an unfamiliar street with one of my fraternity brothers' girl. At times we entered what seemed like delicatessen stores. There seems to have been other people present at times and they were on bicycles. At times, I remembered that I too rode a bicycle. I am not cognizant of any sexual relations with the girl. I am also unaware of any other emotional feeling or reaction. As a matter of fact I don't think I experienced any"
"0138"	"I was alone in a room which was quite unfamiliar to me. In this room I was only cognizant of one window with a shade over it. The setting of the room was of no importance to me when I was dreaming. I was standing on something in order to fasten the shade which seemed to be failing down, i.e., rolling up from the top to the bottom. The shade was trapezoid in shape. The smaller base was on the top and it was the part which I was continually trying to fasten. There is a break in my memory at this point for the next thing I remember is that I unfastened the shade at the top and inserted a light built into a light socket. The position of the light socket was under the shade, but I don't remember seeing it."
"0139"	"I was in the Albert gymnasium locker room. There were some men who seemed to be on the basketball team. One, although I do not know him personally, I had seen before. These men seemed to be in a state of rebellion although the exact nature of it is not clear. Someone gave me a knife that snaps open quickly by pressing a button on the side. I held the knife in front of me and made two of the men move. One of these men was the one I had recognized. The knife kept closing on me and I had to open it up by throwing it out with a motion of the wrist."
"0140"	"I don't remember where I was, except that I must have been in a rather small room. I was in an argument with one of my fraternity brothers. Somehow he fired an air rifle (I did not see him. I just knew he had fired it.) and I received a hole in my eyelid which I thought extended some distance into my head. I made quite a commotion of this to whomever was standing around. Next, I was waiting for a bus at a place where I had often waited in the past. There were two other men with me but I do not know who they were. The hole in my eyelid was still there."
"0141"	"I was on a highway in a car and was being chased by someone. Another person of my age was with me. We figured that we could get to a certain house before the individual who was chasing us could. At this point some thought came into my head about a motor cycle but I was unable to remember what it was about. We beat this person or persons to the house. In this room there were several other people who I knew. The group was made up of boys and girls my age. We sat there with some revolvers and waited for the men to arrive. My revolver was shaped like a cigarette lighter. When the men arrived everyone gave up their guns except me. I thought that I better keep mine in case of trouble."
"0142"	"I was shoveling some dirt from a ditch along side of the road leading to my home town. As I was shoveling a car pulled up and some of the bosses of the construction job got out of the car. One of the men appeared to be the personal manager of Sterling and Welches. When I saw him I thought I better look as if I was working hard. The man with him was the president of the fraternity. He and I went across the street and we discussed the building of a new fraternity house. I was ill at ease with him when he realized that we had exhausted the topics of conversation, he walked away and went into a house that was his home which far off in the distance."
"0143"	"My mother and my aunt stopped in at a department store to do some shopping (the outside reminded me of Taylor's). While I was waiting for them to come out I watched some colored people play a hide and seek game -- one would hide behind a pillar and the other would try to find him. After I had walked down the street quite a ways the thought came to me that I had lost my aunt and mother because I didn't get back in time to meet them where I had said I would. Later I finally did meet them. They looked as if they had gone to the hairdresser's and gotten new hairdos. told them that they looked great and that there appearances had changed. My mother told me that the hairdo's hadn't changed their appearances. When I got up close to them I agreed with her. My mother had on a cheap skimpy dress that I thought I could almost see through. I thought that I almost could see her cunt. When that thought went through my mind I thought jokingly that it was an incestuous idea. I noticed that there was hair on her leg. I didn't feel proud of her."
"0144"	"A group of boys my age and I were playing on a large field. I suggested that we play horse and rider. Some said yes that's a good game. Then a whole lot of girls my age came onto the field. I suggested the same game again and everybody took up the suggestion. The field later turned into a dance floor. I danced with one girl and we were really enjoying ourselves. While we were dancing someone put on a record that was hard to dance to. She told me that she would like to sit this one out. The guy who was taking care of the records explained to us that he put on the wrong record by mistake. I then went behind the bar. I suggested that I go over and bring back a bulletin that stated Mr. Hall was a communist."
"0145"	"I got up from bed to go to class. I found myself climbing up a hill with some fraternity brothers. We were looking for a place to go to eat breakfast. One guy told me we were going over to my roommate's house to eat. I said, ""Do they serve meals?"" Then I remembered that they had the best meals in town. I was in a car riding through a forest. With me there a few other guys my age. We saw a bear along side of the river which ran close to the road. I said look at the bear, It was probably washed up by the flood. Went on further, and I saw a pheasant. I said look at that pheasant and what's that behind it? It looks like a chicken hawk. The chicken hawk was sneaking up on the pheasant. As we went on I saw more pheasants. Before we got on to the main road leading to town, we stopped the car in order that some of the guys could get completely dressed. It irritated me that they didn't finish dressing before we left the house to go to eat."
"0146"	"My mother, father and fiancee went with me on a fishing trip. We stayed at a very old house somewhere in Kentucky. The house was half over water and was owned by hicks. We went fishing by tying strings around our finger and used pickles as bait. I caught a large catfish. The hicks told us the fishing was good because they made pickles and stored them in their basement which was in the water. The fish were attracted by the smell or flavor of the pickles and always stayed near the house."
"0147"	"I was on a bike near a small concrete bridge. Someone else was with me. It might have been my fiancee, but I cannot be sure. A group of bicycle riders went past me. I got on my bike and began riding at the end of the group. We rode across the bridge and up a narrow path which wound around a small conical shaped mountain. As we rode I noticed the water which had been in the river was rising upward as we rose higher and had changed into an ocean surrounding the mountain or pinnacle. No fears or emotions seemed to accompany this strange phenomena."
"0148"	"I was standing on one bank of a river looking at a structure on the other side. The structure was in the general shape of a barn, but was of a light cream color and of a modern design. Suddenly I was on the barn side of the river and was watching a little girl who had swallowed a nail. (Her body and features were that of a small girl, but somehow she seemed to be older.) Her brother was there and was going to use a small suction pump to remove the nail from her stomach. He attached the suction pump on her mouth and played an organ while the pump was working. (I was not conscious of any sounds however.) The little girl fainted (or something similar) and the nail fell to the ground. (We were standing ankle deep in water all this time.) I was shocked when the nail fell into the water onto the ground and I stared at the nail for some time."
"0149"	"I was in our attic with one unidentified male companion. There was a large box full of coal which was supposedly a furnace of some sort. I raked over the coals with a long pool bridge to see if I could start a fire. (Had played pool recently). The fire started and began to flame very high (was not conscious of heat). Flames were somewhat confined by cardboard which didn't seem to burn. When flames reached ceiling we looked for fire extinguisher. Male companion get extinguisher which was hanging up in rafters; got it by climbing up in rafters; handed it down to me (hose type extinguisher). Extinguisher was leaking fluid and we weren't sure we could use it to put out fire. Was not panicky due to fire; didn't seem important after we got the extinguisher."
"0150"	"I was carrying my three year old niece in my arms in a department store. The store seemed to be a woods part of the time. I stopped to look at a velvet cardboard with several diamond rings sticking in it. (like in jewelry stores) No one was around and I was tempted to steal one. I didn't though. I carried my niece up the stairs in the department store and when we got fairly high up I got dizzy on the stairs. I was afraid I would fall."
"0151"	"My father, brother (17) and I were traveling to Toledo (actually the road was to Buffalo) in our car. We stopped at the house of an acquaintance of my father's and looked in the window. A party was going on. We went in and were invited to stay. I started to flirt with some girls of my own age (strange to me) and sat down with one of them. She got up when I started to make love to her. Another girl (wearing nothing but an open vest and a skirt) sat down with me and flirted. I caressed her breasts."
"0152"	"I woke up in bed and had to go to the bathroom. The house was different than my house. It had rnodern furnishings as are in some movies and magazines. The bathroom door was ajar after I was ~.n it and I could see my brother through the door coming out of his room (14). When I closed the door the remaining two inches, it became solid instead of transparent. I could hear my parents talking to my brother, telling him to hurry up and clean the walks before the snow melted. When I went to my room there were many people in it including a radical standing on my bed making a speech. Someone chased the radical (young man) away."
"0153"	"I was a spy in a house in which there seemed to be a party. I didn't know why I was spying. I sat on the edge of a chair in which a man was sitting and decided to pretend to be a woman. I flirted with him and then left for the bathroom. On the way through the kitchen I saw some coffee and yelled to the man to ask him if he wanted some coffee. The house was the one in which I lived as a child. I went to the bathroom and undress. A woman knocked at the door and asked for something. I handed it to her through the door (opened a crack). The man was about 26 and a stranger. I didn't see the bathroom door but I I felt that she was in her twenties and a stranger."
"0154"	"I was walking around in a tough neighborhood with a group of friends (fraternity brother). As I walked I picked up heavy sticks until in my right hand I carried a large knife and five sticks. We crossed several individuals who looked as if they wanted a fight. We met a group of boy scouts (men of all ages) and passed them. Suddenly I seemed to realize that, the boy scouts were actually enemy soldiers invading us. I rushed back, alone, to warn our army and found that they had surrounded the enemy. We were on a group of hills around the enemy in the plain. I took a gun and started to shoot. The countryside turned into a large machine like a tank. We were on a raised portion of it and the enemy were sitting in a large section in the middle of it. After we had fired at them, we jumped down and to our surprise were captured by the enemy who were still alive. Then as an onlooker I watched loaded airplanes fly out of the machine to attack the country."
"0155"	"I was in a basement of a strange house with a 18-year-old girl whom I date occasionally. One of my fraternity brothers (some year as I am) and I were locking all the doors. I was going to sleep with the girl that night while my frat brother kept guard. Then the scene switched. Instead of sleeping in the basement we were going to sleep in a cabin on top of a 30 foot pole in the middle of a field. (The field was one in which I played football as a young child.) We climbed up a large ladder, carrying blankets to the cabin. Several other people were on the ground, watching (strangers). The girl fell to the ground from about 20 feet up the ladder and was unhurt. I remarked that, she must very athletic as she didn't get killed."
"0156"	"I dreamt that I was in, the lounge in the basement of Adelbert and suddenly the thought occurred to me that I had my final speech in Speech 200 togive the next period and that I wasn't prepared. I got very panicky and began to sweat and to moan what am I going to do. I woke up with a start. There were other students in the room but they were shadowy background figures."
"0157"	"I walked out of the washroom at our country club and it suddenly hit me that I was being married immediately. Sure enough I was in a cutaway coat, etc. I remember looking out across the main lounge andseeing a mob of people all dressed up. Suddenly I got panicky and decided to run out. I saw my girlfriend coming down the stairs on her father's arm and I yelled ""I'm sorry but I just can't"" and then left running rapidly."
"0158"	"My two roommates were in Cleveland over a Christmas holiday. I only saw one of them but I sensed that both of them were there. I was making a phone call to a girl I know to fix the second one up with her when I suddenly realized that he couldn't possibly be here since he had been killed. Then I felt like a fool."
"0159"	"I knew that some horrible catastrophe was going to happen. There was an air of doom. I remember running up a street screaming and moaning that the world was going to end. I looked up in the sky and saw a meteor or comet coming closer and closer. I ran into a garage and lay on the floor of the garage. There was a mechanic and 2 or 3 other men there. I yelled at them that the end was here but they only said we know, we know and did nothing. They seemed very blase."
"0160"	"I was sitting in the back of a car with my hands an overcoat and slouching down in the seat. I was flanked by my two roommates from Northwestern. Sitting on the end by the door was a fellow in my physics class at Reserve whom I don't even know. All of a sudden one rommmate turned to this kid whom he addressed as Katz and told him curtly to leave the three of us alone, saying he didn't have much time. Katz very docilely left."
"0161"	"I go into a drug store and demand a tube of Ipana toothpaste. The saleslady tells me that they don't stock Ipana. As a matter of fact it's about the only paste they don't stock, she tells me. Why? She takes a tube of paste, presses it, but the paste doesn't come out of the usual orifice but from a cut in the tube (as one sometimes finds with an old tube). This is indicative of the trouble they've been having with Ipana. I can't remember whether I finally purchased a tube of paste."
"0162"	"I So to the house of a music teacher to take lessons. On the wall he has a chart (like an oculist's letter chart) with which he is going to test my musical ability since I have never taken lessons before. These charts have pictures on them. For example one shows a rocket and the question is whether I know how the rocket works. He also asks me whether I know Spanish. Later I ask him whether with the violin or the piano and he says that we'll begin on the reed instruments. I am very nosy in his house and examine all the papers on his desk."
"0163"	"I'm watching the ocean with a friend (male). I trip and fall down a sandy slope, but manage to hold on a projection (a remnant of a dead tree sticking out), so that I don't fall into the water. I think of the cold water below me and the possibility of my falling into the cold water while clambering up the sandy slopes. I feel that even if I did fall into the water I would swim but at the same time I consider the possibility of freezing in the water. However, I get safely to the top with the help of my friend."
"0164"	"I go to a play rehearsal with a friend. A high school acquaintance Makes a speech introducing a girl who I also know, who in turn gives some sort of talk and I marvel at her Stage presence. There's a blank here. At the end of the rehearsal (I am not a participant at the rehearsal) I see a girl I know quite well, escorted by a fellow who I also know (and dislike) coming down the aisle of the auditorium. I do not greet them but I note with regret that they are identically dressed. My friend goes up to the girl and performs some minor act of intimacy of which I'm intensely jealous. As a matter of fact I did not realize he knew her so well."
"0165"	"I was in a classroom; the instructor was lecturing to a very small claps or about three or four students. The lecturer was wandering and a friend of mine in the class put on his coat and was about to walk out. The instructor mildly reprimanded him for walking out before the class was adjourned. The student apologized saying he thought the class had already been adjourned. Later, assignment sheets were handed out. Mine consisted of an envelope containing a children's shoe. I looked at the shoes and wondered whether in this course we would be concerned with multiple correlation techniques. Somehow in the shoe I could see to what extent multiple correlation would be. involved."
"0166"	"At the beginning of the dream I found myself in some sort of a large room midst many people who are busily preparing for some sort of performance, and one lady leads me to a drum and asks me to play the drum part to several pieces that they are going to perform. Among all the people I can only identify one, an Israeli about 40 years old whom I once knew. I soon found out I was on a boat -- a boat docked in the harbor oil Jaija, Israel. I go up on deck and find out that the Israel-Arab war is starting. I then see many disconnected war scenes from the Israel war, the blowing up of a bridge north of Haija, a naval battle off Haija with the Egyptians, etc. I am quite excited and I fly around the boat and around the bay area in order to get a better view of the naval battle. It seems that there are many middle aged women on the boat who are also quite excited."
"0167"	"I was sitting in a classroom of the Hebrew school. As I was sitting there the director came in and mentioned that he might be able to give me a permanent job. He then began going through his desk, apparently looking for some card or piece of paper which I thought was probably a report on how I had done with the class I taught. Before he found the card I woke up."
"0168"	"I was sitting in a drug store eating a sundae with a bunch of young people whom I don't know. I began to talk with one of the girls who was interested in going to Israel. While coming to the drug store we had passed a huge building that was in the process of being built by the most modern methods and I made an aside that I wish we could build as quickly in Israel. The girl started to talk about this when we were in the drug store, and I mentioned to her that we didn't so much need skilled engineers and contractors as we did good fast workers, bricklayers with experience, etc., and also modern equipment. She agreed with a me and said she would try to learn bricklaying."
"0169"	"I was sitting in an auditorium listening to some sort of light musical review. During the program some man yells out and painting to a negro seated several rows behind me yells there's Paul Robeson. Immediately many men congregate near him, and they looked like reporters to me. I looked carefully at the negro and decided that he wasn't actually Robeson and that they in their excitement had mistaken some other person for the singer. Suddenly the reporters changed into armed guards with browning automatics. Another person in another part of the room got up and started to make for the door. They brutally shot him down. Sadistically standing over him, and machine gunning him after he, was dead. 1 got excited and yelled out you could blooded bastards and the audience which during the shooting had not even turned their heads from the performance, looked at me coldly."
"0170"	"I was on a farm and one of the rows broke out. She was fast and I was afraid to try and stop her. But because I didn't, all of the cows started to break out of their stalls. There was great general confusion, all the other people had to come out and help round Up the herd. I was standing in a line where we were passing some small animals from one to the other toward the barn. After several of these small animals had been passed up, they started to pass up a stretcher with a dead man on it, apparently killed by a stampeding cow."
"0171"	"A gangster is running berserk through the streets shooting everybody in sight, and getting a. great deal of pleasure out of it. Then suddenly the gangster merges into myself and I find myself running to avoid retaliation by the law. I am no longer berzerk but quite rational, and seemingly able to understand the full consequences of what I had done. I remember that one of the people I had shot with a sub machine gun was a fraternity brother of mine whom I disliked a good deal. I recalled that I had kept on shooting, but that he just wouldn't die. Finally he did. I had the feeling of relief. I did not want to be caught, so I tried to shoot myself, but that didn't work. Then I tried to take arsenic, and was conscious of a terrific pain in my side (presumably from the poison but I couldn't die. Then I began to think of how happy I had been in the last few days, and I didn't want to die. Somehow the police didn't know it was me who did the killing and I was going to bluff them out."
"0172"	"I was in my apartment, and while I was looking out the window, I saw an old girlfriend of mine come in the front door. I waved at her to wait for me, and that I would be right down. I tried to hurry, but was conscious of the sensation that I was very late. When I got downstairs, she was eating the people she was visiting. From then on, everything I did went wrong. I wanted very much to make an excellent impression, but was simply unable to. I went to get her a glass of water, and when I opened the cabinet the door I slammed back making a loud noise. I seemed unable to control my hands or motions. When I turned on the water it came pouring out. Then I dropped the glass with a loud smash. My hands had either too much strength, or too little strength. I could sense the feeling of disgust that the people in the room must have felt toward me. I remember feeling disgusted with myself."
"0173"	"The dream opens in the midst of a Milton Berle rehearsal. Milton Berle gets into an argument with one of his employees. The man gets very mad, and takes out of a box a long, black, horrible snake. The snake appears to be almost human in intelligence and rationalization. Berle is extremely afraid of the snake. The man goes but he leaves the snake behind him. Every time Berlie makes a move, the snake watches him with apprehensive eyes. The snake then began to purposely annoy Berle in an almost human fashion. It would crawl toward Berle in a sort of motion, Berle would be very frightened and run and jump all over the furniture. While running he would be frantically holding on to the mike. He would be continually trying to continue the show in a horribly frightened way. It was sheer frustration at its utmost. I myself was frieghtened while dreaming it."
"0174"	"As the scene opens I seem to be balancing a while sitting down. After a few minutes I decided to stand up and balance it from a standing position on the edge. All of a sudden, two large boats came into the picture and I tried to go around them. Then everything turned into large boats in a sort of a maze. At first they were all friendly toward each other, and then the first two large boats became hostile over something. I tried to tell the captain of the first boat something helpful about the other boat, but he refused to listen. I had a feeling of disgust and anger, and turned to join sides with the other boat. I was refused here also, but another man who resembled a casual friend of mine was welcomed aboard. He laughed loudly and boarded the ship."
"0175"	"I was staring at a football when for some reason it turned into a sheep. It was a full size sheep with a sheep's body, but its neck was made of the lace of a football. The lace, however, had been bent, as often is the lace of a football, and the sheep's head seemed to be too heavy' for the bent lace. In the dream I loved the sheep and would continually hold it and pet it. As long as I held the sheep and loved it, the lace neck held up the head. When I stopped holding it, the head would fall down again. I had the feeling of being quite worried about the poor bent neck and a fear of letting it go because the head would fall off. I wanted very much to do something about it, and felt very bad when I couldn't."
"0176"	"I was in a foreign country, in a hotel. As I was leaving the room, a pretty elevator operator who closely resembled somebody I know (I still can't make the connection) warned me that I was in danger. I can remember running through the lobby and out into. the street. Twomen started to chase me, shooting as they ran. Then as I continued running, the street scene melted away and one huge man was chasing me around a race track. As he gained, I found that although I was running was not moving. Just as he was about to overtake me, I woke up in a sweat."
"0177"	"I approached a small unpainted shack by walking through a field. Inside the shack, which resembled a church in that it was arranged with pews, I saw 5 of my friends and immediately began a gun battle with them in which I was fighting against all five. I would fire at each one of them and always hit them but they would never fall. Then I jumped through a window and ran through a field toward an armored car. While running I noticed two dogs and a small child. I tossed some money to the child and he agreed to sic the dogs after the five pursuers who were shooting at me. I jumped into the car."
"0178"	"I was a mailman delivering mail in the vicinity of Euclid and Forest Hills Blvd. near Superior. I had on nothing except the mail bag. I went to several apartments. I dreaded meeting anyone and when I, did I felt very anxious but they didn't seem to notice. I felt irritated by not having any clothes. Then I crossed the street and entered a store which was a kitchen on the inside. This was the post office. I then pressed a secret button and entered a secret part of the building which was more like a post office. I met no one I knew and spoke to no one. Also no one seemed to notice/me."
"0179"	"We (the family) were sitting on the first floor. My father, sitting at the head of the dining room table suddenly rose, shrieked, and collapsed onto the floor. He turned completely white. When I reached the scene my mother and sister were bending over him. I pushed them away and kneeled down beside him. It seems as if he was suffering a heart attack and I took it for granted he was dying. My mother and sister were crying and I was pleading for him to be all right when I woke."
"0180"	"As the dream began a fraternity brother of mine, Herman Scher, was riding a horse across a field. As I rode up to him, I saw a bolt of lightning coming down toward him. I was also on horseback and I rode desperately to try and warn him to avoid the slowly descending bolt. felt secret elation however that the bolt was not directed toward me. The bolt struck Herman, but in some way I to wa's injured. It seems that I lost consciousness. When I awoke, I was laying on a cot in the field. Next to me, and in similar bandages, were Herman, and another friend and teammate on the basketball squad, John Kappos. Before us was a huge television screen and an indistinguishable figure was asking us if it was correctly tuned. "
"0181"	"I was in command of a canoe leaving a port. The men under me did as I told them to do, but grudgingly. Once away from the view of higher authorities, they all abandoned the canoe and finally hid it. They played around the pool or lake swimming, diving, etc., while I stood an the edge and yelled at them. They wouldn't listen. However, one finally brought the canoe back, but they still wouldn't get back in and row away as I tried to make them do. I was aware that thecanoe was a reddish brown."
"0182"	"A street runs parallel to the Ohio River in Pittsburgh (on the south bank). Over the street is a pedestrian bridge, and on the street are two extra large safety zones with stairways leading up to the pedestrian bridge. I was driving along heading directly for the safety zone."
"0183"	"I was hitchhiking to Michigan with a friend of mine (19) somewhere in southwestern PA. When we were about halfway there we ran into a fellow (16) whom I know lives at our destination. He had bought the car which had at one time been owned by the fellow with whom I was hitchhiking. The car had been shipped to the farm in parts, but was not yet assembled. We tried to rent it for $25, but were unable to do so."
"0184"	"I was walking with a friend of mine who is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. When he was a junior, he was a member of the organization sponsored by Phi Beta Kappa for scholastically superior college juniors. In the dream, contrary to what actually happened, some member of the faculty held up his election into Phi Beta Kappa. His comment was, ""at least I'm still a member of ________,"" the organization for juniors. I do not know where or when this conversation was supposed to have taken place."
"0185"	"I dreamed that my brother (23) drove into the driveway of our home in my car and that the horn was blowing. I was standing beside the back porch steps with my mother and as the car approached us I yelled to him, ""pull out the button, you fool."""
"0186"	"Last night I dreamt that I was playing bridge in the middle of the Adelbert main walk with JS (fraternity brother, 19). The other players were unidentifiable. At 12 o'clock I ran into the Adelbert main building to see Dean Jones to take him to our fraternity for lunch, but I returned to continue playing bridge until 1 o'clock, when I again dashed into the Adelbert building to call someone at my fraternity to say I was unable to bring Jones over for lunch. I don't remember ever seeing Jones in the dream."
"0187"	"I was walking with CF (fraternity brother, 22) out in the country about 10 in the morning. I wanted to turn, back but he said we could walk further and still be back in time to get Jones. We then suddenly arrived at West Point and CF turned into GM (fraternity brother who had gone to military school) and I asked GM about the outfits of the officers and cadets. I then saw it was 12:20 and I ran for a while to a phone but I couldn't got my number. I finally called the operator and got the number of the fraternity. I told the brothers I was at West Point and couldn't take Jones over to the house. They said he was there and having a good time so I had nothing to worry about. "
"0188"	"I was on a bus going through New York City. As we approached the country a woman guide of about 30 said that we should notice something high up on a mountain. I had an aisle seat and crawled into the aisle, putting my head next to the floor in order that I might see the top of the mountain to see what the guide told us to notice. I still couldn't see the object of interest. This made me feel cheated as everyone else in the bus was exclaiming at the beautiful sight and I was the only one to miss the view."
"0189"	"I was on a hot deserted country dirt road with no trees in sight. I was walking back to New York so I might go to Europe. I had been home from Europe and was now going back for a second time. I then came to a large island in the center of the road. The island was in the form of a perfect circle, and on one side there was a bleak house. I walked behind the house and got a drink from a well. Suddenly, I was walking along another country road only this was a cool and tree-lined road."
"0190"	"It was night and I was coming to my home and Jones was just leaving and telling someone his thanks. I entered the house and the DG arrived (an instructor at school, m 40). There was a break or lull in the dream but next thing I remember was FB (also an instructor at Reserve, a woman about 50) and she was leaving at night in a bad rain storm. I was cautioning her to be very careful lest she fall and hurt herself."
"0191"	"I was picked up by a group of fellows who I went to high school with while I was waiting for a bus. I had a pair of baseball shoes on. We were talking and the one fellow (about 20) started to say that my old girlfriend was engaged, but stopped when he thought I might be hurt by this news. I told him I knew all about this event. We all climbed out of the car together."
"0192"	"I was on some battleground somewhere. The enemy was supposed to charge. They were very near. I got some sort of job on a battleship. We took the ship to some various ports in the West Indies. A quick change of scenery and I again was on the battlefront. Everyone was preparing to charge and surprise the enemy. The enemy troops. however. surprised us, and we could see them pouring over a hill which was in front of us."
"0193"	"I was a bookkeeper for some firm downtown. My boss was Carl Helms, 51, an old boss I had when I worked before entering college. Instead of posting accounts or figures I remember myself pasting pictures in a scrapbook with scotch tape. I had difficulty tearing off the scotch tape with my teeth and also sticking the pictures on the page."
"0194"	"I own a new Chevrolet. I drove it around the corner and then parked it near by a house I lived in 10 years ago. When I came back, I discovered the car was missing. I then realized I had forgotten to remove the key. After a while I went to the house I used to live in. It was a double house and I knew the people who lived downstairs. I asked her if she knew anything about the car. She didn't. As I was leaving, the lady upstairs called to me and told me the police were holding t he car and it would cost $70 to regain the car from the police."
"0195"	"I entered a huge stadium just like the one at Ohio State. We were supposed to play for the intramural touch football championship. At the half time of the game, I climbed up the stairs to talk to some friends whom I didn't remember. Since I only played offense, I stayed on the sidelines and shouted instructions on what plays were coming and telling the players, who were all my fraternity brothers, what type of defense to use."
"0196"	"My roommate and I lived together in an old one-roomed house. The house was very comfortable, though, inside. The area at this place was very remote as far as neighbors were concerned, but there are trees and streams there. Our house was located where an old dynamite shed is located (in the real setting). I was a little provoked at my roommate's messy habits of leaving everything lying around in a chaotic manner. Despite this I was happy to remain there. Finally my roommate decided to leave because it was so desolate. I should have been sorry to see him go, but I felt glad to be left alone in this small house. I remember that it was hard to get to and from this place, because of a marshy area that had to be crossed. After my roommate left, I took life easy and actually was very happy loafing. Then people began to come back to see me, children mostly. They wanted to see how I was. I felt that I was obliged to entertain these people's curious desire to see me and even was glad when they came, but I began to feel as though I was separating from society, turning into an oddity."
"0197"	"My mother gave me some christmas cards and other articles to deliver to our neighbors. It seems that some of the cards had been delivered to our house by mistake. I started out and delivered them to the various houses, which were all familiar, but the people didn't seem to be anyone whom I knew. It was snowing out and I remember that I wasn't too happy about the weather. After delivering the last letter or package, I'm not sure which it was, I had a golf club left and no one to take it to. Therefore I began walking toward town; here an automobile pulled up beside me and I began talking to the man, who was no one I recognized, about golf and the activities of the country club. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was on the golf course watching the golfers. It was a happy feeling, no responsibility, and I seemed to be in my element. Then I went up to the club house. The club house seemed fascinating to me, just like It did when I was bout 6 years old, and I enjoyed being around it as if it were some sort of pleasure which I haven't felt for years. Then I went into the club house and my brother was playing the slot machines, which I disapprove of. However, when I entered, he had a great stroke of luck and money (nickels) was coming from every one he played. We filled our pockets and then left."
"0198"	"A friend of mine introduced me to this girl who had a very sexy appearance. Immediately I managed to get a date with the girl for that evening at 8. The situation was very pleasing. I made arrangements for my transportation, money and everything else. A friend was going to lend me his car, which would be parked around the corner from the Daily Times (our local newspaper office). At about 20 to 8, I started to go to pick the girl up. This gave me plenty of time. However, I stopped at the pool room and ended up talking to the proprietor, whom I know quite well. All the time I knew that I had this date, but I kept on talking with various friends whom I met there. I now wanted to leave as it was 5 till 8. I had the girl's. telephone number and had to call her to find out out how to get to her house, as I had forgotten by that time. I tried to dial her number which I had on a piece of paper, but I kept making blunders. I couldn't seem to dial the number correctly, though I tried numerous times. This became very frustrating. I decided to start out and stop off on the way to call, because I knew in what section she lived. Yet knowing this I started out in the opposite direction. I stooped to call again with no better results. My moves were clumsy and finally it was 9 and too late to get her so I had to give the venture up because here the dream ended. I wanted to take the girl for sensual reasons, but my body actions seemed to be competing against me."
"0199"	"I was, living here in Cleveland in a fraternity house, but it was located in a downtown section. My fraternity brothers were fellows I used to know back home except one who I remember as being a fellow I know from Cleveland. I was upstairs cleaning up around. Then I came downstairs and found a lot of colored people there. Right away I noticed they had lipstick on, and this struck me as being peculiar. I couldn't help staring; once when I noticed that I was watching them, they attempted to hide their faces, some did at least. There were a bunch of dogs with them also. The dogs had fleas or something and were spreading an epidemic of disease in the neighborhood. I realized that I had to get serum to stop the epidemic. I didn't know where to get the serum. I had no transportation and went back to the fraternity house, but no one had any transportation. One fellow lent me his bicycle, so I started. I went about one block and saw a buddy of mine driving a bus, so I laid my bicycle down and asked him to take me. He said he couldn't, so I went back to get the bicycle and someone had stolen it. Finally another friend came by in a car and I got in. We started off."
"0200"	"This dream took place in back of my home. I was in the army and defending the area against the Japanese, or some Asian group. There were six or seven other soldiers with me, and I remember several of them were my friends here at school. I went out into the field before me which extended about 40 yards before the ground level rises to form a hill. It seems that the enemy was located on the other side of the hill. I was very frightened, in a feeling of helplessness more than real fear. I no sooner started out than I could see the enemy beginning to advance. I quickly went back to the rest of the group to stand off the attack. I took my rifle and began shooting at the enemy. I shot them with no effect and I found that I had not taken the safety off the gun. Now I was out of ammunition, as I borrowed some from the soldiers around me. Now when I shot, the advancing enemy would be killed. The other soldiers now seemed to be doing very little and I was defending the whole group. The enemy soldiers would almost get to me and I would kill them. I had no moral compunctions about killing them, but a feeling of to kill or be killed, along with a feeling that they were making me kill them. Finally I had killed enough so that the remainder retreated. As soon as the enemy retreated, three men came up to me and said to one another, ""this is the one,"" pinning a medal on me. I felt good but that turned to fear, like now every one of the enemy would be out to get me. Our group then retreated back to our house. A new group of the enemy attacked from the rear, but I saw them soon enough to give warning and avert a surprise attack. At this point I killed a man with my bare hands (a knife that is). This being the first time I had ever done anything like this. I viewed his body afterwards, and felt no pity whatsoever. Then the dream changed into some other theme."
"0201"	"I was playing football with a group of young men mostly my own age. The person playing full back, however, was my father. We were all dressed in old shirts and trousers. We began to line up for a defensive play and I was playing right half-back alongside my father. As we lined up, I had just stooped over when my father reached over and slapped me on the back and said slash in there, slash in like hell. There seemed to be much excitement all around."
"0202"	"I was walking between 105th and 107th on Euclid Ave. with a fraternity brother of the same age as mine. I had a blue sweater on; he was wearing a gray sweater. I cannot remember which of my fraternity brothers it was, however as we were walking along, in a rather silly mood, a large woman of 55 approached us from the opposite direction. She was wearing high heels and a brown suit, the jacket of which appeared too small for her enormous bust line. She had deep lines in her forehead and around her mouth and wore too much make up. This friend and I both saw her simultaneously and let out a giggle. We felt embarrassed. I did anyway, and hurried past her to look back and begin laughing once again. There were many people on the sidewalks. The next instant I was at my girl's apartment sitting next to her on a sofa. I exclaim, ""Oh honey. You should have seen the enormous woman I saw today."" There was no color."
"0203"	"I was in some kind of a new modern restaurant. My girl, her parents, and I were on one side of the restaurant. When I was by myself on the other side, there I saw a girl I knew through high school but have not seen for several years. She was seated and I sat down and began talking to her. She asked me to go to a dance with her on Jan. 18. I said I couldn't as I had another engagement. I got up to leave her then said somewhat sadly that I was engaged now."
"0204"	"I was walking across campus and was approaching the corner of Mather gym when I noticed a crowd of girls and a few boys, all my own age, standing in front of the gym. I was dressed in a brown suit and light green hat, which I recognized. As I walked past the crowd, there was a lot of laughter and I took off my hat and looked at it to see if anything was wrong. I kept on walking through."
"0205"	"I remember seeing Thwing Library and I was standing near the psychology building. Next I was standing facing my father who was saying in a discouraging tone, ""You'll never be a doctor."" We were facing one another and there were no surroundings that I can remember. There was no color either."
"0206"	"I was in a card game (poker) with some of my high school buddies and I was winning a lot. A clock strikes in the distance and I say I have to leave. After a brief argument I leave. When I am home I count my winnings, and I am surprised that I have won 1/16 of a million dollars."
"0207"	"I was in a gym, running around and jumping. Suddenly I ran into a small boy about 3 or 4 years old. My knee hit his mouth and a tooth of his was broken. He started to cry and I picked him up to soothe him. His parents came up and I paid them for the dental work that I guessed had to be done (there probably would be none, but I still gave them money). Later I found out that one of my front teeth was loosened and would have to be removed. My aunt (30) and uncle (33) came with me to a dentist and it was done."
"0208"	"My sister (19) and I are in an old dark tailor shop. I am explaining the alterations I would like to have made on a pair of pants. After this is done I walk down a flight of stairs. Suddenly I realize I am alone and go running back to see what has happened to my sister. She is sprawled out on the floor behind a counter apparently unconscious."
"0209"	"The setting of the dream is a tall building of red brick. Inside are cages of chickens and ducks. A pharmacist about 50 years old, from the drug store that I work at on weekends and myself are crawling around inside the cages going from one to another. A fire breaks out in the lower part of the building and he advises me to use the fire escape but I decide to get down to the ground floor by means of an elevator. Two women, about 30, and I get down to the bottom level but the door jams and it is only after much struggling with it that it can be pried open enough for us to squeeze through to safety."
"0210"	"A high school buddy of mine and myself are painting my car a bright red. This is in my backyard. The car is an old convertible and the leather seats are old and dried out. Although I tell him not to do it he rubs vaseline hair tonic on the seats and this burns holes in the leather."
"0211"	"There was a very large military cemetery. A priest was standing in the middle of the cemetery. There were hundreds of people along a fence that enclosed the cemetery. They were all serious but no one was crying. As I watched these people I thought of Carrie in Dreisek's Sister Carrie. I can't remember now what I was thinking about Carrie except that her name kept running through my mind. The dream finally faded away. During the night I had several other dreams and I was conscious of the fact that I had to remember them but I can only recall the one."
"0212"	"During the night I had several dreams but I can only remember one clearly. A boyfriend and I were on a bridge. A small child had drowned and police had just brought the child to the surface of the water. The child was wrapped in a large blue blanket. As my friend and I stood on the bridge and watched, Dr. Boone's two little girls came to identify the child. They waded into the water and unwrapped the dead child. Mrs. Boone appeared on the bank in a red two-piece dress and told her girls not to look at the child too long because they might cry. My friend and I laughed and threw the two Boone children candy. Then we found out that the drowned child was my friend's brother who died 18 years ago. We decided not to tell his mother and then left."
"0213"	"I dreamed I saw a house whose eaves were burning. I thought this was very strange that only the eaves were burning. As I stood there watching, an old man came up to me and said, ""Don't worry, that house has been burning that way as long as I can remember."" Then some women came running out of the house crying, ""Call the fire department."" Just then a fire truck rolled up and the firemen began to put out the fire. I don't remember them using any fire equipment other than the truck, but the fire was soon out and the house showed no signs of damage. The old man disappeared and the women who came out of the house invited me in and said it surely was a good thing I happened to be passing by."
"0214"	"The dream took place in a railroad station. I was standing on the platform talking to a boyfriend about my age. Across the tracks there was a cage of animals that attracted my attention. Somehow I suddenly found myself in front of the cage watching elephants at a fair. The trains started coming in but I paid no attention to them. I do not remember how the dream ended."
"0215"	"I was standing in front of the school cafeteria and somehow pricked my finger. Then I was suddenly standing in front of the fireplace at the frat house. My finger was sore so I tied a string around it in order to see it more clearly. Then I saw what I thought was a very short hair right under the surface of the skin of my finger. I tried to pull it out but it began to more and went through my hand, up my arm and to my shoulder. As it began to move I saw that it had an illuminous head. this particular night it was my turn to help with the supper dishes of the frat house. I told one of the boys I would have to wash the dishes then because I had to see a doctor about the thing in my finger. We walked out into the backyard which looked like a desert. There were dishes on all sides that had to be washed but none were dirty. After a short while I got the dishes washed, borrowed a red bicycle and left for the doctor's office."
"0216"	"I dreamed that I had a bath towel over my shoulders and that by flapping the towel I could fly like a bird. Several times during the dream I took off from the sidewalk and ascended to the height of a house. After circling around the street I would land safely and try again. Although I never fell, I was worried that the ""wings"" would fail me once in the air. Above the street was a mass of telephone wires, communication wires, and electric streetcar wires. In flying up from the sidewalk I had to get through all these wires and was therefore extremely anxious that I would become entangled. At the end of the dream I was roller skating down the street with a gang of kids after me."
"0217"	"My buddy (age 25, male) and I went to a pier on a lake or ocean. My buddy got into a boat with another person and rowed away from the pier. I attached a piece of shrimp to some fishing tackle and threw the line over the edge of the pier. Almost immediately I caught a large fish about 5 feet long and had to struggle hard to bring it in. Since I seldom fish and do not like the sport, I was exceedingly pleased with my accomplishment. Although I thought the fish was dead, it was only pretending. I carried the fish to a shack at the end of the pier, but it had turned into a bear and was alive. The bear was preparing to attack me and I picked up a pen knife and started plunging it into his body. Finally, I subdued the animal by puncturing his heart (red blood gushed out). I felt sad, however, because the bear skin was so full of holes that it couldn't be used for a coat."
"0218"	"A friend (25, m), an unidentified person, and I went to the back door of a nightclub. After descending a flight of stairs in darkness we entered a large room. It seemed that a party was going on, but only a few couples were there. They were dancing near the door which we had come in. On the other side of the room was a raised platform with chairs arranged in a semicircle for a symphony orchestra. A few of the chairs were occupied. My friend began to play classical music on the piano picking out each note slowly. I was surprised because he had never played classics before. At the foot of the piano was a basket filled with uncooked pieces of meat. I began picking up hams and roasts and then putting them back in the basket."
"0219"	"At the start of the dream I was sitting at a table with my parents eating mashed potatoes. The table was out in the street in front of our house. On each plate was a pile of potatoes about three feet high and I imagined that these potatoes were made from the insides of snakes. I then saw an automobile coming down the street and wondered how it would get past the table. The scene then changed. My car was parked in a vacant field and I had lost the keys. I spent a long time looking for the keys but never found them. I then noticed that both of the rear tires were flat. I fixed the tires, but my father ridiculed me since I didn't have any keys to operate the car. Again the scene changed. I was in Korea operating a side show. My act involved the use of two serpents. I would twist and contort one of the serpents while the other rested. I would then repeat the act with the other serpent."
"0220"	"This dream was rather short involving only a few incidents, but was one of the most terrifying dreams I've had. At the start of the dream I was standing alone on a wooded hillside. The area seemed to have been burned over and stumps of trees dotted the landscape. Suddenly a wild boar appeared on the scene. Its face was generalized, but the white tusks showed. The boar started chasing me and I ran for dear life. As I ran the tusks moved closer and I was sure that I would be gored. With the boar at my heels I barely managed to get behind a tree and my heart felt as if it was going to stop from fright. At the side of the wood I noticed a piece of machinery with a flat surface and a vertical saw. The boar climbed up on the machine and was sawed in half. An elephant then appeared and swallowed the boar whole like a snake. The elephant then stretched out its legs and I woke up."
"0221"	"I was being chased for what seemed a long time. At times I was running and other times I was in an automobile. My pursuer seemed to change from one person to another; however I could recognize none of them. The pursuer was male. Finally I entered the house where I lived and in so doing found that I was cornered. Suddenly I found my service pistol (.45 cal., automatic) in my hand. As I was running up the stairs to escape I turned to shoot my pursuer. At that time his visage became clear. He was a professor of mine from the physics department of the university. I tried to pull the trigger, but it seemed frozen. As I tried to pull it with the use of both my hands, I was about to be pounced on. At that point I awakened."
"0222"	"I was in a military headquarters in Nancy, France where I had served a number of years. I had the unpleasant duty of being officer of the day. I called a very good friend of mine to see if he would mind taking my place. I received no apparent answer. After being on duty for three days without relief (usual tour of duty - 24 hours) I approached the adjutaret and claimed that his duty roster was not correct. No answer was received. Then I tried to call someone else. I had his telephone number on a piece of paper in my mind. Each time I dialed, I received a wrong number. After an infinite number of calls I gave up. Later I helped a friend move to a new apartment and became completely exhausted. Everyone in the dream was male."
"0223"	"I was in a large room which contained a large number of desks. It also seemed that there was quite a number of people, however I cannot say definitely. Someone then gave me a paper which apparently was an examination (final) for a course in which I had no knowledge whatsoever. Then, upon thrashing the thing over in my mind, I remembered having signed up for the course at the beginning of the term. I never attended a class or the subject throughout the semester. At this point I was awakened."
"0224"	"I found myself driving my car. I was leaving the neighborhood where a girl with whom I used to have dates (five years ago) lives. As I was turning the corner, I cut too sharply and ran into an old lady who was waiting at the curb for a bus. I backed up hurriedly, turned around on the front lawn of the closest house knocking down several little fences bordering the walk, and drove away from the scene. I later found myself in the garage at my mother's home. I was examining the inner-tube from the car and found that it had about six pair of evenly spaced nails in its side and each was completely forced into the tube to the head. Later I remember looking at the motor and found it to be a mess covered with heavy oil and grease. I was later pouring water into the opening for oil. I discovered my mistake and stopped pouring. At this point the dream ended."
"0225"	"I was in a small classroom with some students from my chemistry section; however the class seemed to be in French. We were given forms to be filled out for a student who was majoring in psychology. They were obviously a part of an experiment or project. We were to fill out these forms with the first thing that came to our minds, and we were working against a few-minute time limit. I couldn't think of a thing to write. Even after everyone turned his form in I still had mine and tried to fill it out but with little success. The words that I did put down didn't seem to form sentences and they were all simple words like cat, it, etc. The professor seemed to be one of the male faculty of the WRU romance languages department who I had met once but who had never been one of my professors. One girl of the class was very outstanding in my mind. The rest of the class I couldn't recognize, but I assumed they were in my chemistry section due to the presence of the girl. That girl wore large shining glasses."
"0226"	"In the first part of the dream I was in a men's clothing store in my hometown looking for a rain coat. The only rain coat the salesman was able to show me was one made of woven straw and with isinglass panels on the upper part of the sleeves. I didn't buy the coat because both of the panels were cracked and I could image that the coat wouldn't last long. However, the price tempted me since it was only $5.30. The salesman began to tell me about his boss who was very disagreeable, tight and whenever he spoke the whole store smelled like sauerkraut. His boss broke up our conversation and I left the store. After I left I met most of the members of the Reserve football team. We walked down the street together until we came to an intersection. On the opposite corner was Harry Truman and in the adjacent corner was a friendly policeman. The football players couldn't catch the ball. I could. President Truman reported the friendly policeman to the chief of police for not staying on duty. We were all very disgusted."
"0227"	"The dream occurred just before waking this morning and was one of a series of short dreams. This was the most complete and best-remembered however. I am at home and it is 1:30, which is the time the mail is delivered. I ran down to the mailbox and a letter from the Reserve medical school. I close my eyes, say a few magic words and proceed to open it. It isn't an acceptance, however, but a letter saying that because I've had so many doctors write recommendations for me the money ($5) I paid originally for applying didn't cover the cost of handling all the letters I had had sent. Consequently my chances of getting into medical school were much smaller than previously. The next day I saw the dean of the school, and he further elaborated what I had seen in the letter. He seemed very disgusted with me and my methods. He also said that they had little respect for fellows who tried to swamp with ""too good"" letters of recommendations. Here, thank god, I awoke."
"0228"	"I, the dreamer, approached Mr. Harry Schenk, an instructor in the physics dept. to ask him to fill out another recommendation for medical school for me. However, he reached out his hand as if to contratulate me at the same time he reached into his vest pocket, which I have never known him to wear in reality. He pulled out a letter with my name on it. When I read it I found that an international physics and chemistry society had awarded me a scholarship for the coming year if I would in spare time aid by teaching lab work in the physics and chemistry depts. Naturally, I was very astonished but quite eager about the whole affair and accepted it at once. For the rest of the day I received congratulations from all of the science teachers that I have ever had or have known indirectly. The day was wonderful and I realized that this all would aid me tremendously in getting into medical school."
"0229"	"Again, this is a dream occurring just before waking in the morning as it was probably quite flexted to my will. I am in the American army and we are again at war with Germany. I am captured and imprisoned somewhere in Germany. I escape and most of the dream consists of my eluding the Germans, trying to use my one year of German effectively. Among the escapades, I resort to wounding my face with a piece of glass so as to disfigure my face making me unrecognizable. I come back to America in the uniform of a German soldier who I killed to get his clothes and paper (America is conquered). Here I act as the soldier and am able to reside at home where I try to help my family and aid the underground."
"0230"	"All the students of Cleveland (high school and college) were to have a peace meeting in a stadium outside Cleveland. The procession was led by Dr. Millis and all the major theological leaders of town. We all wore white robes and marched down Euclid Ave. in a formation resembling a large cross. We met at Adelbert Rd. and Euclid at 4 in the morning and were to arrive at he stadium about 12 noon. We had a good time on the way telling jokes and kidding. When we reached the stadium, it was bounded by three churches, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant. We ate the lunches that we had packed and then we listened to very interesting speeches by prominent theologians and the presidents of the colleges. Afterwards we came back in trucks and slept the rest of the afternoon. Of the speeches the best was given by a young intelligent looking priest. (I am protestant.)"
"0231"	"I was working at the SS Kresge Co. Dr. Shenk (physics teacher) was also working there. He told me to go and count the amount of Christmas candy. I did this for about two hours. it was then time to go home. I left the store and discovered I lost or forgot my wallet. I rushed back into the store. The place was full of policemen who were having a party. I found my wallet. Then I awoke."
"0232"	"I went to my dentist's office to get my teeth checked. He looked into my mouth and drew a picture of what my teeth looked like. I looked at the picture. The teeth had brown patches on the tops of them. That is, looking down at the crown of the teeth, they were brown on top. One molar had a large cavity in it. I asked him the price of fixing the teeth and how many needed fixing. He said 12 were in need of fixing and had to be pulled out. It would cost $160. I then told my mother. The alarm rang for me to get up."
"0233"	"I was in the jungle waters in Africa pushing a small boat. I was then surrounded by crocodiles. They began snapping at me and then I started to stab them. I got to shore safely. I then met a man who began cutting me with a bolo knife. I started cutting him. He was cut up badly but for a long time he wouldn't die. I finally succeeded, despite all my deep cuts, to kill him. I did not see any blood on any of us. I then woke up."
"0234"	"I was in the kitchen reading the newspaper and suddenly I turned and saw a hideous-looking person standing behind me. I then ran out the back door and to the front of the house. I turned again and saw the monster coming closer to me and I tried to run but I was unable to move. My legs would not budge. The monster was coming closer and I became frustrated and afraid because I could not move. The monster was about to grab me when I made myself wake up."
"0235"	"I was in the personality and adjustment psychology class and Dr. Hall was discussing the term papers. He then read one to the class. It was a bit humorous and illogical. Just as he finished reading I told Dr. Hall that my paper was much better and only got a C on it and then I asked him what grade the writer of the paper he read received. He told me A+. I became angry at his getting an A+ and me only a C."
"0236"	"The dream takes place in a very large home, almost a mansion. I walk from the hall into a den with a large desk in it. With me is a very beautiful blond who seems to be quite attached but not married. She seems to be about 24 years old. I don't recognize her but she calls me Dutch. When I sit behind the desk, people who look familiar, but I don't recognize, come into the room and plead with me not to stay with her but she tells me not to listen to them since I'm a big man who can make his own decisions. Since she gives me a lot of confidence in myself I stay."
"0237"	"The dream took place on the first landing of the stairs in the house we last lived in. It seemed that it was about 11 o'clock at night and pitch black. I was standing alone but I felt someone walking up the stairs behind me. Hard as I tried, I couldn't yell out or move as the person came closer. He came closer and closer but in the darkness I couldn't see who it was. As he reached for me I woke up shaking and in a cold sweat."
"0238"	"The dream took place in the recitation room of the biology building. My comparative anatomy teacher was standing in the front of the room and it seemed that I was the only one in the room listening to the lecture. As I was sitting here I was debating whether I ought to congratulate him for being chosen to speak before the scientist meeting that night. Then it seems that as I left after the lecture I was chastising myself for even thinking about it since it seemed to be merely a means of softening up the instructor to give me a higher grade."
"0239"	"The dream started off in the living room of a large mansion with four people whom I did not recognize standing looking at a package they had received in the mail. The package contained a music box inside of which was a calling card of a local undertaker. Suddenly we were aware that someone had been killed in the next room although we didn't see the body. A detective was called in to start the investigation in a typical Sherlock Holmes style. Everyone there was questioned including the undertaker who turns out to be a close friend of the family. After much thought the detective accuses the undertaker who in turn breaks down and confesses that business was so bad that he killed the person and then sent the music box as advertisement so the family would give him the business. The people in the room seemed to be my family but did not actually resemble my family in any way. The parents were about 40 years old and the daughter and son about 22. Even there was a feeling of some relationship. I still felt most of the time that I was merely a spectator."
"0240"	"The beginning of the dream is rather indefinite, but it seems that out of the haze I had the impression that a fellow by the name of Dave Kats, 19-year-old and a sophomore at Ohio State, had spent the weekend at our fraternity house here on campus. Yet the frat house looked like one that is pieture in the movies. In reality and in the dream Dave Katz was dating a girl who I was very serious about. Dave was leaving the house, thanking me for the weekend and driving away still not knowing who I am and my relationship to the girl. [Note: the strange part about it was that in the dream his build, hair, large nose, etc., were quite distinct and accurate despite the fact that I have never met this fellow, seen his picture, or heard anything about him other than his name.]"
"0241"	"I was with two other friends both male and we were all coming out of Gruber's Bar when I saw a red Jaguar parked by the road. I informed my friends that I could start it so why didn't we take it. So we did but not with malice, but more as a thrill. I then became aware of the fact that there was only room for four to sit in the car. (A real Jaguar only has room for two but this had a rumble seat.) This then meant to me that if we picked up some girls there would not be enough romo in the car. The next thing I recall is that there were only two of us in the car, the driver and myself."
"0242"	"I was washing in a bathroom at what in the dream was the Waldorf but couldn't have really been because it was much too shoddy. There was another boy in the bathroom who was also washing. (This bathroom went with our room.) Suddenly a woman materialized in the bathroom beside me. I dropped the soap in the washbowl and splashed her slightly. I apologized for my carelessness. As I was leaving I noticed that all she had on was a thin nightgown. I diverted my gaze from her because I was embarrassed at her dress and also because I had splashed her. I got into what had been my bedroom. It was filled with beds in which were young boys about 10 or 11 altogether. The dream ended."
"0243"	"I was back in Mexico at what I believe was the ranch I was visiting this summer. The people I stayed with would take no notice of me and I felt very small. I think that I then tried to get solace from the Mexicans in the bunk house but they would sort of wander away from me when I approached them. I went to the corral to take (steal) a horse, but I was apprehended by someone and woke up."
"0244"	"I was riding out a road in Bob's car. The road ran beside a lake and I noticed that many large turtles were immigrating from the lake to the fields on the other side of the road. There seemed to be two different types of turtles, land and sea. I asked Bob to stop the car so I could catch some of them to take home. They were very large, about a foot and a half in diameter. I caught two and put them in the trunk of the car. Then I went after some more, but when I came back to the car the two I had put in the car were dead and I was very disappointed because they seemed to be so completely dead."
"0245"	"I was driving my father's car and there was an unidentifiable boy with me. We were trying to go to the Shaker Club. Although we knew where it was, I was continually being thwarted by turning down streets that I was familiar with and having them come out in places where they shouldn't or being very long and seemingly without end. We reached the club but it was completely dark and then there were no cars around and I woke up."
"0246"	"I dreamt I was a pilot on an aircraft carrier and was assigned to fly a new experimental jet plane. I took off and flew the plane, but when I started to land the plane my speed was too great, and I overshot the deck. The plane crashed into the sea. As the plane was about to crash, I was transposed to the deck of the carrier. The body was compressed into a jet tube. However I didn't recognize the body as my own. I was then told that as a result of my death as the pilot for some reason or other I was told that I'd have to become senior medical officer on the ship."
"0247"	"There was a reunion at my high school just before finals. It was announced that alumni would be allowed to take the high school finals as practice for their own finals. This was explained to me and a friend of mine by two female students who were in my high school graduating class. We were standing by the men's room near my home room. I entered it and suddenly discovered that the plumbing started flooding. The dream then shifted and I saw water flooding out of Mather administration building. I then seemed to have a blank period and shifted to another unrelated dream. I may have awoken at this point. I'm not sure."
"0248"	"I was at a meeting at the B'nai B'rtih Hillel Foundation. I was alone in a room with a member of the committee which I head. Apparently there was the first time I pictured her in a sexual role. I tried to get a date with her for the coming Friday night because I would be unable to see my girl then. She said she had a date already, but I felt that she'd break it if I talked a little more about it. I then awoke."
"0249"	"I had been arraigned for a murder of which I was innocent. A former friend of the family could prove this as well as provide a lawyer for me. He refused to do so either because of a dislike for me because I had turned out better than his own son or because of a previous argument which he had had with my father. He claimed that he couldn't help me because I had had an intimate sexual relationship with my girl. At first I wasn't sure whether I had done this or not. Later I realized I had, but it seemed very conclusive and important that she was not pregnant as a result of it. I was then awaiting the actual trial and again pleaded with him for help. He refused me again."
"0250"	"I was in a mountain pass in the warlines in the 1860's. Down at the foot of the mountain was a small mining town. Some other members of the fraternity to which I belong joined me. They had been attacked and driven out of the town by members of another fraternity. I said that we should retake the town by force if necessary. I urge it even though they are better armed than we are since we outnumber them. I was abruptly awakened by my alarm clock."
"0251"	"I was in a classroom taking an exam. Everything went smoothly until I hit the last question which involved the use of some mathematics since the problem was one of the applications of pressure to a gas and its consequent compression. I worked on the problem for what was a long time in the dream and was not able to finish it in time. As I read this created a great deal of anxiety."
"0252"	"The scene I can recall is cast in the kitchen of our fraternity house. It was an ordinary college bull session revolving around an icebox raid. The only topic of conversation I can recall was a discussion of the various assets of a fraternity brother's girl. After that I left the kitchen and somehow got on a stairway that was pretty steep. I think I was going down the stairway and yet at other times I was going up. On the stairway, there was somebody else, I think it was a female but I can't recall who it was. I rather think it was an unidentified being."
"0253"	"I was in a movie house watching a film. Somehow or other I became a participant in the movie itself. In the one scene of the movie I recall, I was standing behind a man who was exchanging shots with another man who kept ducking behind a ledge. All of a sudden, the man behind the ledge made an appearance. The man to whom I was apparently allied fired his weapon upon my yelling now. Then I returned to the audience and was no longer an actor in the film. As I left the theater I met some female acquaintances. I remember debating in the dream whether or not I should greet these people or try to avoid them."
"0254"	"The first thing I recall in the dream is a group of people standing around the door leading into an apartment. The cause of the excitement was a jammed lock. There appeared to be a number of dollar bills jammed in the lock that prevented its proper functioning. I managed to extricate the bills and get the lock working again. The next thing I recall was a living room full of relatives discussing something, but I don't know what they were discussing now. The scene then shifted to a kitchen. Here I remember having had a discussion with a cousin, who lives here in Cleveland and not in my hometown where the other relatives in the dream live. My discussion with my cousin consisted of a series of commentaries by him of people he knew but whom I did not know."
"0255"	"The scene took place in a station. My mother was leaving with another acquaintance of mine on the train. I remember my mother remarking that the acquaintance was going to have a baby. As I heard the remark it caused me a great deal of anxiety since I felt the remark was a little too tactless. The dream ended before anyone got on the train and therefore consisted only of conversation on the station platform. I remember bits of the conversation such as my mother's saying, how much she was looking forward to getting where she was going."
"0256"	"I was driving along in my car, when someone hit me. I got out of the car, but I wasn't angry. In fact, I felt glad it happened because now I could get my car repaired. A friend of mine who was riding with me began to repair the seat covers, but I told him not to bother. I explained that the insurance company would pay for everything."
"0257"	"I was performing an experiment. The experiment was very difficult and I did not entirely understand it. Finally after much practice I knew what I was doing. I pulled a string that was attached to a bird's beak. I was afraid I was going to hurt the bird and at first I did not want to perform the experiment. I saw that I was getting behind in my work so I finally tried the experiment. To my amazement, everything worked out all right."
"0258"	"Another boy and myself were roommates. We had the room in a very neat condition. One day we were going on a picnic with my parents and some friends. We decided to take the portable television set along. When we came back from the picnic, we had a hard time getting the television set up the stairs. When my roommate and I entered the bedroom we found two other couples there. They had the room all messed up. The two girls were lying in bed. We told them we would try to repair the television set so that they could see a good picture. In the meantime, the people with whom we had gone to the picnic were waiting in the car. Finally my father got very angry and came upstairs and started throwing things around. After we explained our trouble with the TV set, he sort of quieted down and we all went out to the car."
"0259"	"I had just received my acceptance from a medical school. I sent in a one hundred dollar deposit and then began packing my clothes. Then I went downtown to board a train. The train ride seemed very long and one time I thought we were going in circles. The train seemed to speed up then it would almost come to a stop. I enjoyed the ride very much. When I arrived at the medical school, there was a crowd of people waiting to greet me. I felt very happy."
"0260"	"This dream took place in a school building. I had many problems on my mind. I was trying to decide what subjects to take in my senior year. A geography teacher became very friendly with me so I decided it would be a good idea to take geography. As I was walking through the hall I heard some people talking about a dance that was coming up. I was worried because I did not have a date. This dance was to be held on New Year's Eve. Then I decided that I might take out the geography teacher. She was a very beautiful woman and relatively young."
"0261"	"I was swimming in a pool that I had frequented this summer. There were a great many girls swimming too and when I looked at them I noticed they didn't have any bathing suits on. I went underneath the water and one of the girls followed me and there was a bed on the bottom of the pool. After I had satisfied myself with one girl another came down to the bottom of the pool. This went on for a long time until I could no longer stay underneath the water. I started to dry myself after leaving the water and all the girls gathered around and blew hot air on me until I was dry. It was a wonderful sensation and I lay down on the grass and all the girls surrounded me and started to sing softly in my ears while they stroked my body with soft, gentle hands."
"0262"	"I was driving a car through a hilly countryside and there were two small children sitting in the back seat and looking at the scenery and laughing. I stopped the car and we all got out and I picked up a small rifle and went looking for some animals. A big tiger came charging through the brush and tried to attack the children. I picked up my rifle and shot it through the head. The children looked at me with admiration and I felt happy. It was a bright sunny day and through the trees I saw two deer drinking from a pond. I shot both deer and loaded them on the car and then the children got out and I gave them each a deer. As I drove off the children threw kisses and I was happy and excited."
"0263"	"I was walking across the street and a car hit me although I felt no pain. I was lying in the street and my legs wouldn't move. An older woman came over to me and tried to help me up. I became very frightened and didn't want her to touch me. I tried to struggle against her picking me up but I only fell down again. Another woman and then a whole flock of people came over and tried to help me. They lifted me up and started to carry me like they do a baseball player after knocking down the game winning run. I started to feel better but then I broke away from them and started to run. Nobody seemed to chase me and I slowed down to a walk but then I didn't know where I was walking to and I became afraid and it was dark all around me so I couldn't see."
"0264"	"I was in a long magnificent looking convertible and driving past a row of mansions. I had on a tuxedo and looked very dapper. I stopped the car in front of the nicest looking house of all and rang the bell not quite knowing what to expect. The most gorgeous girl in the world answered the bell and threw herself in my arms. She was ravishingly beautiful. We got into the car and drove till we reached a large hotel and then we were dancing in a large ballroom. I felt as though we were dancing on clouds and all the people in the room looked at us with jealousy. Then the people disappeared and we were alone in my bedroom. We were both undressed and looked quite older. We were married and spending our first night together. I was extremely happy and the girl said she was happy too."
"0265"	"I was walking along a deserted street in a small town. It was about seven in the evening and starting to get dark and I thought people were staring at me from behind closed windows and doors. There was an unnatural quiet in the air and the only sound I could hear were my shoes scraping the cement. All of a sudden a shuttered window opened and a gorgeous girl, unclothed, beckoned to me. I wanted to run into the house where she was staying, but something was preventing me. My feet just couldn't move because all the people were shouting and calling me names. They told me not to go. The girl was pretty and I wanted to go with her very badly but my feet could not move."
"0266"	"I dreamt that I was in Florida. I was walking along when I came to a small road that led to a little lake. The lake was sheltered from sight of the road by dense foliage and palm trees. I was surprised to see that I had come to my uncle's home near Tampa. I was even more surprised to see that my cousin Lynn was there even though she had been married about three months before and was in New York. My cousin Lynn is about 25. My uncle is about 60 and his wife the same age."
"0267"	"I dreamed that I was walking along when all of a sudden I saw Joan. I have been dating Joan regularly for over a year. She is 19. I started to run to her and when I had run halfway I stopped to see how much further I would have to run. Joan was still halfway away. I kept on running but she was always the same halfway away. I thought to myself that I had been trapped in Xeno's paradox. I continued to run but I could never get any closer."
"0268"	"I dreamt that I fired Norm for not doing his job on the yearbook. Norm came into the office after an absence of about three or four weeks. I told him that I was sick and tired of his screwing up on the yearbook and that he could pack up and get out. He asked me what I was talking about and I told him that he knew damned well. I was getting very angry. Finally I told him to get the ell out of the office. Norm worked (supposedly) on the staff on the yearbook. He is about 18."
"0269"	"I had taken a friend of mine to see the secret passageway in the house. We went up the stairs. I led the way. When we came to the top of the stairs, I turned to the ledge which led to the secret passage down through the house to the basement. On the ledge there were two silver blue foxes sitting in front of the entrance to the passage. They would not let us enter the passage, so we went downstairs. The friend was a cadet officer in ROTC and was in uniform. I do not know who he was as his face was indistinct."
"0270"	"I went looking for the negatives that Dick had lost. [See dream report of April 9.] I started out in temporary building and proceeded down a very strange theatrical setting style Reserve Campus. I was looking on the ground for negatives. I walked towards 105th Street, but found myself on 9th Street. I thought that someone was following me. I stopped and looked into a store window. There were I noticed two theatres on opposite sides of the street. I felt someone following me. I crossed Superior and went into a leather goods and optical shop where I escaped pursuit by leaving by a side door."
"0271"	"My twelve-year-old sister and I were walking down Silsby Road in University Heights. It was a summer evening; a negro was following us. We became frightened and ran to a house and asked to be taken in. A young boy about 12 was the only person at home, but he let us in. As soon as we got inside, the negro came to the door and attempted to come in. The door was locked, however, and he remained outside. It grew very dark and I looked out the window and saw the negro glaring at me. I thumbed my nose at him and he ran after another small boy who was passing by, caught him and put him into the trunk of a blue 1947 Chrysler. I called the police, but when I looked back to the street the negro had driven away. At this point I awoke."
"0272"	"I found myself in the Adelbert Gym practicing golf. I was hitting golf ball after golf ball against the canvas curtains which divide the gym into sections. My girlfriend came into the gym. Though I was surprised to see her (for this was the boys' gym) I asked if she would like some instruction in golf. She replied that she would like to learn the game. I gave her a golf club and showed her how to swing. After she had hit nine or ten balls she said that I had better start practicing myself if I wanted to make the golf team. When I began again a boy came over to me and asked me to hit a lead golf ball. I replied that I would not for it might break the club. Then Eddie came over to me and told me to leave for the baseball players had to practice. I was very disappointed but nevertheless I picked up my clubs and left. I then awoke feeling very sad."
"0273"	"I had just finished my lunch at home and was riding a red bicycle back to Shaker Heights High School. As I rode along Lee Road, I noticed how dark the sky was becoming. Large gray clouds completely obscured the sun that had been shining a few minutes before. I knew I must hurry for it would rain very soon. Upon reaching the school I parked my bike and hurried to my English class. The entire class was present and only my chair in the front row was vacant. As I entered the classroom I had a strange feeling that I had been absent from this class for a great length of time. Yet no one seemed to be surprised at my arrival. In fact no one in the entire room said a word to me. The class consisted of both my high school and college friends, but I was puzzled and disappointed that my girlfriend was not present."
"0274"	"I had been standing in my bedroom all day watching the peculiar actions of a blimp. It would fly back and forth over the house and disappear for a few minutes. It remained rather high in the air until the afternoon. Then gray clouds began to form in the horizon and the blimp came lower and lower. I put on my pea jacket and reached the backyard just in time to see the silvery blimp land in a field that adjoins our home. I was absolutely amazed. Why should a blimp land here? A small door in the gondola opened and two crew members climbed out. They wore navy uniforms. Suddenly I noticed one of my fraternity brothers (who is a clown and not a very good student) running over to the man who appeared to be in charge. My fraternity brother assured him that it was permissible to moor the blimp in the field for as long as he desired. The captain of the blimp said he must leave soon. My fraternity brother was disappointed for he wanted to use the blimp for an air force demonstration at school."
"0275"	"I found myself attending college in Japan during the second World War. Actually it was Western Reserve University and the setting and surroundings were the same as they are in Cleveland today. My parents had informed me that at a certain hour and a certain day, the university was to be bombed by American planes. I was told to take all possible precautions and to leave the university at once secretly. Furthermore I was to tell a certain girl about this future bombing. I managed to find the girl and informed her and her parents of the air raid. Then eating in the cafeteria a fraternity brother of mine took the last bottle of milk from the counter. He would not share it with me so I vowed not to tell him of the forthcoming raid. In the cafeteria I saw another girl (whom I have just recently met) and I felt that I should warn her also. She put her tray down next to mine but then before I could say anything she had vanished."
"0276"	"I and a young lady of my age, along with another couple who are our age, seemed to be skiing. My date and I tested a long ski run. It seemed to be a long wooden sliding board though. We didn't have skis either. The ride down the board consisted of a slide, then one ski jump, then some more sliding, and finally before the bottom was reached there was a place which caused the slider to think that he was about to do another ski jump but instead, just as he reached the end of the take off platform he would suddenly feel that he was going to fall a huge distance and possibly get hurt or even killed. However, as he continued to go over the end he would actually safely continue a slide to the bottom of the run. All of this procedure was in a sitting position. My date and I tried out the ski run a few times and then proceeded to enjoy watching the anxiety created in the other couple by the trick spot in the run as they attempted it their first time. All four of us laughed then and then proceeded to enjoy having our stomachs come up into our mouths each time we slid down the exciting run."
"0277"	"I was sleeping and someone came into my room causing me to come into a semi-awake state. There were two people and one of them seemed to be a friend of mine (who actually lives across the hall from me in my dormitory). I couldn't figure out who the other person was, although he seemed to be an apprentice in the act which the former was performing. He was attempting to play some sort of practical joke. I could hear him opening my dresser drawers. I began to get slightly angry and tried to wake myself up completely. I strained hard, trying to wake myself up. At this point, I really woke up and found that my roommate had just gotten up to go to class. He was opening one of the drawers on his own dresser."
"0278"	"I was with a prostitute who was about 25 or 30 years old. She was nude. I disrobed and displayed my body to her. She said that she didn't think I would be able to satisfy her. However, I was sure that I could do so, so I talked her into letting me try. We proceeded to have intercourse, even though she was still rather skeptical at first. I satisfied her and the dream ended with my having an orgasm."
"0279"	"I was having intercourse with my mother. She was reluctant and didn't want me to do it, but I told her that I was trying to learn something which might prove valuable to me. I was sort of curious too, as intercourse with my mother was something new and unusual. She consented although she did not become sexually aroused at all. I felt guilty and a bit disgusted during the act. We tried some postural positions which I knew that most women object to, but which I wanted to find out about. The experience was not very pleasurable in general, although I almost had an orgasm immediately before I woke up. Incidentally, no thought of my father occurred to me in this dream although earlier this same night I had a dream in which my father appeared. The dream seemed to be pleasant, but I can't remember what it was about."
"0280"	"I was fully clad in a black cowboy suit. I was practicing paddling a canoe on some rapids. It seemed that a certain angle which I turned the canoe allowed it to drift upstream against the swift current, with no paddling required. A large snake was constructively criticizing my efforts which seemed rather successful. I watched the snake swim around a bit with its head raised out of the water. It seemed to wait on the shore downstream, behind me then as I made each trial with the canoe. I seemed to be a bit afraid of the snake, although I respected and heeded its advice. It seemed to be friendly, but I was still slightly afraid of it since it was a rather large snake. I woke up after several successful runs up the short rapids."
"0281"	"The dream at first occurred in the north country. It was cold and bleak. Great mounds of snow were stretching before me. I looked in the direction of my Ford auto and was startled and frightened at the pack of burly vicious wolves which were running towards it. I ran towards the car with a great burst of speed, opened the door and went in. I felt greatly relieved, however, when I looked in the back seat. My recently married long time friend was necking with his wife which made me feel left out. I stepped on the gas and started, then I spotted a big dog come lumbering towards the car. I tromped down on the accelerator and got out of there. The following transition was amazing. I found myself driving down a long white-paved highway which was abounding on each side with lush green vegetation, and to the right of me was a lake which was teeming with wild ducks. The sight was wonderful after the first experience I had been through."
"0282"	"There was a carnival out in the country. I was standing by a shooting gallery which was managed by two men. They asked me to try my luck. I smilingly replied, ""Oh no, not me."" They coaxed me jokingly, but I refused. they then jumped down from the gallery and chased me. I turned around quickly and grabbed each by his thumb exerting pressure on the digit. I led the two men around like bulls by the nose until I saw a policeman to whom I gave custody of the men. I jokingly retorted, ""You boys won't be in jail long. Probably for the night -- anyways the rest will do you good."" Ironically I said, ""They have nice soft beds there. See you again next year boys, when the carnival comes this way?"" ""Oh no you won't,"" they replied."
"0283"	"I looked into a tavern and saw a neighborhood girl whom I like. I ran across the street to my car, and before entering it, I looked around to be sure she was watching. I jumped into the car and stomped on the accelerator and went roaring down the street. I said to a friend who was walking down the street, ""I must be doing a hundred."" He laughed and said, ""Oh, you're only doing fifty."" I looked at the speedometer and was surprised and rather shocked to see that he was right. I then pulled into my driveway and went into the house."
"0284"	"I dreamed I was on a beach with a girl whom I didn't know. We were clad in swimming togs. I then remember her mounting me and began intercourse. I, however, didn't like her taking the initiative so I rolled her over and proceeded with the love-making in the usual manner. I didn't have an orgasm however."
"0285"	"I jumped into my car and decided to go target practicing in the country. I remember riding along and enjoying the beautiful scenery immensely. However, it then dawned on me that I had nothing to shoot at, so I decided to stop and find something. I stopped at a farm house and went into a barn looking for something to shoot at. I spotted it. Ah, a barrel with a bung-hole, (I couldn't be that hard up) and began to carry it out of the barn. Suddenly the farm woman saw me and told me to put down the barrel. The firmness of the tones of her voice hastened my putting down of the barrel. I made out as if I wanted to buy something, and I gave as an excuse that I wanted to put the articles I bought into the barrel. I then went out of the barn and did buy some tomato plants with ripe tomatoes on them. I then got into my car and remember myself driving home."
"0286"	"I was sitting on a couch with a friend's girl. My friend and my date were hidden from us by the back of the couch. The girl was 19. The other fellow was also 19 and my date was 23. My friend's girl and I were passionately necking while hidden from the other two people. I was about to have sexual intercourse with the girl when the other two people came into view and the dream ended as we were separating."
"0287"	"It was a wintry night and the highways were slightly slippery. I had a girl with me who was about 21 or 22 years of age. I did not know who she was. I drove up a hill until we reached the top. At the top of the hill I turned the car around and started back down the hill. About halfway down the hill I lost control of the car and it went into a skid. At the bottom of the hill several cars were parked beside the road. I was thrown out of the car and the car landed on top of the parked cars completely demolished. The girl was unhurt and the dream then came to an end."
"0288"	"This took place in the South Pacific aboard a destroyer. Somehow my mother was also aboard this ship. I was about to be transferred to an aircraft carrier. I gathered my gear together and climbed up the ladder of the aircraft carrier. Another sailor showed me to my locker. I spent quite a bit of time getting the locker open. Finally I stowed all my gear and went back on deck to return to the destroyer and say goodbye to my mother. Upon returning topside I saw that the destroyer had cast off and was moving past the carrier and I wasn't going to get to say goodbye. The dream then ended."
"0289"	"I was in a strange town. I had just heard about Chet Miller's being killed. Chet Miller had been killed two days previously in time trials at the Indianapolis Speedway. I was driving my car up a sidestreet in town looking for the remains of his car. I saw it but it was not badly damaged. Upon arriving at the hospital I entered the operating room. They had already wrapped up Miller's body in rubber sheets and heavy rope. A girl that I am going with was an attending nurse but she didn't seem to recognize me. She is 23. Chet Miller was 50 years old."
"0290"	"I was sitting in someone's home in the living room. Nothing was familiar. There were about eight men and women there, none of whom I recognized with the exception of a girl I know about 23 years of age. We were all sitting watching home movies when suddenly this girl pulled out a pistol and shot one of the middle-aged people in the center of the forehead. Everyone was surprised but they did not know who had committed the crime. The dream then ended."
"0291"	"After coming into work at Basch Jewelers, I went downstairs to leave my coat and books. On the way up the steps to the office I passed a girl who was going down. Just after the girl passed, I realized it was Millie, a high school girl who worked part time. I was quite surprised because she had been out sick for the past two weeks. After greeting her, surprisedly I noticed she looked rather pale from her illness."
"0292"	"One evening I went down to my friend's house to pay him a visit. When I came in, Richard's mother told me I would find him resting in his bedroom. I walked into his bedroom and was quite surprised to find his younger cousin there and Richard in his pajamas. (He always lies down in his street clothes when he takes a rest, and he never wears pajamas.) When I came in he jumped up grinning and we started to wrestle around the room."
"0293"	"While walking to class I met a close friend with whom I often go out on double dates. Upon meeting Phil, my friend, he told me that he had to make a stop for about 15 minutes during our date that Saturday. He wanted to know if it was alright with me, because I was driving that Saturday. I was very confused because I thought Phil had previously told me that he couldn't go with us that Saturday, so I made arrangements to go with another couple."
"0294"	"I was walking along the street with a friend when we came to a movie house which had been made over and was now used for church meetings. On the marquee was an announcement that Ted Williams had died. I felt very bad after reading this and considered his death a great loss to the sports world. Then I began to wonder why he died, for death resulting from complications arising from a simple arm wound seemed very strange. Then I woke."
"0295"	"I was sitting at my desk waiting for class to begin when a girl I had been dating quite frequently entered the room. I was rather surprised to see her for she had been vacationing in Florida the past week. As she passed behind me to get to her seat one of her girlfriends asked her where she got the fraternity pin which was quite prominent on her blouse. She replied that she was pinned to Dinny Bernaway while in Florida. I was quite hurt to hear this for she had turned me down when I had asked her to go steady a few months earlier."
"0296"	"I was climbing a steep hill or mountain. My wife was slightly ahead of me. Suddenly she stopped in her tracks and when I caught up with her, she was extremely nervous and afraid but for no apparent reason. She was unable to continue the climb so we started down. Thereupon I myself became fearful, again for no apparent reason."
"0297"	"I was crossing a city street late at night. It was deserted and the night very black. I got about halfway across when I became aware that a terrific wind was blowing directly head on. Two headlights glared out of the darkness, but because of the wind I could make no headway. I cried out and awoke after which I discovered that my forearms were shaking from the exertion, apparently of having tried to swim through the opposing gale."
"0298"	"I was walking down a strange (unknown) street with a companion (also unknown; even the sex is vague). Amongst all the strange houses I spied one that seemed perfectly familiar and started to enter. Then for some reason I began to be afraid and hung back. My companion scoffed at me and prodded me on, but I refused to enter. Then a blank followed and a short time later I was in a perfectly familiar room but could not place it. This made me angry so I tried to leave. However, I couldn't get out. Upon awakening, the room still seemed familiar, but still I could not specifically identify or place it."
"0299"	"I was walking in what may best be described as an empty subway tunnel although I am not familiar with such things. There were no tracks but evidence that people had been there was seen by the fact that the circular walls (of rock) had scribbling etched on them somewhat as the interior of a phone booth. The farther end was a great ways off, but I could see light in the distance. Also I could hear music. As I continued walking the sound of cascading water drowned out the music. I found that the tunnel opened into a marshland which was strewn with large rocks or boulders. I climbed upon one of the boulders, whereupon I noticed that there were several lead soldiers strewn over it. I tried to line them up in military fashion but the constant slapping of the water over the edge of the rock knocked them over. I put them in my pocket (shirt) and started for a house (which appeared unaccountably) but I seemed top heavy and stumbled and fell into the water. I seemed to spend several hours emptying my pockets of lead soldiers of which there seemed to be an inexhaustible supply."
"0300"	"I went to a large movie theater with my wife. She went ahead of me down the aisle. It was so dark that I lost sight of her. I saw a figure entering one of the rows of seats and thinking it was she I followed her. Upon reaching the seats I discovered that my wife was in reality sitting in the row behind me. The girl I followed to the seat turned out to be a former schoolmate of whom I have neither heard nor thought of for at least five years. We both thought the situation very funny and laughed and laughed."
"0301"	"I was living in a log cabin in the north woods with two boyfriends of mine. We were up there deer hunting. One afternoon while we were cleaning a deer that one of my friends had shot in the morning we smelled smoke and looked up the moutainside to see a small forest fire starting. The cabin had Indian pump guns in it for fires that might start around camp. So Don and I took the two guns and got our horses and started for the fire while Chuck rode for help to the Forest Rangers. When we reached the fire it was getting pretty well out of hand but we held it down so it would spread not too much further, and thought we had things pretty well under control. Then a strong wind got behind the fire and we had to get out and join the rangers who were coming to help us when they saw what happened. They started a back fire and soon the fire was out."
"0302"	"The dream started in a way that was odd. I was in a rocket flying to some body out in space. There was only one other person aboard: my brother who was my copilot. Something went wrong with a wiring system outside the ship so I had to go out in a spacesuit and fix it. While I was out there we came in contact with the gravitational pull of some planet and I fell off the hull of our ship. The last thing I remember was falling through space and going through different colored cloud layers that turn my skin the color of the cloud layer. I woke up just as I was about to hit a planet's surface."
"0303"	"I was driving my car along a dark road. All of a sudden a figure lurched out in front of me. I was unable to swerve from it and I struck it head on. I was awfully afraid and I stepped on the gas to get out of there. I kept going faster and faster. Then behind me two headlights kept getting closer so I went even faster. I was going about 85 when I started to skid but I got control of the car again and thought everything was alright when an edge of a cliff was right before me. Then my car's steering went wrong and I plunged off the cliff. My dream ended here."
"0304"	"We were walking down a path in a big forest when all of a sudden a huge bird, a hawk of some kind, came down and picked up my younger brother and carried him off to a nest. My other brother and I stood there spellbound. We ran back to our tent and got our .22 rifle which we had brought along just for target practice. We then ran to where the nest was and started to creep up on it when all of a sudden the bird took off with my younger brother. He started to fly low out over a body of water. I felt this would be the last time we would see him so I took my rifle and shot at the bird. It let go of my brother and he fell into the lake. He swam to the shore. The bird fell into the water dead. This is where my dream ended."
"0305"	"I was looking out the window of my bedroom. We had company downstairs and they were playing cards with my parents. I heard this motor roaring as it went by our house, and I had a funny feeling something was going to happen. It was daylight out and I could see real well what happened. This one car that was going fast started to pass another car but when he got halfway past, another car from the opposite direction plowed into it head on. It was a terrific crash with the people falling out of the cars and laying there. I ran downstairs and had my dad call the police. Then the people who were playing cards with my father and mother went to the scene of the accident to give first aid. I went too and my dream ended."
"0306"	"I was in a room of some kind and for some reason I had to get down to the street. The only trouble was that there were men all around with guns trying to stop me. There were three men with me and one was a Cuban. At first we started down with one going first and the Cuban right behind me. The only weapon I had was a little gun that looked like a ring and it didn't shoot straight. The first guy fired at me but I just kept on running. Then I ran into a guy with a machine gun right in front of me. I went right over him shooting at him with my gun. Somehow I got through and bullied my way through the last guy and reached the stairs. Then I was awakened."
"0307"	"I dreamed I was back in the Marine Corps and it seems I was dug in with some of the guys I was in with before. We were just getting ready to move out when I found out that I didn't have any ammunition left. The word was passed to move out and I was still looking for ammunition. As we were running along and approaching the enemy I was getting panicky and I finally as we were upon the enemy, the dream ended."
"0308"	"The dream takes place at some sort of dance hall which I had never seen before and I was dancing with a girl from my hometown who I had only seen once in my life before. I am dancing with her at one moment and the scene suddenly switches and I am being married to her. I seemed to be very happy in the dream but when I awoke I couldn't figure out why."
"0309"	"The dream starts in the basement of our fraternity house where most everyone in the house is gathered. I see that someone has discovered a wine cellar in one corner of the basement and there are bottles and bottles of champagne all over the room. Then the scene switches and I am arguing furiously with someone I didn't know who wanted to break all the bottles. The dream ended with hundreds of bottles all over the basement and everyone drinking and laughing."
"0310"	"I was rolling a ball up a long hill and another person with me told me to be careful and not let go of the ball. Just then an old Model A Ford came by with a lot of people. I recognized it as a car I used to own a long time ago. While I was watching these people the ball got away from me and rolled down the hill. I chased the ball to the bottom of the hill where it hit a rock and bounced up into the limbs of a tree. I began to climb up the tree when my alarm clock went off."
"0311"	"This dream has been recurrent at the rate of twice a week since 11-10-50. Dreamer in the dream is in the US Army in combat in Europe. Subject's company has been ordered to capture a specific hill. After securing the hill further orders demand that the company secure positions in the line of advance at the base of the hill. While charging down the hill with three buddies one of the buddies hollers, ""Hit the dirt."" Everyone starts to dig in except the subject who, for some reason which he can't explain, remains erect. A shell explodes and all are safe except the subject who is killed."
"0312"	"This dream is a reproduction of an accident which the subject was involved in a short time before. The dream is recurrent. In the dream the subject is driving along a narrow two lane highway on the outskirts of an Ohio town, about 70 miles west of Cleveland. The truck approaches around the curve coming toward the subject's car. The truck cab passes the car, but the trailer skids and the subject swerves to miss the trailer. Right rear wheel of subject's car catches on soft shoulder and flips car into concrete bridge abutment. Subject awakens when car crashes into bridge."
"0313"	"Dream is set in a seashore resort. Subject and subject's family are guests of a household at the resort. (The family of the household is unknown to subject.) The woman of the house is beautiful and desirable. She and subject meet on a side porch of the house. Subject takes physical liberties with willing hostess (fondling). Host passes and perceives action between subject and host's wife. Hostess remains calm; subject becomes terrified. Hostess remarks that she will have to get her other body and to meet her on the back porch. Hostess is still beautiful, but she has aged approximately 20 years. Subject proceeds to engage hostess in sexual intercourse. Due to the aging of the hostess the intercourse is unsatisfactory to subject, whereupon the subject replaces his pants and leaves. The subject now momentarily awakened and then resumed his night's sleep."
"0314"	"In this dream the dreamer was climbing a mountain which he had been told in actual life that the particular mountain couldn't be climbed. Dreamer is actually afraid of high places, yet in the dream he is climbing a perpendicular precipice and for the first time in the climb he becomes terrified. In the dream the subject knows there is a cave immediately above him so he climbs into the cave where he rests and regains courage. The dreamer resumes his climb then his fear returns and he returns to the cave. This episode of leaving and returning to the cave recurs several times in the dream until finally the subject resolves to climb to the top. In the course of the climb said subject slips, starts to fall through space and then awakens."
"0315"	"In this dream Christmas Cove, Maine, seashore et al. is apparently relocated in Nevada. The dreamer and several friends are building cstles in the beach sand. The ocean surf breaking on the beach hurls pebbles at the castles whereupon the dream subjects cast the stones back into the surf. Some force impels the people to cast the stones back into the surf. The subject's father arrives on the beach and requests subject to accompany him on a visit to hospitalized woman, a mutual friend. Subject's father uses helicopter as mode of travel. Visit to woman who has been hospitalized because of skiing accident is cut short because of previous hunting plans with father, who in real life never hunts. The last impression of dream is flying over heavily wooded timberland with (subject and father) in the helicopter. The entire dream was in color, but the most vivid color appeared when the timberland appeared in the dream."
"0316"	"I dreamed that one of my buddies who was in the army was wounded in action in Korea. When he came home he found out that I was engaged to the girl he used to go with. He had one arm shot off, one eye out and his right leg was cut off at the knee. He said that he had been cut down by a mortar shell. After finding out that I was going with his girl he killed himself. The whole town thought it was my fault because I was going with his girl. After this the girl and myself broke up. The next day I was drafted into the army and after my training I was sent to Korea where I got shot up in the same way as my buddy that got killed. This is where my dream ended."
"0317"	"I was dreaming that I was pitching for the Boston Red Sox. I had a no hit game going into the last inning when Bob Feller of Cleveland came up and got a hit off me. It was his first hit all season and he just stood on first base and laughed at me. He laughed so much that I finally went over to him and shot him with a gun I had in my back pocket. Then from out of the stands came all the people. They started after me and finally caught me on the top of the Terminal Tower. They kept coming at me until they had pushed me off the tower. I awake before I hit the street down below."
"0318"	"In this dream I was a basketball star for the professional team the New York Rams. The score was tied going into the last second. I threw the ball the length of the floor and it went in. We won the professional championship of the world. There wasn't anyone in the gym because they were televising the game and they were all home watching it in their homes. After the game the other players on my team came up to congratulate me and I notice that they didn't have any eyes. This was the end of the dream."
"0319"	"I dreamed that I had a gun and was at home. My mother and father were there also. We got in a big argument about something then I pulled out the gun and shot them both. I dreamed I ran out of the house and into the street. I ran and ran until I came to this empty house out in the country. I enter it. After being in the house for a while there appeared on the wall faces of both of my parents. I ran out of the house but the faces keep following me in the back of the house was a well. The faces came at me until they had backed me right up to the well then I fell in and awakened."
"0320"	"I dreamed that I was out with a girl I had never known before. It was a blind date that one of my buddies fixed up. After having a wonderful evening I stop along the road in the park to make some love. After a few kisses the girl and I had sexual relations and on the way home the girl said that she would see me soon. I couldn't se her because she was to leave that very night for South America with her family. The next day I was walking downtown when I crossed the street and this car came bearing down upon me just as the bumper was about to hit me I awoke."
"0321"	"I was on an island in this dream. There were two large buildings that looked like Navy barracks on it and there was a terrific wind blowing. In one of the barracks there were about a hundred men and in the other about a hundred women. I was going from one building to the other for some reason or another and my dream ended when the wind tore off my blue shirt that I was wearing and somehow it was sucked into a small hole in one of the barracks."
"0322"	"This dream took place near a creek beside a highway in Dover, Ohio. Frank, an old high school friend, and I were working with some construction outfit along this highway. My friend is 23 years old. There was a creek running alongside the highway, and the only thing I can remember is going over to this creek about every five minutes to get a drink of water. The first couple of times I used my hands to scoop up the water, but later I used an old rusty can that I found by the creek."
"0323"	"In this dream my wife and I were living in a house on top of a high hill. There was a steep winding stairway descending from our house to the bottom of the hill. I would say the height of the hill was about 300 feet. I was attending some college and my mother, brother, and two friends came to visit us. They stayed for a short time, and during that time I was trying to find a baseball game on the radio, but I couldn't. It seems to me that we got into an argument over something and they decided to leave. The last thing I can remember is helping my mother down the long steep, winding stairs. "
"0324"	"In this dream my wife and I were driving along a country road when I decided to turn the car around for some unknown reason. It so happened I ran the two front wheels into a ditch. When I backed the car across the road the two front wheels came off. After getting out of the car to have a look I discovered the car was practically demolished. My brother-in-law (30) came into the picture and I asked him how much he thought it would cost to get my car fixed. The last thing I can remember is my brother-in-law telling me to junk the car."
"0325"	"I was climbing up a very steep hill trying to get a hold of a tree when I lost my footing. The next thing I remember is holding onto a stone dangling from a very high cliff. I looked down to see how far it was. It was so far down that I couldn't see bottom. I knew I would fall eventually. It was just a matter of how long I could hang on to the stone. I became very frightened when my arms started to get weaker and weaker. I finally let loose of the stone and I fell through space. I had a dizzy feeling as I was falling. I was awakened just before hitting bottom."
"0326"	"There was a big blackboard on which a teacher in a queer costume was writing some math problems. The class was sitting on stiff boards with no backs and as soon as one person moved the teacher was there on top of the student hitting him with a scale (draftsmen). Then the students together revolted against the teacher and they turned the room upside down, but they never touched the teacher. Then the teacher stopped and with a low voice said please be quiet (I think) and everything was the same again with the room back in order."
"0327"	"I dreamt that I was walking down a street and someone stopped me and asked if I could do any kind of physical activity and I kind of made a motion as saying yes. Then I found myself in a big room with mats on the floor and people were wrestling, then one asked me if I wanted to and threw me on the floor. All of a sudden I found myself in another room where a boxing ring was and I was standing in the ring with big gloves on (and these gloves were on backwards) and I began to fight and was hit with a right across and the bell sounded. I woke up to the alarm going off."
"0328"	"I dreamt that I was taking some kind of a test and there were other people of my age. There was a teacher or professor who was giving this test and instead of having the test written out, it was coming over a PA system and we would write the answers down. The room that we were in was big like a hall and it had tables for many more students than were there. These PA systems were put all over the hall and the voice rang through the hall. As I can remember after the test we were marched out in single file and then driven to a barracks then we were locked in. That is all I can remember."
"0329"	"The dream began with myself standing at a bottom of a short stone stairway leading into a basement hall of a castle. I had on a page's outfit and had a quarter master whistle around my neck and I piped people in and out of the castle. This girl came in but was a common girl so I didn't pipe for her. We talked and somehow we fell in love. Then the king came in to the hall. People hustled around. They had on beautiful clothes and the women had many jewels on too. I gave this girl a beautiful ring and all of a sudden the people were gone and the girl and I were alone in a different room. The king came in. He didn't look familiar, but he was tall and nice-looking. He carried a beautiful robe with pearls on it and trimmed with white ermine fur. He put it around my shoulders and then put a crown on my head and said I was his son and now I was king. Then I went back to the girl. The people left the room and I took the ring I had given her and gave her a large diamond surrounded by three sapphires and some little diamonds. Then I put the other ring on the finger next to it and said that it would be an engagement ring until we were married."
"0330"	"I was in a big building in which a lot of people lived. It might have been some kind of a dormitory, but it wasn't familiar although I have been in the same room several times before. I went down a hall and turned left. At the end of the hall are suites of faculty members. The room is small with one window. There is a sewing machine in the room, a desk, a table on which there is some kind of machine with a switch on it. In the room are a number of old style goose-necked lamps. I turned on the lamps as I looked for something; can't remember what it was. I went outside with a friend and it was snowing. On a certain street at home downtown in the business district, we were driving an automobile and there were huge trucks like car carriers. Red, a little different from the real thing -- enclosed on the bottom. There were about 10 of them around. My friend was driving in and out of these trucks. I was quite tense when she hit one of the trucks. No one was hurt or even the car damaged."
"0331"	"For some reason I was making a phone call to find someone whose first name was Stankey. The phone rang. I ran to answer it but no one answered. As I sat there waiting I had a tremendous pain in my upper back tooth. To relieve the pain I gritted them. The more the pain the more I gritted them. As a result the tooth began to crumble. Running to the kitchen sink, I spit out piece after piece of broken tooth. (There was no sign of blood.) I returned to the phone and this Stankey was waiting quite impatiently. All the time I wished I hadn't made the call in fact from the very beginning. The result of it, if any at all, I have forgotten."
"0332"	"I was walking late one evening up Main Street (in Akron) looking in the store windows. I remember stopping and looking in the store windows several times. One time I stopped and looked at a large figurine -- a black china negro which had fallen face down in a dime store window display. The next window in front of which I stopped contained a large double bed all made with bedspread and all. The unusual feature was the presence of several life-size toy cocker spaniels all over the bed all lying down with faces toward the street. I continued on my way up the street desiring to take in a movie. I remember standing in a long line for a ticket and when I got inside I saw that the place was quite crowded and the feature hadn't started yet. I didn't stop walking, but walked right back outside and ran across the street to another theatre. The cashier girl was closing the office and wasn't going to sell me a ticket at first, but decided she didn't have anything to lose so I went into the movie. The theatre was strangely arranged. It was very, very narrow, drapes were hanging everywhere and the floor was terribly warped. Many persons showed their disgust for my interruption, but I sat, very uncomfortably in the crooked seat on a slant with the floor."
"0333"	"I was one of many persons visiting an electric power plant at a dam. A guide was showing all the complicated machinery and turbines to the visitors. Everywhere I seemed to walk one of the dynamos or turbines would stop rotating. The guide would come running and with a swift twist would start them again. There were all kinds of railings and balconies and no order was required as to where the visitors were to be. This being so I found myself with a few others going up an elevator to a higher level. For some reason I was soon on the way down again. Suddenly the car stopped and the elevator girl was frightened. We tried to move it to the next door below but it wouldn't move; we apparently were stuck. Then the lights went out. One of the turbines generating the electricity must have stopped. I cannot remember how it all came out, but I do remember feeling quite disturbed in the plight which encompassed us."
"0334"	"I was at a friend's house sitting in their dining room. I remember holding something like a brush and I was painting what appeared to be crackers. They kept breaking as I held the corners as I painted them. The paint was thick, almost like cheese. People kept remarking what a wonderful job I was doing. As I continued my buddy's sister let out a whoop running to the side window. It was her father returning home. I looked out too and saw him driving his car up the driveway. Someone had painted it just as I was painting the crackers. The paint also looked like cheese, very streaked and crumbling where it had dried out in places. The crackers I was working with were to be eaten for supper."
"0335"	"I was at a gas station near the viaduct bridge in Akron asking to have a tire repaired. (I was riding a bicycle.) The tube shrank up into a piece of rubber like the end of an air pump. The attendant was showing me the puncture. The next thing I knew the attendant was a girl and she began questioning who I was. I told her I had lived in that neighborhood all my life. After a while she recalled having seen me before. She fixed the tube. All the while I was anxious to leave. One of my buddies had just bought a car and he had given me the keys. I was anxious to take a ride. I left the girl quite abruptly and found the car where it was left for me, but I couldn't get in to drive it."
"0336"	"It was the night before finals and I couldn't find my books. I looked all through the dorms but I still couldn't find them. Finally I decided to break into the bookstore and took the books I needed. Just as I was leaving the building I was caught by President Knight. Then I woke up."
"0337"	"I dreamt I was fighting with someone and I couldn't hit him. He seemed to be fast and he could hit me at will. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't hit him. My blows seem to be slow and lacked force."
"0338"	"I dreamt I woke up and went to the head and when I came back the room was all changed all around. There was an extra desk in the room. I then went to bed and when I woke up (still in dream) I couldn't find my books. No matter how I tried, I couldn't find them."
"0339"	"I dreamt that someone broke into our house and tore up everything. But the odd part is that only a small valueless flower pot was stolen. Another thing which I recall very clearly is the way they broke into the house. They broke in the back door. It seemed they just pushed in the door but it was still on its hinges swinging back and forth."
"0340"	"I dreamt I joined the Air Force and I was flying jets in Korea. I had 40 enemy aircraft to my credit. All I had to do was shoot down one more plane and I would exceed Major Bong's record of 40 planes and set a new record of planes shot by United States aviators. I was on a mission somewhere over the enemy lines. I spotted my 41st plane and had him in my crosshairs and was just about to press the firing button when I woke up."
"0341"	"The dream started out on one of my father's jobs. We had just about finished building a brick store and were trying to finish up this day. The job was near Donna's home (my girlfriend) and she used to drop around once in a while. Gilbert (a close friend of mine) was helping us finish up and was on the roof looking down at the street working. He was off balance and almost fell. I told him to be careful because I couldn't catch him if he fell. My father came over and just about that time Gilbert fell and Dad and I caught him. It seemed very easy. Later I went over to Donna's to say goodbye. I was leaving for school. The rest is not clear because someone woke me up."
"0342"	"I was listening to the radio in my home when a news broadcast came on. It stated that Kay Starr, the singer, had been killed in an auto crash in Hollywood, California. I seemed very shocked at this notice of her death. I turned to another station and the program was a record show. The first piece I heard was by Kay Starr. I turned the radio off."
"0343"	"A group of fellows and I were on our way to a baseball game in Pittsburgh. We were walking along the street and one fellow by name of Robert Charlton was leading us. We didn't have our tickets so we stepped into this building to buy tickets out of some sort of machine. Different colors and prices determined where you would sit. I was the last one to put my money in the machine. It went out of order and I got about 20 of the best tickets free. I joined the other fellows on the street and proceeded to the ball park. The next thing I know is that we were in a large crowd. I saw several people I knew, Gilbert, male, and his sister."
"0344"	"It was the day of a major track meet. The coach had very little interest in my career at the time because of all his stars from previous years. They were graduating so he let me run for experience only. I won both the 440 and 880, and was he surprised. I thought I was going to die I was so sick, but I came out ok. My times were the best of the year and those 10 points of mine eventually won the meet. Thereafter the coach paid a little more attention to me. I had had the ability all along but lacked interest and wouldn't work too hard."
"0345"	"It started in the afternoon of a very important day to me. There was a big formal dance going on this night. I went to the garage to get the car and when I tried to start the car nothing happened. I looked under the hood and the motor was missing. What a surprise. I called my uncle and told him what happened -- 'someone has stolen the motor out of the car.' We looked around the garage for clues and found the motor in a vacant lot next to the garage. It had been taken apart and scattered all around. It took us two days to put it together."
"0346"	"I was walking up town one night when all of a sudden someone started chasing me. Naturally I started running too. I circled around the block but he seemed to keep after me. I kept running, running and before I knew it, I came to the edge of the pier and couldn't stop myself. I started falling and then I woke up."
"0347"	"The concert was overflowing with people. Out on the stage stepped Nelson Eddy, America's favorite baritone. I had talked to him before the concert and told him that someday I would like to sing on this very stage. Imagine my surprise when he asked me to sing several numbers on the program with him, the great Nelson Eddy."
"0348"	"I heard a burglar downstairs and I went downstairs after him. I jumped him and we started to fight. He had a knife in his hand and he slashed my shoulder. He got up and ran away with me getting up and chasing him. I kept running and running while I was getting weaker. I finally caught him and we started fighting again. He got me down and pulled his knife on me. Just as he was ready to stab me I woke up."
"0350"	"Our hunting expedition was in deepest Africa and we were going through the dark underbrush. I was the last one in the group. All at once caught by surprise I was caught by a python snake. Struggle as I would, I could not break away from the death grip. Gradually I felt my strength leave me and I hollered to no avail. Suddenly I awoke with a bang on the dormitory door. My covers were wrapped tight around my body."
"0352"	"I was sleeping in bed and I felt something touch me. I looked over and saw a huge animal, something like I had never seen before. I jumped out of bed and began to run and run and I looked around to see where this monster was. Just as I looked around, this thing was ready to grab me and I woke up."
"0353"	"I was in my home in New Castle, Pa, with my parents. There was a foreign army marching outside. Our house was being guarded by a soldier in front and a soldier in back. There was also an enemy soldier sitting in the front. Our family was huddling in the kitchen trying to think of a way to escape. We decided to sneak down to the cellar and go out an obscure door that was very seldom used. We went down the stairs quietly so that the soldier in the front room would not hear us. Our family got out the door safely and then we all ran in different directions. I ran and ran and ran and the next thing I knew I was awake."
"0354"	"I was swimming about in the water when I felt something pulling on my leg. As I was being pulled under I began to yell and scream. As I looked for help I could see afar off a beautiful girl jump into the water and start swimming toward me. It seemed like she would never get there because I was just about to go under. I let out one last yell and as I sank I woke up with a start."
"0355"	"I was at a train station early in the morning seeing BW's basketball team off. One of the players came running up and just made the train. The next thing I remember was that evening when I saw the players back again in the dorm. I did not know some of their names but I knew the faces. Just when I was going to find out why they were back I woke up."
"0356"	"I was eating in a corner cafeteria when I happened to recognize one of my old schoolmates. Her name was Pat. Pat seemed to be managing the restaurant and had various employees working under her. All of a sudden I felt an ice cream cone being shoved into my hand. After I ate a little bit of the cone, I happened to drop the ice cream on the floor of the store. Pat immediately told one of her employees to pick it up for me. However, after they had picked up the cream, I refused to eat it for some unknown reason."
"0357"	"This dream happened in Virginia on one of its many mountains. While walking on one of these mountains, a large brown black bear appeared before me. I immediately took off down the side of the mountain because I knew that a bear's front legs are shorter than his rear ones. So if he (the bear) had to run on a downgrade he would trip. Just when I thought I had escaped, my feet seemed glued to the ground. I remained almost motionless however hard I tried to make my legs move. The bear was upon me in an instant and at that time I woke in a cold sweat."
"0358"	"I was flying a small single-motored airplane called a piper cub with my close boyfriend, John. We were high in the skies, in fact we were above the clouds. All of a sudden the engine sputtered and I realized that we were out of gas. We lost altitude fast and as we neared the ground, one of our wings struck a high-growing tree. In a moment I realized the results of the crash. Our plane was a complete mess and furthermore John was dead. I heard another plane flying overhead and somehow began signaling with smoke signals. This strange plane began to come down but saw that we were in a narrow valley so he decided to pull out. He didn't quite make it because I heard his landing gear hit the side of the opposite mountain. I woke."
"0359"	"A large city with all its funny noises was the setting of this dream. I guess the city's name was Cleveland although I could notice no familiar things. Suddenly a large black truck loomed before me. As I jumped its front fender caught my foot. The truck immediately stopped and from the car the driver appeared. He began asking if I was all right. After I assured him that I wasn't badly hurt, he told me that I should have jumped up in the air instead of ducking to avoid the car (truck). After this I got up off the street and walked away as if it had not ever happened."
"0360"	"I was driving a terrifically fast hot rod down one of the main highways of Cleveland when one of the city prowl cars pulled up beside me. He asked me where I was going so I told him that I was almost late for the Bedford races. At this, he told me to follow him. So we raced through traffic at the distress of the siren. They immediately put a number on my hood, and I found myself in the midst of a close race. I was just turning a corner when my rod started to jump out of control. A pole in the side of the fence loomed before me and I ducked."
"0361"	"Was in a hotel with seven floors. My suite was on the seventh. Can't remember the room itself, but I left to go down to the lobby. Used the stairs, took the wrong door at the bottom and ended up outside. Walked around and went back in entering the lobby first. I think, because of my attire, I had to make a fast exit, so headed for the elevator. Got in and the operator talked and talked. We kept going up and up, past the seventh floor and it puzzled me to feel as if we were still moving up having passed the top floor. The door opened eventually and the operator and a colleague waiting on the roof tried to roll me. I said I only had two bucks on me. To show him I pulled out a bill which was a five. That startled me and both of them pounced on me. With this I awakened."
"0362"	"In a house not known to me. I seemed to be waiting for someone. For some reason I left and went uptown to meet by chance my ex-girl's father (44). We talked a little bit, got along quite well, which was an exception, and then headed back for the house with him. Just from writing this, the house comes to me. It was his. I knew there was some ice cream in the ice box and he offered me some rootbeer. So I thought I'd combine the two for a Boston cooler. Dream faded."
"0363"	"Was getting ready to play basketball in a big gym that looked brand new. Had a little trouble about getting my uniform but finally secured one. Remember a lot of running around on the court and in the locker room. Recall some actual playing and then leaving the arena with an old friend same age as me. We had two girls around our age, mine being a blond. My date had to get home for some reason, but we were having trouble locating the house even though she lived in it. Finally we reached a street where the names on the right hand side were set high above the street due to the terrain in that territory. We spotted the house, but my friend drove on past. Then he turned around and came back and I took her in. Fade out."
"0364"	"My brother and I were in Canada fishing in our motorboat. So without having any luck, we started for the cabin. I was steering when we came into an area known too well by us. The rocks up there are treacherous. We hit the rocks just submerged beneath surface and the boat went over. I kept my head and flipped the boat back over very easily even though the boat is large. It was still full of water, but still floating and we got it to the bank. The next thing I knew we were telling my dad the story. Right away he put us to work carrying lumber. I got mad when he hinted at us that we didn't have any brains. I was just carrying a piece in the cabin when I woke."
"0365"	"Was courting an exgirlfriend (23) but the time seemed at that time. I popped the question to her one night and we got married the next week, no pomp, no big ceremony. But here is where her father stepped into the picture. He declared the marriage null and void and through connections, got the marriage annulled. I was amazed at the simplicity of all the procedure and I was relieved that this was so. I was confronted by friends later and they could hardly believe it had happened. Yet I seemed unconcerned and rather relieved that obligations had been severed. The dream faded at that point."
"0366"	"I was downtown at home in a pool hall talking to some friends, Wells, by name. They lived in back of my grandmother's house. I had dinner at Grandma's then went next door to get a ride back downtown. The people who should have been Wells, turned out to be Dreys, Wayne and Jane (more friends). I got my ride down in a cream and brown station wagon, just newly painted. I knew that the Dreys have no station wagon. They were talking of selling the station wagon and getting a new car but were afraid of trade in allowance. The station wagon had been used very hard. Also Truman's new 20% auto tax would hit very hard. Stop at bookstore to get change for some reason not remembered. Jane sees frat pin says, ""Frat man now, huh?"""
"0367"	"Riding along a highway in a friend's car (Loren, some town friend) to play a game of golf. Just after entering a fairly long straight away of an S curve we see a car approaching us at a terrific rate of speed. Just after it goes by us this car tries to pass another car at the time another car is coming along. The result is a terrible crash with the passing car getting squeezed like an accordian and the car on the left hand side having its side bashed in. No remembered damage to third car. Knowing full well that unless someone warns the people coming up from the blind curve that there will be more wreckage strewn along the road. Just as I started down the road the state cops came along. Evidently they had been following the speeder. A police helicopter hovering overhead ordered ambulances and other police to the scene. Most of the people I slowed down swore at me first until they learned what had happened. From the screech of tires, everyone was going too fast for the curve. There was also a bridge just after the curve. There was a lot of damage and quite a few people injured. The police drew a diagram of the scene of the accident to have us furnish proof of what happened. The three boys in the car that caused the accident were all young. Only one had a driver's license and he wasn't driving. What happened, I don't know. Woke up just then."
"0368"	"Double dating with a fraternity brother. I was with a tall blond 5'9"", just a little taller than I am. I was going to a scheduled party. Just before we went in we got to laughing about height; the girl said it didn't make any difference. The girl was Marcia, from home, and I had never been out with her or consciously had a desire to do so. At this party was a girl I had been going with just recently. She was wearing a red dress (part of costume for skit told me in advance). Nothing has been said at all about our not dating anymore. Since I leave her alone and concentrate on other women, particularly my date, she begins asking questions as to why and what and why I am moody. I answer that I am not moody or particularly avoiding her."
"0369"	"I had been to a party and was all dressed up. I was carrying an umbrella and wearing a derby. On the way home I stopped at a very tough tavern. I bought myself a shot of whiskey and stood at the bar drinking it. Right next to me was a big, unshaven man who orderd a double shot and said I would pay for it. The bartender said, ""Oh, no,"" and took it away from him. I then took the double, passed it down as if it were water, picked up my derby and umbrella and started on home. A little further on I passed a beat-up old building that seemed to house both second-hand and new stores. I went in to look around. The first place I stopped was the sports department and looked at golf clubs, golf bag, and golf balls. The bag was an exact replica of the one I wanted, had a zipper all the way down and was big enough to cover me completely. Since I had no money I said I would be back. The owners, who seemed to be one big family, told me to look around. I went into the toy and fabric shops. Lastly I went into a beverage shop where an old man, head of the family, was making coffee. He asked me to have some and I said, ""Yes."" He was just making a mixture of different brews when I woke up."
"0370"	"I was lined up with another group of men, all before a head monk undergoing questioning to become a monk. All the men in the group came from different countries and I was the only one who spoke English. The final question was a math question. After that we were shown our quarters and told not to do any talking at all. Pretty soon I wandered downstairs, picked up a Life magazine and started to read. The article was on the sadistic way the Russians killed their prisoners. Of the three ways the one I most remembered was the one of kicking a person to death. I then went into the head. When I got through I heard a woman say, ""You are not supposed to go in there. It's private."" I looked around and saw a bed with a very old woman asleep. I then realized I was in the house of a friend."
"0371"	"I went to Canada on a vacation trip. On the way I met this girl and she said she was going to the same place that I was going. Somehow we both started out on this trip around Canada together. We got involved in an argument over the fish in a couple of the lakes and then the boat must have upset because we were both in the water. She seemed to have disappeared in the water. I stayed up on one of those islands always trying to find her but it seems I could never do it."
"0372"	"I started out shopping in New York City. I met an old friend and we shopped around together. After we were done shopping it seemed as if we were then engaged in a game of pool. He was betting me money left and right over some shots and I was cleaning up. A crowd started to gather as I was making shot after shot. My friend then dropped from the game because he was losing too much money or he quit for other reasons. Then it seems that I was entering the crowd that had gathered to play me. The room was filled with cigar smoke, money was always on the table and I kept on winning. When I finally stopped playing my friend told me that I was playing against some of the roughest boys engaged in the art."
"0373"	"I was sitting in a classroom reading something when one of the professors approached me with a smiling face. As he reached for my slide rule which lay on the table, I noticed that he carried a large scissors. He removed the slide rule from its cover and without trouble at all bisected it transversally before I could interfere. Cheerfully he handed me the one-half of the rule, and as I stared at him questioning his actions, he explained to me that half a slide rule was just as good and besides it occupied less space. The last thing I remember was that I was testing with considerable success his suggestion."
"0374"	"I was seized by a bunch of men and then shoved into a black sedan. I next was taken by the seashore and I thought I would be killed by them throwing me into the water. I remember next being left on a lonely road. It was cold that night and I can remember I didn't feel too warm. I remember vastness dark and dreary, but I walked until I saw a light. This light was small as a pinpoint and I was drifting in space. I remember turning upside down and I had a dizzy feeling. I tried, but I could not approach the light. I woke up then."
"0375"	"It was a warm summer day. I was extremely thirsty. I seemed to be wandering around an endless dry plain, and I was lost. In my great need I suddenly saw a girl dressed in a bathing suit, consisting only of pants. She was very friendly, looked quite inviting and offered to help me. I told her of my urgent desire and she led the way running. As we reached a small and clean fountain, I hurled myself next to her on the ground and drank eagerly, enjoying it greatly. As an ejaculation occurred, I woke up."
"0376"	"I dreamt that it was the day after the BW Kent State basketball game. Percy, a fellow I played high school basketball with and who now plays for Kent State, had stayed overnight with me apparently. I was showing him around our campus. The boiler room was located about where Centennial Hall now is. We went there and were talking about the BW team, about Daniel and Jim in particular. They came in and sat down and talked with us for a short time. Percy and I left. I showed him some of the buildings around campus. We then went downtown and were supposedly on our way to the Grindstone when I woke up."
"0377"	"I appeared with a friend of mine in a downtown department store. It was night and the store was closed. There was a faint light, enough to see by. My friend stood by without emotion with apparent loyalty while I selected different clothes that I wanted, especially sweaters. After a short time my mother appeared. She too stood by while I handed her different articles I had picked out. While I was still looking over clothes it became dawn and almost immediately time for the store to open. The three of us were hiding behind counters as the store clerks came in. This is where the dream trailed into nothing."
"0378"	"I was in a strange town, living at a strange hotel. It occurred to me that I was at a convention of some sort. I seemed to be floating not walking around. I spoke to people easily and casually but do not remember any of the people and it occurred to me at the time that I did not know them. I kept looking for clothing stores. I had a desire to buy some clothes. I kept looking but couldn't find anything but drug stores, jewelry stores and fruit stores. I became frustrated and started back to my hotel. When I got to my hotel I noticed that on both sides of it was located a jewelry store."
"0379"	"I awoke cast on the beach of an island (presumably shipwrecked) with Janet, a girl from my hometown. We traveled around the whole island and found it to be level, about two miles in circumference and completely uninhabited. We had nothing but the clothes we were wearing. I set to work building a rough lean-to for the night. She gathered a wild grain stalk (either hay or wheat) to make a mattress of a sort. We got all of this material possible to put over us anticipating a cold night. We talked over our plight and made tentative plans for the next day. We retired early. As the night got colder she cuddled close to me. I kissed and embraced her and felt that she was completely mine. I respected her too much to take advantage of her and make love to her. With this thought the dream just trailed off into nothing."
"0380"	"I boarded a bus coming from Akron back into Cuyahoga Falls. Sitting in the last seat on the right hand side was a girl with the looks and body and reputation to start pleasant thoughts. I sat down beside her and started a conversation. What was said seemed unimportant for our mouths moved, but I heard nothing. I began to feel her leg. She didn't resist. I asked for her phone number, which she gave me. This seemed foolish for I can still remember her phone number. By the time I had gone far enough with her to know that we both had the same desires, and that she was willing in any case, my bus stop came. I told her I could call her that night. I got off the bus and the dream ended."
"0381"	"I was a guest at a dinner party, at which all the people present seemed to be members of my fraternity. My mother and I sat side-by-side at the large table. There were a few older people there whose number seemed to constantly increase. They were quite jovial and one lady in particular was exceedingly adept at relating funny anecdotes. I don't remember anything of what was said."
"0382"	"I dreamed that I was watching a group of my fraternity brothers playing a game of baseball. They were quite a distance from me, and rather than a game, some sort of batting practice seemed to be in progress. Every once in a while a baseball would come out as far as the place I was standing (or kneeling?). Each time I would get a ball I would keep it. I soon had three. Looking at the balls closely I noticed that none was very hard and that they were quite irregular in shape, though they did retain the size, and approximate shape of an ordinary baseball."
"0383"	"I dreamed that it was morning and that I was to wake up the other men sleeping on the second floor of my fraternity house. I picked up a dry mop (my roommate is a part-time brush salesman and frequently has such in the room). Grasping it by the mop end, I proceeded to go around waking up all the sleepers in the house. This I did by poking them in the chest with the handle of the mop. The last I came to was my roommate (roommates since last September -- his age 24). Instead of the chest I poked him in the genital area and was surprised to find that the handle penetrated into his body to a depth of several inches. I wiggled the mop handle around to waken him, at which time there appeared several other men who seemed to be quite astonished. The last thing I remember was asking him how in the world it had been possible to make the insertion without injuring him. I can't remember what his answer was."
"0384"	"I dreamed that I was coming downstairs in the fraternity house into the living room where I saw the photographer with his camera already set up. The hood and bellows of the camera were white, and formed a long streamlined-looking affair such as no other type of portrait apparatus I've ever seen. At this time I set about diligently to attempt to organize the men and assign them their times of sitting. Suddenly I was reminded of the time and realized that I was already late for some kind of a church group function at some other part of the city. I woke up in the throes of a great inner struggle to try to straighten out the muddled picture-taking situation while still not being any later in getting to the church program."
"0385"	"My baby cousin Betsie, an Army associate of mine, and I were sitting in a restaurant in the neighborhood of the WRU campus. The suggestion was made to leave and go elsewhere for a while. The place chosen was another eating place in the vicinity which had closed for the night. (It is really open all the time.) We knocked on the side door and were admitted to a view of the floor show then in progress. The attraction of the evening was a fraternity brother of mine who was introducing the next act: a group of singers who were to sing in old Scotch dialect. Involved somehow in the dream was a bet in which I lost a sum of money."
"0386"	"Dreamt that I was in Bond's store returning a tie which I had purchased and then discovered a flaw in it. It was the only tie of its kind in the store. Though there were several hundred other ties there, I couldn't find one that I liked. So the salesman said that they would send to Rochester and have one made for me out of a perfect piece of goods."
"0387"	"I was at a beach on the lake with a very tall blonde girl. We had been in swimming and were relaxing in the sun. She was an extraordinarily good-looking girl and was attracting quite a bit of attention from the other men on the beach. We then drove to her home and had sandwiches and beer. We then made a date to go dancing the next night, after which I went home. I do not know the girl to my best knowledge, I've never actually seen her."
"0388"	"I was out in a heavy rainstorm at night. I was wearing a sou'wester hat and an army raincoat. I must have had boots on, for my feet were not wet. The area I was in was not built up, although there were streets and sidewalks. I was experiencing a deep feeling of sympathy for the people who were not clothed for the weather as I was."
"0389"	"I was driving along Superior Avenue when I saw the owner of the filling station where I do business being beaten up by three or four thugs. I swung into a side street about E.108, took a hammer out of my tool kit and went back to the fight. I hit one of the thugs with the hammer, striking the back of his head with all my might. He turned and told me to beat it. Mike, the victim, then told me to go on, they were some of his friends from Brooklyn."
"0390"	"I was standing in a kitchen talking to a colored cook. She told me that she always bought her fish whole and prepared them for cooking herself. She pointed out to a huge ice box standing in the backyard. The door was open, and inside was a large fish. While I watched, the fish rolled over, sprouted legs, and crawled away. I started to yell for a gun. We had to kill it before it killed someone. The owner of the house came running in clad in undershorts only and handed me an old bolt action rifle with a white handle, and a box of bullets marked M-1404 B. 30 cal. I ran out the door after the animal. The house appeared from the kitchen and the backyard to be my fraternity house."
"0391"	"I was at an amusement park with my girlfriend. We stopped at one of the booths and I threw darts at balloons. With three darts I burst three balloons. A lot of people were gathered around me and praising me. A group of men put me on their shoulders and we paraded around the park. Everyone was cheering and clapping."
"0395"	"I was skiing down a large hill with a companion I did not recognize. Near the bottom was a jump which I went over. There was a crowd of people there and they all applauded. I took off my skis and went into an old barn which was nearby. I climbed an old ladder into the loft. There I found a broken iron rabbit such as is used at the dog tracks (during the race it stays just in front of the dogs). Holding it, I jumped from the loft. The ladder had fallen."
"0396"	"I was climbing through a window of a place that I somehow took for a drugstore. I saw my sister sitting on a chair. She had just gotten married and I ran over to kiss her. While kissing her I picked her up off the chair and started twirling her around but she was too heavy for me and I had to quit. There was a crowd of people standing around and when I said that she was too big for me to twirl around everybody laughed."
"0397"	"I was sitting on a sofa with my girl's girlfriend. I was waiting for my girl to arrive and her girlfriend told me she had gone out with somebody else. I swore, and this girl not liking swearing, asked me what I said. I asked her if she heard me and she laughed and said, ""No."" I kissed her after that. Just as I was doing this my mother walked through the room. She simply looked at us and walked right on through without saying a word."
"0398"	"I was sitting in the kitchen at the table and there was a large crowd of people in the room with me. My mother was at the stove cooking. Through the open door I saw my brother-in-law, from out of town, and I told my mother she was in for a surprise. My brother-in-law came through the door and then I looked over at my mother, but she wasn't there anymore. In her place was my sister, the brother-in-law's wife. They each let out with a whoop and kissed each other."
"0399"	"I dreamed I was in a beer garden drinking beer, when all of a sudden I saw an old girlfriend of mine sitting on the stool next to mine. She was supposed to have been married and I asked her about it. She said that her engagement was broken and the next thing I knew I was in bed with her in my bedroom. Then I had a noctural emission."
"0400"	"I had a dream within a dream in which I went to sleep and had a wet dream. I woke up in my second dream and started to take off my underwear in preparation for a shower. To my surprise I found out that they weren't wet, so I went back to sleep. Then I woke up out of my first dream and found out that my underwear were wet, so I had to take them off and take a shower."
"0401"	"I was climbing up a mountain slope through a dense forest of evergreens. It was dark and cold and a thick mist hung low in the woods. I had the feeling that I had been climbing for hours and hours. In some way although it was not actually visible, I could see the top of the mountain, a great, white gleaming mass of ice and snow. I felt somehow that everything was against my ever reaching the top, but at the same time I had an odd feeling of confidence in the fact that nothing could stop me from reaching it. Next I found myself at timberline and looked back down over the miles of forest through which I had climbed. I suddenly felt marvelously happy and laughed and shouted, ""Fools, fools,"" at person or persons unknown below me. Then I turned again toward the summit which now seemed very near and awe-inspiring in its beauty. I woke feeling very lighthearted and was quite disappointed when I found that I had been only dreaming."
"0402"	"I walked into a small apartment lighted with a dim yellow light. It is well furnished and the most conspicuous thing is a maroon davenport. On this sits a short dark-haired slender girl. She is very pretty and stimulates me sexually immediately. She stretches and says something to me in a foreign tongue which I answer but I did not understand it. I remove my coat and throw it on a chair and sit down next to her. Suddenly I feel very sorry for her and begin to cry and say, ""It's all my fault. They'll pay for this."" I take her in my arms and stroke her hair at the same time, muttering, ""You poor unknowing, unseeing little creature -- what a damned filthy trick."" She then says in a very sweet voice with a slight French accent (I once was quite familiar with a French-Canadian girl with a French accent), ""It is all right, Jimmy. Soon we will be up in the sky again."" I woke up, feeling very blue."
"0403"	"I appear to have been in the National Guard of Ohio. I was witnessing the trial of three of my best friends (in real life) who were convicted of some crime worthy of capital punishment. In the next scene my friends are all lined up before a large firing squad and are about to be executed. The officer in charge gives the commands, ""Ready, aim -- "" and just then I cry that some enemy has attacked Toledo and that all the guardsmen must hurry to its defense. The officer stops the execution and hurries off with his firing squad. I feel very much pleased at the clever ruse I have succeeded in and am just puzzling over a way to escape the area when I awake."
"0404"	"I was lying on my stomach in a high sand dune in a vast western desert. It might have been Nevada. It was evening and the sun had just gone down and it was very cool and comfortable. Far off in the distance I could see a purple range of mountains. I was very comfortable and peaceful. I remember thinking, ""I'll have to think it all out. No, there's no need for thinking any more. The whole problem is resolved. This is the final solution."" I was conscious of a gentle swelling and sinking feeling as if I were drifting in the sea. At the last minute, just before I awoke I was suddenly filled with a nameless feeling of fright and dread."
"0405"	"In the following dream I was lying on my bed in my own bedroom and at the time I was dreaming I was not sure whether I was awake or asleep. I lay on my bed for a while and then heard someone coming up the stairs to my room. I tried to call out and ask who it was but was unable to speak. The footsteps slowly came closer and at last entered my bedroom. I saw the person, evidently a man, and was overcome with fear. I tried to get up to get to my gun rack which is just outside my bedroom door, but I was unable to move. Finally, just before I awoke, I was released from the spell and dashed to my gunrack. I took out a rifle and turned to face the unknown visitor, only to find that it was a small boy who was greatly concerned over my apparent desire to harm him. I felt rather foolish at becoming so terrified at the presence of such a small child and then woke up."
"0406"	"This dream was short, very vivid and made a deep impression. It took place in a very dingy and depressing room which was about 20 ft. square. The room was part of a prison. One wall was lined with bunks five high. I was in the top bunk. A door was in the wall that was perpendicular to the beds. The room was not painted and was not plastered but covered with cement and had the gloomy gray color of cement. The blankets of the bed were pulled up to my neck and were of a blackish gray. A guard (whom I didn't know and whose age I didn't notice) came into the room with a package for me. I tried to get out of the bunk to get the package. I threw the covers back but I couldn't get down to the floor."
"0407"	"The dream started in a ship. Some people and I were walking some prisoners. Five escaped. A man who I did not recognize shoved a gun in my hand. I then had the feeling of safety and reassurance. Scene changed to the main floor of a large department store. Up to now all persons in dream were male, unknown to me and ages were not observed. In the store I saw one of the persons we were chasing. I then realized that he was a good friend of mine. The person who was with me and seeking the prisoners was unknown and older than me (between 30 and 40). My friend (the prisoner) was walking down a flight of stairs from the second floor to the first floor. I saw his head over a show case. The scene now had my friend in a show case. I talked to him but I couldn't hear what I said. I took the gun and squeezed the trigger. The gun may have shot and it may not have. At the time I didn't think it did. My friend then said he was sorry and that he was glad to have known me. Then he said goodbye. Then the scene changed. I was in a strange bed. My mother woke me and told me my friend had died on the way to the hospital. I started to sob. Then I began to wonder whether I had shot my friend or not."
"0408"	"I was lying in bed. My uncle came into the room. He said something about the development of aortic arches. Then my uncle was replaced by my former piano teacher (male). He started to talk about doughnuts and tubes. Piano teacher said each doughnut weighed one pound because of these special tubes. Therefore a dozen weighed two ton. He asked me if I'd like a doughnut. Then the front wall of the bedroom was gone. Instead there was a baking shop. He got a bag of doughnuts. He showed me the doughnuts with tubes. He offered me a doughnut. I took one. He took what looked like a cupcake. It had chocolate icing. He took a chair and sat at the foot of my bed."
"0409"	"I was walking down the street (strange). Suddenly the scene changed and I was in a shabby room. I remember the room to be shabby but nothing else. There were several people in the room. One was a girl who looked very tired. With audacity that amazed me, I put my hands on her breasts. We sat down in a chair -- she on my lap. Nocturnal emission occurred."
"0410"	"I had a date with a girl. I called for her and we went out in the street. Then I was in the living room of my home and the girl was there too. We were sitting on the sofa in the living room. I had my arm around the girl. She was resting her head on my shoulder. I was telling her I loved her. An outstanding feature of this dream was that in the dream I kept thinking I must control my sexual desire."
"0411"	"In this dream I found myself back in the Marine Corps, seated at some bar evidently pitching liberty. I was aware of a young lady seated next to me of indistinguishable age. I felt I was getting pleasantly drunk and she began to look invitingly at me when two sailors about my age approached her and proceeded to maul her. I told them to leave the lady alone whereupon they became very pugnacious. I kneed one in the groin as I had been taught and turned around just in time to see the other one wallop me with a beer bottle. I woke up at this point."
"0412"	"I was lying on a beach next to the ocean with the sound of the waves in my ears. The sun was bright but pleasantly warm. I closed my eyes to keep out its brightness and when I opened them again the sun had set and the world was bathed in twilight. Suddenly the waves parted and a girl strode toward me. I looked around and to my surprise found we were alone. Not speaking she lay down by my side and we had intercourse."
"0413"	"I was standing on a bridge over the middle of a river. It was damp, cold and foggy. Suddenly four horsemen appeared at one end of the bridge and began to shoot at me. They were about my age but unknown to me. At the same time a spectator on horseback sprang up from the river and took a position between us deflecting the bullets. He handed me four ivory-handled knives. I took them at his bidding and cast them (quite awkwardly) in the direction of the approaching man. They seemed to be charmed for they all found their mark."
"0414"	"My date of the evening and I were sitting in a theater restaurant when she mentioned the fact that the fellow on the stage at the moment had insulted her on a previous occasion and severely beaten her escort. For no good reason I climbed up on the stage and attacked him. He was about 25 and very formidable-looking but catching him by surprise I succeeded in knocking him down. The audience thought it was part of the performance and applauded."
"0415"	"I was lying down in a green meadow next to a brook. The sun was shining and everything was warm, green and quiet. I turned my head and saw a young lady of my acquaintance lying next to me. I put my arm around her and she pressed her body against mine. I undressed her and then tried to seduce her only to find that my organ seemed to be too large for her vagina thus making intercourse impossible."
"0416"	"I was in an underground cavern which was subdivided into several rooms where there were gambling games going. I had my shoes off and they were on a shelf at the end of the cavern. I was in a dice game when the police came in the front of the cavern. My brother-in-law was leading the police (he is 28). He grabbed my shoes and handed them to me and I went out the front door. There seemed to be great confusion in the back part of the cavern."
"0417"	"I was in my car in a parking lot and was just backing up to leave when a man in a big car (kind indefinite) pulled around my car and ran his car into my front fender. We both got out and I kept running from spectator to spectator saying, ""You saw it; who was in the wrong?"" I was very conscious of needing to get witnesses. The driver who had hit me remained silent and played no further part in the dream after he got out of his car."
"0418"	"I was riding in an old Model T Ford down a macadam road with large trees on each side of the road. This road was unfamiliar but seemed familiar. There were several other persons in the car but I could not tell who they were. There was one girl in the front seat along with another fellow and myself. We were going at a great speed and I awakened as the old car (which had no top) was about to turn over going around a curve."
"0419"	"I was in a transport airplane (army transport). I was in the rear of the fuselage next to the door. The airplane seemed to be out of control. I don't know how I knew this because it was flying perfectly. I just knew it was out of control and I was overwhelmed by fear. I was unable to go forward to the pilot's compartment or to move around at all. I was just gripped by this fear. I awoke too frightened to go back to sleep immediately."
"0420"	"I was on an assault boat in a beach landing and we were lowering a small boat over the side of the landing craft. I can't remember many details of the dream but I remember a great anxiety about the boat being swamped by large waves. There were many soldiers with me but I didn't identify any of them as members of my old army outfit."
"0421"	"I dreamt that I was walking down a strange street and passed a schoolyard. There one of my youngest brother's friends (age 10) saw me and followed me. I tried to chase him away, but he persisted in following me. I went to a house and met a strange attractive girl. I kissed her in the doorway, but she scolded me for kissing her in public. The little boyfriend of my brother was watching us. I finally chased him away, but felt ashamed for being a bit harsh with him. Then the girl and I went upstairs to her living room where we did some talking and some more kissing. Then I awoke."
"0422"	"I dreamt that I was an MP at Fort Knox. On a Saturday night I tried to go on pass, but an officer stopped me. He told me that I was restricted to my quarters for having unpressed pants. I went to the orderly room and saw John there (he was in my outfit in Japan). I was surprised to see him for he hated the army. We talked about our days in Japan. Then I awoke."
"0423"	"I dreamt that one of my friends and I were walking down a strange street at night. We walked for a while and then went into a bar. We had a few beers and then started to flirt with two blonds. Then I was playing softball in an empty lot near my home. I batted a long drive into left field and was dismayed when the fielder caught the ball."
"0424"	"I dreamt that I was in Toledo, Ohio. I was with my dad (45) in the railroad station waiting for the Cleveland train. A gateman told us to wait at the end of the platform for our coach. There were many people waiting with us. The train came, but went right by us. Everyone became very angry. My brother (20) hollered, ""They're sending a coach now."" I boarded the train first and found a double seat at the end of the coach which I claimed for my dad and myself. Then I was walking down a quiet residential street with a strange girl who agreed to have sexual relations with me after it became dark."
"0425"	"I dreamt that I was a spectator in the Cleveland stadium. There were many people there. We watched a baseball game. The pitcher was my brother (10). In the game the pitcher called balls and strikes because there were no umpires. The first pitch was a good one and my brother called it a strike. The next three pitches were wide of the plate and designated balls. That made the count three balls and one strike. The next pitch was bad but my brother called it a strike. This made me feel anxious."
"0426"	"I was standing in a room facing the front of the room. Before me were four large small-paned windows. On the wall between the first and second windows, just below where the wall met with the slanted roof was a pipe similar to a clothes rack. Also before the first two windows where the floor met the wall was a depression in the flooring about nine feet long, six inches deep and five inches wide. All my interests were focussed on why there was a depression in the floor while around me people spoke in English accent about an accident that happened in that very room."
"0427"	"I stepped out of a parked car and walked from the east end of the block where the car was parked to the extreme west end and entered a drugstore. There the girl who waited on me was seated in a chair behind the counter which was situated in a partially hidden corner of the room. We became quite friendly and at once I felt guilty about this because I remembered I had just left a girl seated in the car. The girl waitress resembled a great deal the girlfriend of the girl I had left in the car. I was torn between staying with this waitress or returning to the girl in the car. I remember returning to the car, driving past the drugstore, and not telling the girl about the waitress incident that just had taken place."
"0428"	"I was seated in an old-fashioned classroom near the center front of the class. Standing to my right in the front of the class were two girls, one dressed in a red dress with white dots and white fancy lace neckpiece, the other in a green dress with white dots and fancy collar. As I sat there I was very perturbed to see that the two girls had malformed short arms -- about one-half the length of normal arms. The teacher was reprimanding me for noticing the girls' deformities and noting that they were abnormal. I awoke feeling hurt and with my ego rather shaken."
"0429"	"I found myself walking up a ramp surrounded on all sides by both stands and booths similar to a raffle or country fair. As I walked up the gaily-colored avenue all other things seemed engulfed in a grey smog. As I walked forward the situation seemed to be familiar but yet I felt strangely afraid. At the close of the dream I felt very frustrated because I couldn't reach the end of the path."
"0430"	"The scene was the graduation exercises of my high school class. There were the usual addresses, speeches and the like. Throughout the program I was both graduate speaker as well as a member of the audience. The program continued with me jumping from role to role in a more and more frenzied state. Always with a deep foreboding feeling if I didn't hurry and do something I'd fail to complete some vague, undefinable task."
"0431"	"I dreamed that I was driving down a main highway and turned off the road to take a short route. The second road was dusty and full of lumps. I progressed about halfway when I noticed a funny noise under the hood. I stopped the car and as soon as I got out the hood raised automatically. The engine appeared as if it wanted to fly out and I could hear it creak and squeak. Quickly I jumped upon the hood and tried to hold it down. At first I was very successful but as my strength ebbed the force of the hood against me became stronger. I was fighting a losing battle and just as the engine was about to break loose I woke up."
"0432"	"I dreamed that I was helping my wife clean house, which incidentally I did do the day of the dream. She was working in the kitchen and I was putting up venetian blinds in the living room and dining room. As soon as I would complete putting the blinds up in the living room they would fall and I would become disgusted and attempt to erect the dining room blinds which would fall immediately after I put them up. This occurred many times until in anger and in haste I nailed the blinds to the molding. The funny part is that I had driven the nails in backwards but yet they seemed to serve the same purpose."
"0433"	"I dreamed I was in a strange city with a foreign appearance. The city resembled the antiquated city of Pompeii. I was eating dinner when all of a sudden a shout outdoors could be heard saying that we were being invaded by a nomadic infidel tribe. My reactions to this statement were those of fear and anger and quickly I sought to arm myself. Before I could accomplish this the enemy had entered the house. I among others were seized as prisoners. Next we were taken to a sort of jungle and told that our trial was coming up next. I looked out of the hut door and saw a person with a multitude of hideous sores tied to a stake. He screamed and I was told that an enemy was pouring cups of lemon juice over the open cuts. At this I woke up and after I awoke I could seem to continue to hear the screams."
"0434"	"I dreamed once again that I was driving my wife's automobile which I do, not infrequently. All of a sudden the auto began to spin crazily in circles, as one spins when skidding in snow. I was overcome with anxiety for I anticipated an accident. As much as I tried I could not control the auto nor could I see where we were going. The windows were frosted and therefore a view was not to be had. After I could hear the screeching of brakes and awaited the crash but nothing happrned. At length the auto stopped spinning and I again pursued my original course."
"0435"	"I was driving my wife's automobile down one of the more busy streets in Cleveland. What street it was I cannot tell although I am very familiar with the municipal thoroughfares of Cleveland. Snow blanketed the ground and the streets shone like glass. Suddenly the car went completely out of control and a dense fog appeared before my eyes through which I could see oncoming headlights but nothing else. Everything appeared to be gray and the car began turning complete circles as rapidly as a whirling dervish. Vainly I attempted to get the car under control but the more I tried the more the car spun. I began getting sick to my stomach and waited for an accident to occur but nothing happened. I heard horns blaring and people shouting but from whence they came I knew not. The car stopped spinning and I woke up happy to discover that it was only a dream."
"0436"	"I dreamt I was in the navy on liberty in Detroit, Michigan. I had a navy nurse as my date. We went drinking and had too much. I commented often that her uniform would get dirty if she didn't stop drinking. It seemed as a matter of fact that we ended up in her hotel room and were indulging in sex play. She kept seducing me on but never would quite submit to intercourse. After repeated attempts we went to bed together and indulged in intercourse. At that time the dream was terminated by a nocturnal emission."
"0437"	"I was seated at a card table playing poker with three other men. I was losing and felt that I should be winning. I had the impression that the game was unfair. In fact I was the only one losing. The other three men had lower cards than I did, but for some reason I was letting them take the money. They were kidding me about it and I was getting mad. On the next deal I showed everyone my cards, which were the highest on the table, but the other three men took the money and divided it among themselves. I once again showed them my cards and asked why I could not take the money. They gave no answer. I then picked up an ashtray from the table and started threatening them. In a fit of anger I threw it at a cat that suddenly appeared in the room. I hit the cat and felt relieved. The other three men excused themselves and left the room. I was looking for an answer as to how I could get my money back, but I never found one. The dream ended."
"0438"	"At the start of the dream I found myself in a large room filled with water. The water level reached to my hips. Suddenly I found myself wearing a pair of rubber hip boots and was overjoyed at the protection they offered. Other than the hip boots however, I was completely naked. I frantically tried to force open a door leading to another room and finally succeeded. The next room was also filled with water, but there were many hats floating on the surface. I then noticed hundreds of brown overcoats hanging on the walls above the level of the water. I wanted to get a dry one to put on, but every coat I came to was soaking wet. The same was true of every hat. After trying all the hats and coats and finding them all wet, I started to cry and that was as much of the dream as I remembered."
"0439"	"At the beginning of the dream I found myself working in a sawmill. I had the job of firing the furnaces. I can distinctly picture myself as I poured shovel after shovel of coal on the fire, but for some strange reason the furnace would not heat up. This continued until the foreman fired me for inefficiency. I explained to him that the furnace was at fault but he did not believe me. As an afterthought I woke up feeling very dismal and depressed."
"0440"	"At the beginning of the dream I was riding in an open cockpit airplane. The pilot was motioning to me to look down at the ground, but I was afraid to do so. This sequence was of long duration. After we had landed I ran from the plane and refused to speak to the pilot. I was told later that a plane had crashed and the pilot was signaling me to show it to me. That terminated my dream."
"0441"	"I was in a large darkened room and was in the process of dressing. On the bed there were civilian clothes and a Navy uniform. It seemed that I could not find the ones that I wanted which was complicated in that I didn't seem to really know what I wanted. Once I lighted a light but just for a brief flash because there were no shades on the windows. While the light flashed I noticed the uniform especially."
"0442"	"I was standing in line in a type of cafeteria. I was with a girl who seemed to be a combination of a girl who I like very much and another who I have seen at school but do not know but I do not like her (sentiment based only on appearance). She bought something and went into the next room which seemed to be the expected procedure. After some difficulty I ordered some pie and doughnuts and paid for a check which I was to use to obtain the food from the food counter. Instead they gave me the pie there and kept the check. When I passed the doughnuts I took two of them. When the waitress asked for my check the other explained that it was ok and I went to sit down."
"0443"	"I was in a barracks listening to a radio. It seemed that it was time to leave then almost immediately I was outside walking away from the barracks. I could still hear the radio and it seemed that there were other men around. They were complaining about being awakened by the radio too early. A short distance farther on there was a fellow on the sidewalk with a microphone. He was putting it away or getting it out but I don't know which and he didn't seem to either."
"0444"	"I was with another fellow, a friend of mine. It seemed that we were in occupied territory of some foreign power. It was night and we were near a railroad which at times seemed to be a canal. We were near a crossing of two RR or canals. At the crossing there were four fellows who appeared to be of the tall blond German type. They were throwing small gas bombs at people on the trains or canal boats. The people would die and fall off. After a while my friend and I seemed to be trapped by these same four fellows and were trying to figure a way of escape. Our plan seemed to depend on the capture of some small animal and we were going to attract it with some peanut butter that we put on a crack in the window beside the corner in which we were hidden."
"0445"	"I was in a small boat and thought that I was in the bay called Guanabara Bay on which Rio de Janeiro is located. The boat was accompanying a larger boat and seemed to have a work to do. But we on the little boat would ask those on the big boat if we might not have those of other little boats do the work for us whenever we met other little boats. Then the weather became too rough for us and we went into the landing. There we got on a truck and rode along the bay which seemed then to be Biscayne Bay at Miami, Florida. There were some other thoughts or actions in the dream that don't seem at all clear now."
"0446"	"In this dream I had murdered a girl I have known for some time. The actual killing however did not transpire in the dream, but my conscience lead me to believe that I did the deed. The girl's body was stuffed in a cardboard box which I stayed close to with a morbid fascination or fear of being discovered. In the next scene I was racing with another automobile to the one remining space in a parking lot. I succeeded in reaching the space first and was greatly satisfied. The third and last scene returned to the body in the cardboard box. Although I was positive that I was the perpetrator it turned out that another man confessed to the murder. Upon hearing this I was relieved and my guilt feelings absolved."
"0447"	"The setting of this dream was in a woods on a late summer afternoon. I was walking down a path through the trees seemingly as I recollect, with some sort of problem on my mind. As I was walking along I gradually became aware of a scantily clad girl walking a short distance ahead of me. As I was looking up at her with some degree of surprise at her attire she turned around and smiled at me and began running on ahead. I started to give chase running faster and faster but never quite catching up to her. The dream ended with this little game of run and chase with an emission. The girl in this dream is not recognizable although I remember that she had blond hair which may or may not be representative of an acquaintance."
"0448"	"In this dream I was crawling on all fours across a number of railroad tracks. As I scrambled over each successive pair of tracks I remember looking down the shiny rails and seeing locomotives approaching from a distance. I got across the five or six pairs of parallel rails unscathed and found myself walking on a bright steel platform. As I walked along, the steel sides of the ramp angled in until they joined in a small room. I entered the room and found that it was an elevator. I was vaguely conscious that there were several other people in the elevator besides myself. After our descent seemingly underground, I found myself a prisoner of soldiers who I took to be Germans by their uniforms and incoherent speech. I was marched down a long corridor and finally confined in a small room with a guard. The dream ended here."
"0449"	"In this dream I was going to the cobbler to pick up some repaired shoes. On my return home from the shop I cut through the playground of my grade school. The next thing I knew I was inside the school building, wandering through the empty rooms. I suddenly realized that I was being followed. The situation became quite tense. Three persons appeared coming toward me. I pulled a revolver from my pocket and shot them. In the following scene I had been captured by the police and I seemed to be very much relieved over my capture -- somewhat resigned to the fate in store for me."
"0450"	"This dream began in the university parking lot. On my way to class I ran into a member of the faculty and I remember our exchanging remarks about his new car. Following this I found myself aboard an airliner bound for Florida. Again in this scene was the same member of the faculty and likewise we exchange some remarks which I am unable to recall. The last scene of this dream transpired on the front porch of my house. From where I was sitting I saw a large airplane fly over my house and as it was flying along it fired several blasts releasing a cloud of black smoke each time. The plane landed on the street and as it landed it became a much smaller craft. A woman (age 30) a friend, got out. I asked her to take me up for a ride, but she refused because she had just paid $3000 for a new carburator. Dream ended at this point."
"0451"	"I was in a store such as a Burrows store and purchased four new bright blue desk tops. They were about 18 inches wide, 30 inches long and made of a thin plywood-like material. They had a piece attached on the back with a slab in it for their attachment to a stand, something like a music stand. I took them to class and gave three of them to other pupils, keeping one for myself. the teacher was a woman, 28, and is not only one of my instructors here at Reserve, but is also the young lady I have been dating quite a bit lately and am very fond of. For some reason or other I soon painted my desk top a duller color, pinkish brown. The teacher seemed to be quite pleased with the desks and so was I. I think some of the other students might have resented it."
"0452"	"I, age 20, was sitting at the breakfast nook table with my father, 54, and two other persons who I remember only very vaguely. They may have been my sister and one of her girlfriends, ages 19. I was supposed to be studying my German homework, but found myself reading and discussing an army handbook on field artillery. The front door bell rang and in came a fraternity brother of mine with a large double decker birthday cake. I asked why the cake and he said that he had received one the week before and now it was my turn. My dad asked him if he had been out to Eisely's place, meaning John Carroll U and he answered that he was applying to their med school (they have none) next week. My dad said that he had better hurry and he returned that he liked Reserve and Case better anyhow and that they were damn good schools."
"0453"	"I was driving down a street near home when one of my fraternity brothers, 20, hailed me and asked me if I were going to the Beta picnic. When I asked him where it was being held he said in Florida and that he wasn't going since it was so far. I said I thought I would drive down since I wanted to break in my new Ford convertible that I was driving. I told him I was going to get three other guys and drive down. The picnic was to be the very next day. I drove home and was looking the car over in the backyard when my dad, 54, appeared. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was going to drive down to Mentor. I then corrected myself and said I mean Florida. I told him I wanted to see how the car performed and I would find out what kind of mileage I was getting. My dad told me that if I wasn't getting good mileage, I should stop in any garage and they would put on a new carburetor free since they were guaranteed for good mileage."
"0454"	"I seemed to join up with a man who was starting a revolution. It was just to be a small thing and began in a little village. My friend was older, perhaps 40. We had other male followers also. As the revolution proceeded we became more powerful until we were sweeping the country and world. I was in charge of fueling our vehicles although I only had a few barrels of gas and oil. We had huge stores of war surplus weapons and a few new [illegible] . Our ace in the hole was a huge ape about 30 feet tall and very powerful. As we were transporting him to a new scene of battle his specially built truck went over a cliff and the ape broke loose and became uncontrollable. He chased another friend (a pal in real life, 20, who just now comes into the dream) and me. We began climbing a huge tree. My friend was tired and kept slipping. We finally got to the top but my friend slipped and fell to his apparent death below. I descended and with a few friends performed an operation on the ape and restored him to his former human form. He became our friend. He had been previously turned into this monster by someone we knew nothing of."
"0455"	"Myself, and four or five companions of the same age, all male, got out of our car at some place that was like Mentor Park. It was winter and the place was abandoned. Ice was all over the ground. We walked across an open area and as we passed through some passageway we found ourselves threading our way down a sunny mountain trail looking for gold. We noticed other groups coming after us. We finally came out into a great field with a jungle in the distance. We noticed small animals resembling pigs running around. As we got into the jungle proper which was very light and sunny we saw all sort of wildlife. Lions, giraffes, pythons, standing out most in my mind. For safety we decided to climb trees. I first climbed a small tree but found it was not safe enough so I came down and began to climb a large tent pole which I had not noticed before. As I did so I had a nocturnal emission and awoke."
"0456"	"I and several other people were in a large field. The only other person I recognized was a colored boy who was in my high school class six years ago. (I haven't seen him since.) All of a sudden he started to run from me and I threw a long metal rod at him and missed him. (It seems that at the time I was glad that I missed him.) The next moment I was on our third floor at home. I heard him coming up the stairs and I attempted to hide in a small closet. (There is really no small closet on our third floor.) However I didn't get hidden in time and he came right up to me and shook my hand and smiled."
"0457"	"I was walking up a highway going uphill. Just ahead of me I saw the father (age 50) of a childhood playmate of mine. He had a tank strapped to his back. From the tank ran a hose to the bottom part of a broom which he was sweeping the highway with. The water from the tank would come out of the hose just at the bristle of the broom so as he swept he also washed the highway. I took the contraption and started sweeping the highway. I couldn't understand why the highway could be dirty since it had rained two nights previously. Then I remembered that it had snowed the night previously. This seemed to explain to me why the highway was so dirty."
"0458"	"I was standing in front of a mirror in the hall of my home (my Akron home) combing my hair. Tremendous amounts came out and when I was through I was practically bald. It didn't bother me much at first and then I suddenly realized that this hair I had lost was lost for life. And there was nothing I could do to get it back. I was then ready to leave the house and I couldn't decide whether to wear a hat or not."
"0459"	"I was trying to get an injured dog to the hospital. To do this I had to carry him through a swamp. When I was going through the swamp there was a pack of wolves attacking me. As I remember it they were very small wolves, about the size of a small dog. These animals weren't ferocious, but only chewed at the boots that I had on."
"0460"	"I was visiting my undergraduate university. I had been walking around one of the main halls watching the students move from class to class. A boy told me that there were classes on the second floor and I could go up there and walk around if I wanted to. But I went outside and walked down the street. The small town had been built up a great deal since I had last been there."
"0461"	"I walked into a bar and had a drink with a friend I had just met. He was in the service with me and I actually hadn't seen him for a year or more. But in the dream I met him as I would if I had seen him every day. When I was talking to my friend another fellow walked up and my friend introduced me saying this third man was a friend of his. Number 3 invited us in the back room for a drink. When number 3 opened the door I saw the room was full of men, who were quite hard to see through the dim light and smoke. They immediately began to advance and my friend and I, backed against a wall, and began knocking them down. Number 3 also turned on us. I couldn't seem to be harmed but I knocked man after man down as they would approach. It ended here."
"0462"	"As the dream began I found myself walking down a street that resembled that of Wall Street in New York City. My clothes were torn and shabby and I resembled a typical bum. I was asking the men (very wealthy looking) for a handout when they walked out the door of this one building which I was standing in front of. When finally one man came out who resembled my father and threw me a coin which I missed, it rolled down the sidewalk and into a little stairway that led to the basement of one of the buildings. When I walked down the steps where the coin had rolled I saw the entire stairway was filled with coins and bills of all denominations. I then leaped into the huge pile of money at the foot of the stairs and began to let the coins and bills run through my hands. I seemed to enjoy the feeling of having the money cover my entire body. I then began to stack the bills and coins very neatly in one corner when my dream ended."
"0463"	"I was walking over an open field that had a low-lying mist about my feet. I was with a little baby girl about four years old. I was holding her one hand and I believe a woman was holding her left. She was a little vague. We came to a cliff and the baby tried to jump off of it but we held her hand and kept her from it. Then the scene was in an auditorium and we were walking across the stage when the child broke loose again and this time jumped from the stage and fell to the floor on her head. Then I saw a woman playing a piano and I knew it was this little girl's mother. How I don't know, but I knew I associated her with the little girl in this manner. Then the woman opened a drawer of a desk and the woman and a few others all had a very surprised expression on their face and it was one of shock and horror. I myself could not see what was in the drawer but knew it must be something very horrible. The woman reached in the drawer and very tenderly lifted out the 88 keys of the piano which were all tied together in one long string. They all began to weep. They then opened the second drawer (which I could not see what was in it either) and she took out the piano legs and strings. They then opened the third drawer and the mother tenderly lifted out the arms and legs and body of the little child I had been walking with. Each time they opened a drawer they would have this very startled expression on their face. The dream ended here."
"0464"	"I was in a schoolyard (the schoolyard of my 12th year). It was very sunny out in the yard. There were a great many students in the yard. They were not grade school pupils, but they were instead college students. I felt that it was Indiana University. I then went into the office as they handed me a class card. I then found myself in another room. This was a classroom and I found that I had signed for a course in typing and Dr. Harris of the philosophy dept. here at Reserve was the instructor. I asked him if he hadn't taught at Reserve and he said that he hadn't. While talking to him I was making side comments to the class. One that I can remember is that I said I'll bet I COULD pass this course if I played football. And they replied, ""Well, why don't you?"" Then they noticed how small I was and laughed. Here the dream ended."
"0465"	"I was walking down a street quite late at night. The street was very large and it was quite dark. I was walking with a girl who I did not recognize. Suddenly I heard gunfire (of heavy pieces). Then I heard the scream of rocket bombs and everything began to explode around us. We were the only ones on the street and we began to run as fast as we could. Finally we went into this house and up many flights of stairs till we came to the last floor and the very topmost room of the house. When I opened the door a bomb hit the room. The dream then ended."
"0466"	"This dream took place in a war surplus goods shop, one very much like the shop downtown. I was in the shop and had just won a contest which I thought entitled me to anything in the place. I went from counter to counter and picked out what I wanted, socks, gloves, etc. I remember very clearly that I picked out an army flying jacket. I had wanted a good leather jacket but they didn't have any. I had piled up a pretty large amount of merchandise and was about to leave when the clerk came over and told me that my prize amounted to only five dollars toward any purchase. I put most of the merchandise back where I had gotten it. At this point the dream ended."
"0467"	"I dreamt that I was out for a ride in my car. My girl and her sister were along. Betty's sister, Gladys, has a driver's license so I let her drive the car for a while. I remember that we got off the main road and were driving up and down hills on a side road. Gladys is a good driver and she wasn't breaking any laws. I remember this very distinctly. However, as we were going down one of the hills we were stopped by a police car. As we stopped I asked Gladys if she had her license with her. She said no and became rather angry. Instead of the cop coming up to me in the car, he just sat there in his and I had to go back to him. He wouldn't tell me what we had done wrong, but gave me a ticket anyway. The police car was a very odd affair, being gray, very long. As a matter of fact, it was more like a bus than a police car. After the police had driven off I began to think the situation over and it burned me up. I was about to go to the police station and demand an explanation when the dream ended."
"0468"	"I dreamt that I had entered a town which had just been taken over by a gang of criminals. Business was going on as usual, but everywhere there were people walking around with machine guns, etc. on their arms. I remember that I went to the barber shop to get a haircut. As I went in I noticed a man out in front who was collecting money, taxes or something of the sort. Everyone who came up to him paid him in coin and called him sir. The man's appearance (personal) was very obscure. I sat down, was conscious of someone alongside of me but couldn't tell who it was. As I was sitting there, a man came in the shop and looked in my direction. He said, ""I thought I saw a couple of faces back there."" As he came back to me I couldn't make out anything about him because of the haze. He put both hands on my face and said, ""You have a professional face."" Then his hands started towards my neck and I had the feeling that he was going to choke me. I took hold of both of his wrists and pushed him away."
"0469"	"I dreamt that I was someplace in the Orient with two friends visiting a small state which had just been taken over by a dictatorship. The rule was strictly by the military. The section I was in was undermined by huge caverns. It seems that all of the political prisoners, etc. were kept at work in these caves. My friends and I wanted to visit the caves and take a look around so we procured passes from the local chief. After we had seen enough we started to leave. I remember that we walked up a long tunnel. As we neared the guards my friends took out their passes and I reached for mine. It was gone. When I told this to the man at the gate, he looked at me sternly, called a huge subordinate and pointing to me, said, ""Take him below."" I became very alarmed, protesting that I was an American citizen. Finally, as a last resort, I showed my my war department AGO card. This convinced him and he turned me loose."
"0470"	"I dreamt that I was high up in a building. I remember it as being on the 21st story. It seems that the building was built in the shape of a square with a very large open center. While I was up there a battle suddenly developed in the open space inside the building. It was complex, even to the point of airplanes flying around, shooting at each other. I took part in the battle for a while, shooting at the airplanes which were flying around level with my position. While this was going on the enemy with foot soldiers took the first floor of the building. I realized that I was on the losing side and began looking for some means of making my escape. It was not clear in the dream, as to how I did it, but I remember sliding, as on a circular chute from floor to floor and finally to the first floor and out past my astonished would-be captors. At this point the dream ended."
"0471"	"My twin brother Seymour and I were among a large number of soldiers arriving at an Army airfield in Japan. Several other GIs were boarding planes for return to the United States. Both of us were very happy to learn that we were returning home tomorrow by air. Our group was divided into units of six men each. I was number 11; my brother number 12. The first unit left at 12 o'clock. Our group was to take off at 2 o'clock. Before leaving I told number 13 that he was unlucky as his unit wouldn't leave till the following day. Then my brother and I were in a small plane the pilot of which was Capt. Arnold (m, 26, an officer in our unit while I was in service). Though our group was supposed to be composed of six men; only my brother and I and the pilot were in the airplane. The three of us were in the pilot's cabin when Capt. Arnold went to the rear of the plane instructing me to take over the controls. That was the end of the dream."
"0472"	"My twin brother, my friend Mort, and I were going to the fraternity barn dance. I was driving as we were to call for the girls at 8:30. After picking up my date, we waited for a phone call from Mort. By 11:30 he had not called as my date, my brother and I drove out to the dance. Mort and his date were already there. We then drove back on a road with streetcar tracks. I left my brother at his date's house and went to my house to change clothes (for some unknown reason). While at my house, my date (age 19) and I were alone. We were waiting for my brother to call. I thought to myself that this was an opportune moment to make love to my date. Just then however, my mother and dad reutnred and I was trying to explain to them why my date and I were alone in our house."
"0473"	"I was playing catch with Al (my frat brother) on a paved highway. Suddenly a jeep pulled up behind me and an army captain was bawling me out for not saluting him. (I had suddenly become a sergeant.) The captain was in his twenties, but I do not recall his face. He was short and heavy set. He further chewed me out for not having my shirt buttoned. He told me I would have to pull extra guard duty for a week. The extra duty would only be from 7:30 to 8:30. Then I was strolling down Abington, towards a Mather class, and I (once again a civilian) remarked to myself that this was only a dream."
"0474"	"I was driving our car, a 1946 Pontiac, over route 42 toward Ashland, Ohio. The day was warm, and I had Bob (20, friend of mine who also worked with me on Sturdays) in the car with me. We were members of a baseball team which was to play Ohio University. As we turned towards Athens I remarked that the car was in fine shape. We arrived at Athens and then Bob remarked that he had to get back to Kent State University right away. While we were on the way the car broke down and I woke up."
"0475"	"I dreamt that my parents had purchased a house. We got into our car and went to see our new residence. The street was very beautiful and had many majestic trees. The house itself was very small, in fact it was only three rooms: a large front room and a small kitchen and bedroom. The house was wooden and didn't look very new. The most unusual feature however, was the fact that the house faced sideways. It was between two large houses. And when I saw our house I was very surprised and very keenly disappointed. I wondered how my folks could have purchased such a house."
"0476"	"In this dream I received a letter from my girl who is a young nurse two years younger than myself. I was reading her letter but could not make out any of her words. I turned to the last page and the words became clear. She had written that she has met another young man who was a young doctor and had fallen in love with him. She said she loved him because he was so sophisticateed and that all the young girls were crazy about him. She realized that this would surprise me, but that she hoped that I would not be hurt and that we could still be friends. I felt very hurt and angry and the more I thought of this the madder I got."
"0477"	"In this dream I dreamt we were walking in the suburbs of a large city which I recognzied to be Rocky River. The group consisted of four other youths about my own age. We were walking along the sidewalks laughing and talking although I can't recall any words I was saying. There is a bridge in Rocky River by the Westlake Hotel which I pass on my way home. In the dream we walked onto the approach to the bridge and prepared to cross over it. As we walked onto it, the others dropped back a little and I was all alone. Suddenly it began to hail and the others ran into a gas station to escape the very large stones that fell. I was caught on the bridge and was undecided which way to go as I was afraid I would be hurt by the stones. the others yelled at me that I would get hurt so I rushed back across the bridge and ducked into a small shed in which was the colored gas station attendant."
"0478"	"In this dream I dreamt that it was raining very hard and I was walking in the rain with another young man who I did not recognize. There was a road down which we were walking and which was lined with tall straight trees. The scene shifted and I was walking around a muddy cliff but the youth was still there. We were standing there in the mud and I saw a huge snake crawling in a crevass in the cliff. I told the youth with me and we walked to a car where I got a gun and a pocket full of bullets and began walking back to the cliff. One the way we went through a covered bridge and I began to fondle the rifle and the bullets in the pockets of my jacket. I began to load the rifle and to laugh. We got back to the cliff and I saw the snake again. I fired the rifle and it did not go off, but the snake suddenly seemed to split open."
"0479"	"In this dream I dreamt that I was walking along a path that was in a suburb and there was a river in the valley. I thought to myself I wish I had a fishing pole and I could go fishing. The scene shifted and I was wading along the river fishing with a flyrod. The river was very dirty and shallow where I was fishing and the bottom was very muddy and sticky. I saw how dirty the water was and decided that I would walk up the river and try to find deeper and cleaner water where I could fish. I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet. It was lightning very hard when we got into town. A man drove past in a blue Chevrolet coupe and yelled."
"0480"	"I dreamt that I was walking along a street when I suddenly realized I was in the army. I could hardly believe it when I realized that I was in the service. It did not seem to agitate me very much except that it surprised me. I thought to myself that since I was taken from college I should be an officer. I looked at my uniform and saw that it was a second lieutenant's suit. I became very pleased and began to whisper to a passerby that I was a bigshot. The passerby seemed to be shadowy and vague. I began to get hungry and I thought I would go up and eat with the general. I walked a little ways until I came to a white building and I went in. There was a fat man about 50 sitting in a chair (the general) and a sergeant about 30 was cooking breakfast. The sergeant looked just like a bartender that I know in my hometown. When I told them this they began to laugh."
"0481"	"I was upstairs in our house in my room. My cousin was with me. She was going to go downstairs. I didn't want her to go so I took hold of her wrist. She couldn't get away so she took a syringe and needle from her handbag and went about giving me an injection of some drug that would make me loosen my grasp. She is a nurse and knows about such things. After she gave me that shot I got weak and let go. I stood up and it seemed that I fell back on the bed after having passed out for a minute. Then I awoke."
"0482"	"I was standing on top of a deep ravine watching the construction of a railroad bridge. The workmen were putting down the track and were using an engine and several cars to do it. The engine was pulling the cars and also the track. It was about halfway across the bridge when one of the cars caught on the end of the track and the engine pulled track and all out too far. All went plunging down to the bottom of the ravine."
"0483"	"There was a new neighbor of ours staying in our house and he had my bedroom. In my bedroom I have an iron box with some valuables in it. The neighbor found the key and took some of the things out. Later I saw him put the key into his pocket. I got hold of him and he said that he and his brother would give the things back."
"0484"	"I was walking in the cemetery on my way home from a movie when I came upon a car parked on one of the drives where it was the darkest. It was at night. I knew cars went into the cemetery because the fellow and girl wish to have sexual intercourse. I have found a kleenex and condoms on the ground. In knowing what the two were doing I had a seminal emission."
"0485"	"I dreamed that two people I didn't know and myself went to a house of a prostitute. I knocked on the door and a man came. He turned us away, but I knocked again and he let us in. I went to a room and found a girl naked and washing her genital organs. I could smell a sweet perfume. I took my clothes off and she got on the bed and spread her legs apart. My penis was erect and I put it into her vagina, but I couldn't get it all the way in. I took hold of her organs and pulled them a little to get my organ in. I did not have an emission. Some people came and I tried to hide my head."
"0486"	"My mother was sitting on the sofa reading the paper. My father came up tenderly and kissed her. She joked about his youthful flirtations, since they were both advancing in middle age. He continued flirting. He hinted in subtle words that they weren't getting any younger. That she should come upstairs with him so that they could engage in intercourse for one glorious last time."
"0487"	"I was talking to my ex steady girlfriend. We were reminiscing. I said I had to leave soon. She acted sorry. I asked her what her plans for the summer were. She told me she would join the circus. She said her knowlege of Hebrew had come in handy in getting the job. She asked me about my schoolwork and on parting smiled, saying, ""You'll do all right."""
"0488"	"I have a date with a girl. She is the ticket taker at a movie house and I have admired her frequently (in reality). Now we are at a picnic place by the sea. She feels a bit out of place. We are in a Jewish crowd and she is the only Christian girl there. Besides everyone thinks she is a whore which I am both suspicious and hopeful of. I notice that she is ill at ease and we walk away and go to a platform from which we watch the sea. I have clasped her hand and I am overcome with tenderness for her. (I think she is wearing her usher's uniform. During the dream I noticed that she was flat-breasted.) We admire with poetic sensitivity, the sea. I ask her whether I might kiss her. She said she did not mind but told me she was incapable of passion. I did not mind too much."
"0489"	"I was in a living room of some house at a zionist meeting. We were having a buffet supper. In the dining room a table was laden with food. A girl I know (she is a zionist organizer) was helping herself to food. She had the kind of dress on that had big armholes. At a slant one could look into see the beginning of the breast contour. I did. Suddenly she seemed to be stripped to the waist. She had small pointed breasts and I thought of her fiance sucking the nipples. I thought if he can do it so can I."
"0490"	"I dreamed that it was early in the morning just before my father left for work. I was sitting at the breakfast table half-sleeping and he yelled at me for being out so late the last night. I yelled back. From there we talked about school and he said he objected to my taking such useless courses as philosophy. I got very angry and screamed back at him, asserting my rights. My mother told me fearfully that I should not excite him, but I did not care. He had already gotten a pressure on his heart and had to take a pill for it."
"0491"	"I dreamt that I met a girl that I had known about seven years ago when I was in high school. I happened to be iwth a friend of mine who is of recent times and had no association with the girl at any time. The three of us drove all over and I never seemed to get anywhere, but we were always driving. I remember it was raining and the three of us would stop and walk a while. The three of us all were on the approximate same age. I remember the girl was rather scantily clad. The main determining thing about the dream was that the girl was far more attractive in the dream than in real life, particularly her legs. We seemed to be getting nowhere. The dream more or less fizzled without anything happening but us walking and driving in the rain."
"0492"	"I dreamed that I was at a large party with quite a few friends. We had been at a wedding and then came to this party which was presumably a reception. I was having a very wonderful time when all of a sudden I remembered that I had a date with a girl. I was supposed to pick her up at 8:30 and it was 11:30 by that time. I was quite worried and rushed home. I was going to call the girl, but as I thought the matter over I was quite worried. I didn't know what to do. I remember my father was very mad at me. I kept trying to figure a way out of the problem, but I couldn't. I woke up in the morning very much worried until I realized it was a dream."
"0493"	"I was walking in the country and came to a farmhouse. I asked the lady of the house if I could shovel the snow for $5. She hired me and after working for a while, I was invited for dinner. I remember it was quite unpleasant and the lady of the house seemed rather displeased with me. The food seemed quite delicious, but I was very worried. All of a sudden there were quite a few people that came in and they seemed very unsocial. The lady of the house warmed up to me when they came in and the meal became quite pleasant."
"0494"	"I dreamt that I was in some Oriental country and that I was going to an Indian church. I had seemingly been to the church before and was rather scared as I had caused a disturbance and been beaten up. There were quite a few other church groups, but I chose this one. I was sure that I would get into trouble, but a friend of mine went along. He got along quite famously with the leader but I seemed to have trouble. There was quite a bit of feeling towards me. I finally left. I thought I would be in trouble, but my friend pacified the crowd. We went on our way."
"0495"	"In this dream I was in a beer joint in Shaker Heights with the girl I go with. We were both drinking quite a few beers when all of a sudden I felt terribly ill. I went outside to vomit. She came along and was very sorry and helpful. We decided to go to another place and we were drinking liquor. I drank quite a bit. She kept saying I'd get sick, but I was determined to prove to her that I could drink more than she could. I got sick again under the same circumstances. We had quite a time and decided to go home. She wanted to go right home, but I wanted to make violent love. We had an argument about it. She said we couldn't if I was going to get sick everytime we drank beer. I felt ashamed and decided to quit drinking. She told me that wasn't necessary."
"0496"	"My girlfriend and I were sitting on a couch in her house. Suddenly my girl pulled a gun from my pocket and handed it to me. She begged me to shoot her. I was mortified. I ran to the door but she ran after me. I knew that her only wish was for me to shoot her. I pulled the trigger and then I began to laugh."
"0497"	"I dreamt that I went swimming in a deep pool that was not familiar to me. I took all my clothes off and put them on the bank. I began swimming. When I finished I got out of the pool. I began looking for my clothes but I couldn't find them. Suddenly I saw a girl holding the clothes and beckoning me to come with her. She began running and I ran after her. She put my clothes in a cave and disappeared."
"0498"	"I was sitting on a throne of gold surrounded by beautiful girls. The girls kept pawing me and I kept chasing them away. Suddenly one girl stood up and came close to me. I was surprised by her good looks. She bent down and kissed me. I felt thrilled. I put my arms around her and picked her up. We danced for a while. I was taken by her beauty. She was a most beautiful creature. I went wherever she went. I received a thrill every time she touched me. I wanted her badly. The next, I believe we were both floating in the clouds completely nude. We were pleasantly talking and laughing. We were dancing and singing suddenly, extremely happy. I continually kissed the girl, and she reciprocated. We stood arm in arm rolling on."
"0499"	"I was driving on an open road. I was speeding. My foot was down hard on the accelerator. Suddenly I saw a beautiful girl waiting at the edge of a road for a lift. I tried to stop the car but my foot couldn't find the brake. I frantically looked for the brakes but they had disappeared. Suddenly in front of me on the road was my girl. I wanted to stop the car and suddenly the brakes were in their proper places and I stopped."
"0500"	"I was standing near the bank of a river. The surroundings were dark and suspicious and I was afraid. I suddenly felt myself falling into space without even coming to a halt. Suddenly I plunged into the icy cold water. I could not swim. I cried for help. I heard someone calling and coming toward me. He began laughing at me. I looked at him. He was an old schoolmate of mine whom I detested. He laughed again and said he would let me drown. I screamed and as rapidly as I screamed he laughed. I felt myself drowning but he wouldn't help me. Then the scene became blank. I plunged into darkness fighting for breath. I was afraid. I felt a pressure against me. I wanted help but received only a little laugh. I could do nothing as the water pressed into me."
