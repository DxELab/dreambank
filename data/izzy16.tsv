"1031"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) This dude, girl and I were on a boat. We had to go fast somewhere and we all had to hold on tight to each other. We did this a second time and the girl was dying, but sometimes she was Spaceman. He kept trying to escape. We ended up at this hospital which looked more like a hotel. It was now a girl again, and her parents came. Her father brought wire to strangle her. I took it off of him. I was upset because she was dying and I was thinking about Vivian for some reason."
"1032"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) These two guys were joined at the hip. There was a knife stuck through the middle of one of them, I think. I had to pull it out, but if I did, it would probably kill one of them."
"1033"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) I was in a toilet. I heard Ezra's friends outside and I tried to hide but couldn't, so I walked out and screamed at them, but at the same time they screamed at me."
"1034"	"(2007-01-25 (16)) I was putting heaps of blankets on my bed. Tigger was there. I saw Tinkerbell. I told Mom and Ezra that Tigger was seeing Tinkerbell. She said ""Has anyone else seen Tinkerbell?"" and I said that I had."
"1035"	"(2007-01-26 (16)) There was some teacher woman called Melissa and she had been in my Year 1 class. She was fat. I think something happened to a boat."
"1036"	"(2007-01-26 (16)) Ted Bundy had disappeared for some years. I went to some jail because I had to go do something quickly and I went to this room with people doing a test. The teacher came in and was annoyed that I was there, but then kicked out this guy who looked like John Cazale, and told me to sit the test. I said ok, but that I needed to go to the toilet. I found Ted and we left. John Cazale and company were hanging around outside somewhere. Some girl started abusing me and Ted. I said I was sorry for what happened to John, though I actually wasn't. They left and Ted was like ""What the hell?"" We were both trying to avoid him. We were then at a hotel. Ezra was there. Ted and I were sharing a bottom bunk. The bed was actually in the wall, but Ezra was taking the one on top. Ted put his arm around me and we were making out. We ended up having sex. All these people were watching through the windows. I closed the blinds, but they weren't really helpful."
"1037"	"(2007-01-27 (16)) Mom was telling Ezra and I stories. She was telling Ezra something and I heard ""Grabbage"". I asked her to repeat it because it was a teacher I had before (I was thinking about Mr Grabski). I told her and she was embarrassed (she'd had sex with him). I went to Plainfield. I had been there before and there were heaps of people from Brookland in the hall. I remember seeing Daryl and Dmitri. I met with some people outside. We had to go in groups and do sport things. I didn't have some $1000 contract that would allow me to participate. I told the leader teacher, who was Mr Grabski. I text Calvin to see if he remembered him. Calvin ended up at my house looking for something later. We had to put our bags in these lockers. Calvin went off in some group. Tiana went with me. I was going through a yearbook from 2004. Parvati and Eliska were there. The music video for Od-na came on and I said ""I love this song!"". Tiana went for a drive, then she came back. I then ended up lost somewhere with Dmitri and 'Mr Simon Grabbage'. I was following them. Then it was Runescape like, and I died somehow. I asked some random to get my stuff and then I text Dmitri. I was in some snowy place with 'Jupiter rocks'."
"1038"	"(2007-01-27 (16)) There was this weird animal which was made of rubbish. It was weird. Mom knew what it was, but wouldn't tell anyone. I was with Silas somewhere and there were benches."
"1039"	"(2007-01-29 (16)) I was in bed at Mom's. Ezra and Mom woke me up."
"1040"	"(2007-01-29 (16)) I was at Mom's, but it was different. Ezra, Mom, Darren and I were leaving and I saw someone run into the house. Mom went in and called the cops. The guy ran out and went near the old person's home, which was a shop and was hanging around there. He started shooting and I hid behind a tyre on the car. I lay down and pretended to be dead because he started running over. He put the gun on me and was looking for the bullet holes. It turned into a 'movie' and he realized I had none and I grabbed the gun and said (though not me) ""Blow on this!"" and shot him. Later, I was at home and Clayton was there. I asked if anyone else was alive. He said everyone was. I went down the hall and my room and Dad's room were dark. The lights wouldn't turn on. I saw shadows in my room moving. I said that I knew it was a dream. I closed my eyes wishing for Ted Bundy, but then I woke up (dream within a dream)."
"1041"	"(2007-01-29 (16)) I was watching Devil's Rejects. There were heaps of new characters. Otis and Baby were at this pub. Otis had a strong accent and I was thinking 'What? This sucks!'."
"1042"	"(2007-01-31 (16)) I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. I think Clayton was there. We were talking about movies and Ezra asked ""Which Scarface do you like better?"" and I was like ""What the hell?"". A movie was being made in this place. I was walking with some guy. People had tape all over the backs and stuff. I asked someone if that was where they were supposed to get shot. They ignored me. I was standing with these REALLY tall girls. There were two guys nearby and my friend said ""fat gay man""."
"1043"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) I was in a building and I was looking at my timetable for school and looking at the teachers that I had. The Wayans Brothers were listed. Tom Cruise and Kiefer Sutherland were the drama teachers. I think Eddie Murphy was there too. I was telling Mom about them all being actors. I was in some room and someone came running in trying to shut the door. Someone was after him trying to kill him. We all started running and we jumped through this 'screen'. We didn't know where to go. I ended up in this office area and Christopher Lloyd was there. Christopher was going to hide behind a desk and I squeezed in near him. He said something, but I all remember is ""shaved leg"". I pulled this curtain so that I couldn't be seen. Christopher ended up moving. I ended up at home and I was trying to find somewhere to hide. I couldn't fit anywhere and the person arrived. I rewound time. This whole thing had happened before, and it kept happening again and again and I couldn't stop it."
"1044"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) I was at this place near a lake. There was a bird in there. This girl was dying and she jumped in to save it. She said that we had to give it to her mother because she knew how to revive it. The bird kept 'biting' me."
"1045"	"(2007-02-01 (16)) Ezra was doing weird things in bed, and I thought he was 'touching himself'. I was at a shop with Mom. They had Simpson's stickers there (for the book) and Mom was going to buy me two packs. This lady said ""Only two?!"". A girl came in and ordered some food. She ordered bananas, gravy and cucumbers."
"1046"	"(2007-02-02 (16)) I was in Dad's room and there were lots of cats. There was a ginger one, a black one and two big blue ones. They had blue rectangle patterns. They acted and looked like dogs. I was friends with Hayden Christensen. I was then at a shop with Nana. I was allowed to get one thing. I found a book about Peter Paige and Nana said she knew him and used to flirt with him and I was like ""He's gay!"". Then, we were fishing and there was this duck or parrot. I was then on a bus with Calvin. I had this Star Wars sticker book. It was all cartoon-like though. Hayden Christensen got on the bus and I called him ""the dude who played the guy in Star Wars"". He was crying and upset. I went to talk to him."
"1047"	"(2007-02-03 (16)) I was at 'school' and I was on the computers. There was a long line of computers. A teacher was talking to Eugene. He said that he liked computers and the teacher said ""so does Izzy"". His friends were like ""You don't want that!"". Later, we had something else in common and they said ""You REALLY don't want that!"". I saw Mr Nixon and I was thinking 'What the hell is he doing here?'. He was married. Jeremiah took my computer when I got up."
"1048"	"(2007-02-03 (16)) I was in the games room and I got trapped behind this thing. Someone else was trapped somewhere close by. There was a blanket and a blow-up airplane. I got bored so pretended to be an airplane. Nana came eventually and got me out."
"1049"	"(2007-02-03 (16)) I was watching The Simpson's Movie and it was just a lot of flashbacks and was only short. It really sucked."

"1051"	"(2007-02-04 (16)) I went to 'school' without my hair straightened. I was playing this game where you pick up sticks in this jungle setting. I was trying to pick the same colours as some friend of mine, hoping we'd get put in a group together. I was then sitting down somewhere with Calvin. Other people were sitting down too. Thuy kept following me and kept giving me some of her ""cookie cake"", as she called it. I couldn't find my water bottle and Thuy went looking for it. There were holograms. Harlan was being a retard like usual. There were lockers and mine was 22 or 23? Mine was above Jack Nicholson's. I was counting the lockers in weird ways, but kept stuffing up. Ms Rodrigues was there, except she was Bailey (Grey's Anatomy). Harlan found out that I had Myspace and was like ""Why the hell do you have one?""."
"1052"	"(2007-02-04 (16)) I was at a house and it was dark. I was Clark Kent (Smallville, as in Tom Welling). I walked down some hall and there was a person there. It was actually a premonition and I was someone else (I wasn't Clark). Then, Clark was there and he said that he thought someone was here so he carefully walked down the hall, but they left. Mom and Darren were outside. Police came."
"1053"	"(2007-02-07 (16)) Dad and I watched a movie. There was a piece of paper on the back door to see if I had gone out the back. I had some medicine thing in the cupboard that was Michael Palin's or something. It was one year old and there was a ransom note. I was thinking 'Oh my God! I've killed him!'. There were photos of him being tortured. I was going to watch another movie with Dad which had Marlon Brando in it and was supposed to be really funny. I ended up watching the beginning of another movie."
"1054"	"(2007-02-07 (16)) Mom was trying to guess who I liked. She had Eugene, Daryl, Calvin and Orlando Bloom written down. She found out that I liked dark hair and so she crossed off Calvin. She had already crossed off Eugene. I noticed that Dmitri wasn't listed."
"1055"	"(2007-02-10 (16)) I went on Flyff and was killing stuff without Clayton. It was too hard and I was saying to Ezra ""I need Clayton!""."

"1061"	"(2007-02-11 (16)) Mom and Darren picked me and Ezra up in Darren's car. We went to this big house. Darren went off into this dark part outside. I went to my room. The 217 lady (The Shining remake) was in my bed. I was trying to scream, but couldn't and she started getting up. I found Mom and she went to my room and nothing was there, but the sheets were messed up. I peeked in later and she was there again. I looked there again later and there was another girl in there and she had burnt legs. Mom saw her. She woke up eventually. Then I turned into her and I was naked. I ran to Mom and Ezra holding and hiding my genitalia. I was skinny, but had a little tummy and I was like 'It's nice being skinny'. This girl had been gone for 25 years. She had been anorexic but then had gotten fatter. I was then at school and I sat at the bench. I was wearing a shirt of Dad's. Ezra was putting stickers on it and I was saying ""I always have dreams about the 217 lady""."
"1062"	"(2007-02-13 (16)) I was at Mom's. She did my hair etc. Then I went home. I was playing with these hair dyes. There was a purple one and I was taking pictures. I realized I needed to wash hair and I called Mom and she got me and Ezra. We went to this caravan which was next to Samantha's house. There were Christmas presents there which Dad had got. He had got me three puzzles. Then we were at Mom's house. I put on my Spongebob shirt instead of my school shirt by mistake. We went to McDonald's for breakfast and Ezra was like ""Not again!"".

I told him to get lost and that I couldn't stand ""looking at his ugly head"". He kept following me. He said he liked me and I was absolutely disgusted. He offered me a lift and I refused. I couldn't work out how to get out of the shop."
"1075"	"(2007-02-16 (16)) I was at Mom's and some dude sent us some money and something else. He was promoting a school that he created.

Mr Reilly was saying something about the end of the year and that he looked forward to $7200. There were rides at this place and Charlene was there. Then I was at this place.

I was upset because I wasted most of my life at school and was annoyed that I was never going to do anything. I was then at Mom's. Some band was playing nearby. Margarita was outside and I slammed the door in her face. Later she tried to hurt me through the cat door. I was friends with some of the band. Then I was someone else.

"1108"	"(2007-03-07 (16)) I went to this private school in Russia so that I could steal some uniforms. I had to get two lots, one for me and one for Ezra. Mom was there. There was a stain on a pair of the pants I took. I went back there later to speak to the principal and he didn't catch on."
"1109"	"(2007-03-07 (16)) Mom crashed into this light and then she turned into Dad. Police didn't something. There was something about a jumper. I pretended to something."
"1110"	"(2007-03-07 (16)) I was at Mom's house and there were all these black people. Ezra was there. I decided I didn't want to stay there anymore."
"1111"	"(2007-03-07 (16)) I was at a shop and I think I worked there. I kneeled over some glass. I got glass in my knee and it really hurt. I had to squeeze it out. I asked for tweezers and a dust pan brush but we couldn't find any."
"1112"	"(2007-03-08 (16)) I was at Nana's. Then it was home. Dad was there. I wanted Mom to pick me up."
"1113"	"(2007-03-09 (16)) I remember Eugene, but I don't remember anything else."
"1114"	"(2007-03-10 (16)) I made a movie called 'Requiem'. Ezra, Mom, some dude and I were watching it."
"1115"	"(2007-03-10 (16)) I was at some place and some of it was on fire. I asked Mom for a car, but we couldn't call out. She let me use the pickup. I was then in this building and Eugene and Darius were walking up these stairs. Eugene was wearing a Spongebob shirt. I escaped through the roof. This building hadn't been destroyed yet. Ezra and his friends started chasing me. I went to a canteen and it was closed. I asked for water, but they only had this can one which was yuck so I asked for chocolate, but I ended up with one of those things you hang your keys on."
"1116"	"(2007-03-10 (16)) I was in a classroom, which I think was my English classroom. This teacher asked if anyone went to the Little Britain thing last night. I said ""I went there!"". No-one else put their hand up and I noticed that Eugene didn't."
"1117"	"(2007-03-11 (16)) Something happened and there were only a few people left alive in the world. Ezra and I were living in this little hut thing inside a chicken pen. We met with this black guy called Tyson. He had a motorbike. We were trying to save chocolates because they ""might be worth a lot soon"". I was going to text Calvin."
"1118"	"(2007-03-12 (16)) Calvin and I were in some place that had high buildings. They had different names for different heights. I wanted to go the '10 million' one. But Calvin wanted to go to the '12 million' one. We used a tray to float down. When we were up there I said ""This is too high!"". There was this room and these apples were coming through the window and the door and they were getting bigger and filling up the room. It showed them coming through one at a time, so it was jerky looking."
"1119"	"(2007-03-12 (16)) I went out the back with Dad and Vivian. I was talking and then I realized that they were preoccupied so I looked over and noticed that they were reading my diary. One entry said 'Dmitri is very hot!'. At the start of the diary I had written stuff about Daryl. Dewey was there too, but his last name was spelt 'Kirchs' but had Kirsch next to it. I looked away and looked again to check if it was a dream but it didn't change. I got up and ran inside. That Japanese guy from Alias was there. Then we were outside again and he was chopping us up. I said ""I'd rather do that [getting chopped up] than face people now!"". I was then at Mom's and she had a coconut roll. Darren knew about what had happened with the diary."
"1120"	"(2007-03-13 (16)) We went to Little Britain again. Someone was talking about some bra. It was completely different. David Walliams was talking to some guy. He went on the stage and had to blow his nose and get rid of this thing. He was then talking about something boring and was taking forever. Dad complained and Ezra asked why it was taking so long."
"1121"	"(2007-03-13 (16)) Dad went to this guy's house. Scarlett Johannson and some girl lived there. He was getting drugs."
"1122"	"(2007-03-13 (16)) I decided to have my day off and then Ezra wanted to stay home too. Dad was annoyed."
"1123"	"(2007-03-14 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I were at the bench. Alessandra sat down and I rolled my eyes and said ""Oh, great""."
"1124"	"(2007-03-15 (16)) I was somewhere with Clayton and Ezra and Nicolas came by later too. There was this really nice ice-cream. We were eating heaps of it, but were also throwing heaps out. While we were eating, I was talking. I ran out of stuff to say and ran out of ice-cream. Mom and Darren were there."
"1125"	"(2007-03-15 (16)) I was at this shop. There were lots of lollies there. Seamus was there and he opened this thing and all these lollies spilled out. I was at the counter and Elijah was miming what the dude behind the counter was saying. I kept saying ""Shut up Shiggan!"". Silas and some people were in a pool. I was trying to get around and I thought I had my period."
"1126"	"(2007-03-15 (16)) I had English, but it turned into Accounting. I was in the library. We were sitting inside the area when you first enter. Our bags were inside and Eugene's bag, which was empty, was on top of mine. I was trying to get a pen out of mine. Nick Frost was talking to us. He said that he'd be the first to admit that he ""fancied Jess"" (Jessica Stevenson). He went on to say how great she was. Everyone was like ""Whoa! Didn't see that one coming!"""
"1127"	"(2007-03-16 (16)) Ezra and I were wagging. Nicolas was hanging around. We had to run past Mr Norris etc. The next day, Dad found out we were wagging. Mom had been picking us up. The next day we went to this oval place which had a tennis court. Eugene came. He saw me and then left. We all had to run through these 'accordion' doors. There were these elevator things and moving blocks which we had to jump over. It was a big Phys Ed obstacle course. I ended up in this dark room which was mainly a big hole, but had platforms with beds on them. Mr Quinlan was watching over. Eugene fell down and Darius was trying to help him. I was reading his stuff and looking at baby pictures (though it was actually all about Rafe Spall) and it had his mothers name and stuff. Calvin text me to see if I was coming to school tomorrow."
"1128"	"(2007-03-16 (16)) I was talking to Daryl about Runescape. He was level 49 and I called him a noob and said ""Well you can't fish!"" and I said ""I'm level 64 fishing!""."

"1130"	"(2007-03-21 (16)) I had a job at the McDonald's at Tuart Hill. I had worked there already. I got a job at a better one that paid more and I could work less. I went to the McDonald's to buy a burger. I got my pay slip which had $180 on it. I got an ice-cream too. I was then at school. Autumn was there. Darius was stalking Eugene, Calvin and I."
"1131"	"(2007-03-21 (16)) I went to France and some other place. I also went to the UK for a few minutes. There was a ship accident."
"1132"	"(2007-03-22 (16)) I was at school and I had one of the science classes. There was a new girl and she said ""I am awesome and have huge melons!"". Everyone was like ""ew"". There was a relief teacher and they asked me if I liked Nathan Nelson (I was thinking it was a cross between Dmitri and Seamus). I asked ""who?"". On the roll, there were dots for people the teacher thought liked each other. Mr Reilly had put me and Daryl together. I had asked a teacher for a yearbook a while ago as we didn't get one for Year 10 or 11 (I was Year 12). Eugene was in the class. Calvin and Sabrina were together on the roll. I tripped over this wall. My leg was twitching and Jeremiah was looking at it. Daryl invited me to his house and I went there. He gave me this farm-y looking shirt [Clark Kent like] . They had a big house. There were ghosts there. They had all these Pokemon pictures around. There was going to be a party there. There were photos of Daryl and he had a piercing and I was like ""ew"". Daryl tried to get me to drink and I refused. His mother said that he just quit smoking. I told Ezra about the dots but he already knew. I was trying to tell Mom that I didn't like him."
"1133"	"(2007-03-22 (16)) I was somewhere that I've never seen before (though I knew where I was in the dream). Poppa was working on a building. I had an 'epiphany' of that popcorn cartoon. I found this pyramid. It had this thing out the front which was mine. I went in and it was all my stuff. There was a tape in the video player. I pressed play and it was this Simpson's cartoon. Then another cartoon came on and I recognized the bear from the popcorn cartoon so I rewound it and it was it. It was only half cartoon and there was no popcorn music. Autumn was the bear and she was climbing through that pipe. I was thinking 'No way!'. We were on an island."
"1134"	"(2007-03-24 (16)) Calvin and I were talking next to the sports shed thing on the oval near North Midvale. The bars were stretchy, like rubber. Calvin put his arm through and grabbed a ball and let it bounce off the bars and back in. Teacher-M-06 told us off, although he hadn't seen the ball. He took all of this stuff of mine including my pillow, bag, TV and DVD player and put it into the shed. Dad was driving us away and I realized my phone was in there. Teacher-M-06 and Mr Willingham wouldn't let me in to get it. Autumn was there and we were arguing about getting my stuff back. She left so she couldn't say that I'd done anything. I grabbed my bag and pillow and left. Eugene was near our car and I saw Daryl in his car. Something he'd done earlier confirmed that he was gay. Ezra and Farrah were in the car. I saw Barry Pepper outside the car and I told Dad that that was ""the guy who looks like Tigger!"". Dad was laughing and Barry was like ""what?"". Dad said ""You have to ask my daughter"". I kept laughing every time I looked at him and I couldn't tell him. His friends were laughing and waving about. Debra Messing was on the oval and her friend was trying to make her meet guys. All of these 'college' guys started pouring out of North Midvale. Then a bunch of kids came. There was a crazy lady there and she said ""I don't care which one; I just want one that's pretty"". She caught this boy and was going to make her sister care for him so that he turned out like her. She was picking out clothes and he ran into the shed and she was like ""Meh, that's where I'm going next""."
"1135"	"(2007-03-24 (16)) I was at school and there was a long row of chairs and Calvin and I were sitting next to each other. Calvin told Darius to move ""over there"" and Calvin pointed next to Evelyn. We kept looking over and laughing. Evelyn said that she liked ""this guy"". Calvin asked her if she thought Darius was hot. She was like ""I don't know"". Then she whispered ""I think he's hot!""."
"1136"	"(2007-03-25 (16)) I was Clark Kent and Ezra was a fake Clark Kent (we looked like Tom Welling). Sometimes, they weren't us. They went to a bowling alley and were messing around. There was a shed place. A dog and a lion were separated by a ""one and one tenth"" year old dog. They wouldn't move while the dog was there."
"1137"	"(2007-03-25 (16)) Lionel Luthor (Smallville) heard about this jealousy thing and swapping partners. He said he tried it out and he was masturbating and then he was with a dog."
"1138"	"(2007-03-25 (16)) I was at school. I was walking down some stairs and Eugene was there."
"1139"	"(2007-03-25 (16)) I was watching Smallville. It was in the early 1900's. There was a book written in 1840 about 1920. Clark Kent was born around 1900. He tried to throw this statue of George Washington through a window, but it landed right in front of him. The statue wouldn't go through until something had happened."
"1140"	"(2007-03-26 (16)) I was watching Smallville. I was somewhere talking to Lex. He was thinking that Lana didn't seem that great anymore."
"1141"	"(2007-03-26 (16)) I was at school in this room. There were medals and stuff on this table. Eugene's wasn't there so I figured he took it, so I took mine. They were for Accounting."
"1142"	"(2007-03-27 (16)) I was at home. People kept breaking in all the time. Mom said that we (Ezra, Valerie and kids and I) should leave the back door open. This guy came and attacked us. Mom came and stopped him. He had stuff of ours in his car. Kevin Heffernan was there, but he hadn't taken anything and we let him go but then stopped him again. He had my toy box in his boot."
"1143"	"(2007-03-27 (16)) I was in a forest. There were cars that didn't work well. Autumn was there. I had the pickup but I couldn't drive it. I needed to get somewhere. There was a swimming competition on and Calvin was there and his cousin, Acquaintance-F-02, was in it. Ezra was there and he had a cool jacket and these guys were like ""Whoa, awesome"" but it had a teddy bear picture on the inside, so Mom put it on weird so it couldn't be seen."
"1144"	"(2007-03-28 (16)) There were these fork/butterfly things which you breathed into and it erased your memory for a while until you breathe into it again. You could also 'explore'. I went behind my wall and there were all these pictures of guys.  I went down this hallway. I found a door to Tiana's room. I went in and was talking to her boyfriend on the phone and invited him over. I was then at school and Calvin and Madelyn left for a minute. These retards were sitting near me. This lady came up and thought I was a sad loner. She was asking me these questions about being sad and lonely and I was like ""I'm fine, what the hell?"" Then Calvin and Madelyn came back."
"1145"	"(2007-03-29 (16)) Darius and Eugene were laughing. Calvin was there and we said something about Evelyn. Ezra and I were walking home, but I forgot Ezra. I called Mom. This guy was opening his door and I was thinking 'nambla!""."
"1146"	"(2007-03-29 (16)) Ezra, Mom and I ended up stuck on this island. I was in 'work' clothes. We were staying with this guy who was my age. He got this report card and gave me something that was mine. I gave something to him instead of his mother. He put the report somewhere and pulled out another which had A's and B's. He was in the same year as me. There was this 'town boogeyman'. He had vines in his yard that would swing down. People were lying on the floor and we had to wait for hours to be let out of this cage thing. Some people got trapped in a section of the yard which was surrounded with chicken wire. He got our laptops. They were outside his house. Ezra ran off and I was about to, but I went to the door and asked for him. He got a gun and I thanked him."
"1147"	"(2007-03-31 (16)) I was watching this dating show. People kept going to the Titanic. These bodies would always float up. I was complaining to Dad about it. This lady on the show decided on a date with a dog instead of this guy. That white thing from The Neverending Story was on this bridge that looked like the one in a level in Crash Bandicoot: Warped."
"1148"	"(2007-03-31 (16)) I was watching this movie that James Spader was in. It was like Secretary."
"1149"	"(2007-04-01 (16)) A nuclear bomb was going to go off. I found this trapdoor and some people and I went down. The place ended up full of people. It was mostly closed off, but one side faced this field and the other walls had spaces at the top. Some people were trying to get in from outside. This helicopter was spraying water in for us. There was an envelope on this desk which had photos of kids with their fathers. There was something with James Spader and Nathan Page."
"1150"	"(2007-04-01 (16)) I was at home and I put my That's Life! answers into an envelope but then I realized that I hadn't done the puzzles yet. Dad called me an idiot."
"1151"	"(2007-04-02 (16)) I was at school and we were getting ready for graduation photos. I was in this room that I'd never seen before and it had 'steps' with chairs on them. I saw Tiana there. Everyone was sitting in different groups and I was by myself. Tiana's group was called out first and I followed since I was nearby. I sat next to her and she wanted Eliska to sit there, but she didn't tell me to move. I thought Eliska was Alessandra at first. Daryl was in the same group. I saw Eugene and did a reality check but it didn't work."
"1152"	"(2007-04-02 (16)) Calvin wanted to go to Hawaii and I was like ""Hawaii's gay""."
"1153"	"(2007-04-03 (16)) I was in a room somewhere and I asked Ezra to pick the best looking guy out of a list of people. The list included Simon Pegg, Mark Heap, Nick Frost and Dylan Moran. I said I thought Dylan Moran was. There was a video playing with Mark Heap in it and Ezra said ""I hate that guy!"". The movie was old but James Spader was in it and I had downloaded it, but I didn't know that he was in it. I was at home and Dad was hanging out with Amanda Bynes."
"1154"	"(2007-04-03 (16)) We were at this weird place somewhere. I think we were outside. Mr Stevenson was showing us flowers. If we guess what it was, we got a prize. Almost everyone got a prize for the first one. I got the second one. Seamus was there and I said ""Shut up Shiggan!"" and he almost fell over."
"1155"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) We had an excursion and were at this amusement park. We were sleeping and Calvin put something of Eugene's on top of me. Elijah and Seamus got me to sign this branch thing. Adelynn found all these 'smelly' things. I could smell all of these things with my mouth open. One of the things was really stinky, but I was too excited that I could smell it and I didn't care. This dog had to find these two cookies (by smelling). He found them and ate them. Then I was at this place with a bunch of other people. Adelynn asked ""Who 'did' A Clockwork Orange?"". Elijah put his hand up, so I did. A bus came. I had stuff hanging off the edge of this 'ledge' (it had logs across it). This girl pushed my stuff off so I picked her up and threw her off, but she was ok. Eugene came to do whatever the activity was with the branch, but all the spots had been taken. I wasn't allowed to eat McDonald's. Dad talked to Tiana on MSN and they talked about Spongebob."
"1156"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) Mom was going to a wedding. I found out that it was Genevieve's wedding, except her last name was 'Ocean'. She was getting married to Classmate-M-26."
"1157"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) I was taking photos of Eugene and Darius. They got attacked by something. Then they were chasing me. When we finished, we ended up at this room with containers and jars. Then we were on grass and were friendly with each other. I was trying to get Eugene to eat the dirt and he did. Someone said something about ""bubbly two something"", but it sounded like they said another number first. Eugene asked ""How can you have bubbly two something?"" We were giggling about it. I can't read or remember what it was, but when I read it, I think it was either peas or pillows, or maybe neither."
"1158"	"(2007-04-04 (16)) I was watching the first episode of Sister Sister with Ezra. The 'new' twin was changing the house around. The 'Dad' (all the characters weren't the real ones) was a principal. The new twin told him to chuck a party at the house. The old twin was saying how big her mother's bed was. Then we were playing a game in this dark room. We had to catch the bad guy. Then it was real and someone said that the ""killer was already inside"". Later, Ezra and I were playing. He caught me, but he thought I was Nicolas."
"1159"	"(2007-04-05 (16)) There was some competition with fish. You got turned into a something. I solved the puzzle and there was a cut on a fish? Ezra solved it too. For some reason, he swapped our fish heads around and I was trying to get the right ones back. This guy was burying his head. We were like ""What the hell?""."
"1160"	"(2007-04-05 (16)) We were in the car and we parked in this 'extra' carpark at Science Museum. Nana was with us. Margarita told someone that I was fat and I said ""At least I'm not fat and ugly like you"". The Science Museum was across the road. Then I was there with Mom, Ezra and Darren. We had these cards which allowed us to buy stuff. It wasn't the Science Museum though; it was just this gigantic shop. They had some cool clothes and I found some gloves. Then I had no pants on. Mom signed under my name for the card. I wanted to do it though. There was this cool skeleton outfit. I was trying to decide what to buy. I was calling out across the shop. I found these school bags and one had lots of pockets. There were also these REALLY big bags. I was looking for a wallet. I found these people who did something and they were evil or something. I was in some section and this said that I wasn't allowed there. They were calling for me over the speaker, so I got out. Tim Brunero was there and he said that I was ""allowed anything"" from outside the shop. They were packing it away and then he turned into Mandy Patinkin. There was a cool jumper and a cool raincoat thing. Mandy put on the jumper and I was like ""Yeah, I want that one!"". It was blue and completely different from the one I wanted but I thought it was red. So I found a blue one in my size. My name had already been put down for it and I was like 'How did that happen?'. Then I was back in the shop. There were Easter eggs. Dad carried me through this tunnel. I told him to ask the manager at McDonald's for my Easter egg. The manager looked like Joseph Cotten."
"1161"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) I was at a rich person's house, at which there was a party. There was a gate out the front and I saw Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald and James Spader walking up to it; they all looked how they did in Pretty in Pink. James Spader was wearing that light blue suit thing. I wasn't even paying attention to the other two. I decided I was dreaming. James Spader smiled and I was thinking for the gate to be gone as I reached for him and then it was. I grabbed him and started making out with him. James had his arms around me, while we were still making out and then we ran into the house. He was looking around for something and said ""Where's that fuck-in?"" I said ""What's a fuck-in?"" and I thought 'Oh my God, I just swore! Oh, doesn't matter it's only a dream'. He said ""That thing that you fuck in,"" I said quietly ""That thing you fuck in"". Then I lost lucidity. Then we were some other guy and some other girl and the guy liked this other girl, but decided to have sex with that girl anyway. They ran off and were in this tent inside. This lady saw them and asked ""What are you doing?"" and he said ""Yoga""."
"1162"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) Ezra, Clayton and I left home to find Mom. It was really dark. We got up the street but then decided that we should go back. It was then pitch black, literally -- there was no light whatsoever. We were confused. We edged our way back and started running whenever a car drove past (for the headlights). Eventually, we made it back home. I thought 'Now Mom will come and it will be all Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It was. Mom was going to go meet Leslie. I was having trouble locking the front door. The wood door wouldn't close or lock. I then thought that it must be a dream and I managed to lock it. The power went out a few times and there was a door at the top of the stairs (it looked like Mom's house on the inside). I was then somewhere typing my password for my email and it was showing. I was hitting the right keys, but it was all wrong. I asked Mom to read out what I typed and I figured that it was a dream again."
"1163"	"(2007-04-06 (16)) I was at some place with the school. They were talking about who would make a good couple. The teachers thought that Eugene and I would. There was something about werewolves. Later, there was a list of 'who likes who'. It had Rafe Spall with 'Lauren Sarah Broughan' or something. It had Jerry O'Connell with Mad Max II. There were Pokemon cages? This stone, which was a kind of light, was lit when you put a piece of paper underneath it and it would be used as a projector. I tried it and it didn't work. I found this water and I realized that it couldn't be seen through the water. Some guy asked for the list. I saw Eugene nearby and then I heard this guy who sounded like Dmitri. Calvin was there too."
"1164"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) I was at a licensing place. Daryl was there and he had failed his test. Someone asked him how some pregnancy tests went. Dewey was there too. Then it was lunch at school. We were talking and he started dealing out cards. The game was really confusing. I went to the toilet. Then we were at Nana's, except it was home. Ezra and Dad were there. Poppa said no smoking and no kids in the room (games room). We had to go outside and I was complaining. I said ""We can't change it"" and Dad told me to ""accept it"" and I was like ""What the hell?! I just said that!""."
"1165"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) I was dressed up as a guy (was pretending to a transvestite). I was in the back of the car, out the front. A bunch of real transvestites were walking down the street so I hid. One came up to the car, so I got out and said ""What you looking at fool?!"" in a deep voice and they ran off."
"1166"	"(2007-04-07 (16)) Mom kept driving through all these McDonald's. Sometimes she wouldn't get me a thick shake, other times I would forget to ask. [The night before, she wouldn't get me a thick shake] ."
"1167"	"(2007-04-08 (16)) I was with Mom somewhere and she randomly said ""I thought everyone thought that Eugene was hot"" and I almost spat out my drink. She had gone to a shop six hours away. Scarlett was there and she said that she ""can't look him in the face because he is so ugly"". Mom suggested that I call his mother and thank her. I said that everyone thought that Darius was hot and she said something about me being different and I said that both were yuck. Then I was at home and Mom was going through my laptop and stuff. Dad did as well. Mom said that I had said that I wanted to go the ball ""for an instant"". I said ""No, I didn't"". Dad and I were late to go to the Little Britain thing. Silas called me and read off some joke about a woman wanting her boobs to grow. Ezra was in the car. Then, Dad and I were going to Little Britain, which was actually a second show. Silas and Seamus were going, but sometimes it was both of them, sometimes it was only one of them. Silas had seat I9 and we had I11 and I12. He came and sat next to us. David Walliams was on the stage and was walking on a tightrope which was over a pool of water with a 'shark' in it. He was wearing board shorts with a shark on them. Silas was pretending to swim. They played a video on a cinema looking screen with Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall and they were cops. It started off gay and David was reading a really boring news report. Then he said ""Why isn't anyone laughing?"" then ""Well there is this shit!"" and it turned into Little Britain. David Walliams was walking past and Silas leaned over me to see. There was a blackout and Seamus, Silas, David Walliams and I lost our memories. This lady was pretending to be Seamus's girlfriend and she was from Delaware. I recognized the people I knew and I knew she was a fake. I was later talking to David behind the seats, but he kept turning into Michael Rosenbaum. Seamus and Silas later joined us. Someone called me a virgin and Dad said ""She better be!""."

I had a chicken sandwich for lunch. Someone had this little wand thing. There was going to be a screening of one of two movies. Evelyn was worried that she would get scared."
"1170"	"(2007-04-09 (16)) Ezra was a bad guy, who was sometimes Ezra but sometimes not. I had to keep hiding Porky from him. I put her in this fridge and I had to take her out after a certain time. I went to the toilet. When I came out I went to put Porky in this room with beer. Ezra was there and he had big eyes and a firecracker had gone off. He said not to worry about hiding her."
"1171"	"(2007-04-09 (16)) I had an excursion and Dad was going to pick me up so I didn't have to go. But we were going to a shop and I figured I could hang out with Calvin and do whatever we wanted, so I went. Samantha was sitting near me on the bus which was on the top of a waterslide. This lady was driving and we went down the waterslide and back and down again. Then there were werewolves. This girl bit me because she liked me. Everyone disappeared. I said that maybe we can only see other werewolves. I was walking around a bus. I was then at a school and something happened and I did a reality check, which worked and it felt weird to breathe with my nose closed. I tried to keep my excitement down and I walked out of the room asking for my dream guide. I found some Indian guy and I asked if he was my dream guide and he said yes and walked into this classroom. I asked what his name was and he said ""Pazpah"". He wrote his first name and his last name on the board. His last name began with an 'M', but it was hard to pronounce, so I said ""I'll just call you Pazpah"". I said that I had read that it takes ages for most people to find their dream guide and that I've only been trying for a few days and this was kind of my first lucid dream. He asked if I ""trusted in it"" as much as the guy who wrote it [an article I read] . I said ""I don't think so"". He said that that was true. I said ""Well, it's a bit of a gay concept, isn't it?"". I lost lucidity for a minute. I was some girl in a different galaxy and I asked him take me home. When I was home, I was watching a weird movie and I did another reality check. Pazpah came and I was like ""So... I can ask you anything about me?"" and he said that I could. I asked if he could predict the future, for example, if how much I liked animals or people could determine what job I should take. He said that he could. I kept drifting into the dream but kept doing reality checks. One of the dreams I went to I was saying that I'd rather be a boy and I was someone else. Someone cut my hair and made it more boyish. I also kept asking about his life which I dreamt him answering, but I don't remember what he said. I couldn't think of what to ask him and I was thinking about a question about Eugene. I asked if he liked me and Pazpah said ""More than you know"" and I was thinking 'I highly doubt it'. I was going to ask something about Calvin, but I woke up."
"1172"	"(2007-04-10 (16)) Dad sold his work to me and Valerie. It had three floors. We lived on the third one and the bottle shop was on the second one. We had moved it to the first floor, but then back to the second. Farrah had her own room (hotel like) and was excited that she was living on her own. I was going out with James Spader, but he was 19 or something. One night we ran across this oval. I had some mark of a bottle shop. There was a group of girls and they saw it and were like ""Ooh! What shop do you come from?"". I said ""Northtown Tavern"" and they were excited. Then they followed us around. We were at this shop, which had a bottle shop in it called the Hoodoo Guru's and there was a song playing. I was playing this game somewhere, where you get three minutes and you have to run around a [pitch black] randomly generated maze and avoid getting caught by the 'tagger'. James and I went in and held hands so we didn't get separated. We won. Later, it was my birthday and James and his friend sent a card. James gave me $49 and his friend gave me $50. James was kind of poor. Anyway, I went to his work. Dad came there and he asked us what we did (as a couple). We were silent and he deciphered this as everything, but asked how many others do it and I said everyone does it. We played that game again. We got separated but both reached the end. The tagger, who was female, met us there. We were given characters at the start and we had to place this electronic thing on our characters symbol and we would be teleported away. One of us was a rat. James got out but she pulled mine out so I couldn't get away. I tried to play again but lost. I said ""But I won before, you have to let me out"". I got out later. Then two others and I were in a car and we looked upset [I was observing] . We got out and went to this grave on the side of the road. James was 'dead'. I was crying. He was there as a ghost and it was actually from his point of view -- he was seeing what would happen if he did die. He was saying stuff to me like ""Don't cry"" etc. I was thinking about killing myself."
"1173"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was at McDonald's. I was working and someone ordered 15 frozen Fanta's. I made two but then ran out of cups. I went to get some but I turned the corner and it was sparkling clean. I started talking to Co-Worker-F-01 and I forgot about the order. I then finished my shift and the people who ordered reminded me. I was then sitting at a table with some people from Queer as Folk (US). Hal Sparks and I were good friends. I wasn't really friendly with the rest of the cast. I was talking to Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie and I couldn't remember their real names, so was calling them by their characters names. Michelle kept saying that her character's name was Michelle."
"1174"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was somewhere. Some people came in and kidnapped us. They put us in these meditation beds and they were in rows, like lockers. Calvin was there. They said that every hour, they were going to kill two or three of us. They killed one row. I did something that gave me the impression that they liked me. Something happened and we got out. There were lots of cockroaches. We were following them to safety. Mom had also earlier predicted a storm coming. A storm was coming. The cockroaches were all running to cages."
"1175"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) Calvin text or called me and told me to get dressed because he was in Midvale. I was like ""What the hell?"". He came over and said that it was going to snow somewhere."
"1176"	"(2007-04-11 (16)) I was at a shop. There was this game where you run around this thing and win prizes. I ran six times but the guy wouldn't give me a prize. I took a balloon and this lady friend of ours took another one. We were running and mine was too hard to hold, so I let go. Then I was at this shop with Mom. It was called 'This Girl's Life'. Mom decided that we had to go in. They sold dresses and bags. I was running to get out. I saw these ads on the walls and they were of me and Tigger and I was little and modeling dresses. I was disgusted. I couldn't get out of the shop, but I finally did. I had these oranges. I went to the next shop and pretended that they were from there because they were cheaper to buy, but they looked totally different."
"1177"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) A spaceship landed outside Mom's. Ezra and I went in it. We accidentally started it up and we thought we'd just go along for the ride. Everything was automatic and it set the pressure and stuff for humans. We ended up at this little planet with people who looked like us. They spoke English but although they could make a spiffy ship, they couldn't read or write. They hadn't even heard of reading or writing and they were somewhat primitive -- they had no TV's or any of that kind of stuff. I told them that I would teach them how to write and stuff, for historical purposes. They wanted me to bring stuff from Earth for them to look at. There was this guy there who I liked. We had made a big list of stuff that they wanted. I was in this room and there were lots of people in there and this girl was going to have sex. I was like ""Don't you guys want to leave the room?"" and she was like ""Why?"". It skipped forward and the guy I liked came to Earth. He was driving a car and Darren tried to stop him. He, Darren and Mom got into a fight. Then he told them who he was and said he wanted permission to date me. Mom said no, but later I told her we'd been going out for a year."
"1178"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) I was at 'school' and I had an assembly. We were in this room which had steps with seats on them. I was sitting next to Silas at the very back edge. Colin Farrell was a special guest and I was like 'What the hell?!'. He asked for a volunteer and everyone stood up except for me. They sat down again and he picked me and I shook my head and said ""No!"". He then said ""Ok, Jenny Craig"" and Julianna went down. Colin asked me if I wanted to do the next one, which was going to be good. Then I was down the front and Calvin was next to me. Sounds Like a Melody came on and I said ""I love this song!"". The siren went before me and I was like ""Yay!"". He was giving autographs and I decided to get one. I said my name was Izzy and he was like ""Freya?"" and I said ""No, Izzy"". He wanted to put a picture of Santa on there. He also didn't have an accent and looked different."
"1179"	"(2007-04-12 (16)) I was at 'home'. This girl was there and she was being a cow. These people I was with were shouting back. She said something and I said ""That was mean"". This teacher told us off, especially me. I said that I didn't say anything. She said that my voice was the only one she could hear. I was like ""What the hell?!"". She said that I'd have to face that girl first period tomorrow. I thought that I had English first but she said ""Social studies""."
"1180"	"(2007-04-13 (16)) Mom kept buying new houses. One of them was just a square block. I was in the lounge. Samantha, some other girl and I always sat in certain chairs. On the back of the chairs there were 'shop' shelves. This footy game finished and all these people came in. Darius and Eugene were there. Mom found a house worth $70000."
"1181"	"(2007-04-13 (16)) I was at home and I went in the pool for a swim. I was in the shallow end and I got pulled to the deep end. I managed to get out and I went inside. It was different and I did a reality check and I worked. I saw someone so I wished for it to be Eugene. He stopped walking and turned around. I wanted him to kiss me and he put his hand on my face and we kissed."
"1182"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I was at 'Mom's'. I couldn't sleep and it was 5:30am. I had school that day. The lights were on and I couldn't turn the hallway light off. There were lots of iPods."
"1183"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I was at home. I did a reality check, which worked. I went to my room and tried to make it a different place, but it didn't change, so I went back down the hallway and wished for James Spader. I went back and he was there and my bed was coming from the window and we started kissing. I lost lucidity, and we ended up having sex. Later, I was talking to Vivian about lucid dreaming. There was a newspaper and I said now the writing will change. I turned around and it changed."
"1184"	"(2007-04-14 (16)) I had a few other lucid dreams but I kept feeling tired and falling out of them."
"1185"	"(2007-04-15 (16)) We had to hide out. Nana had this cottage thing in the woods. Ezra, Dad and Clayton came. It took ages to load up the car. We had to get in through this chimney to get in the house. There were cool science fiction movies. There was one with Tom Sizemore. Then I was at home out the front. I got the mail and there was something about Borat in there. Something said that Johnny Depp was ""my only"" and I was confused about it."
"1186"	"(2007-04-16 (16)) I was walking home from school, but I realized I forgot my keys so I followed someone to a house that Ezra was at. His leg was broken. I was then at school. I was late for class. I had a white book."
"1187"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I was at Mom's. I went into her room and there was a black guy on her bed. I was talking to Mom and then said ""Who the hell is this?"". She said ""a friend"". I turned around while I was still talking and when I turned back around Mom and the guy were kissing or something. I went back to my room but I came out later and discovered that Mom's bedroom was on fire. Mom wasn't in there and I got Ezra and I said that she wouldn't have run out because she would've got us. We got the fire out and then ran downstairs. The black guy's car was in the middle of the road. We ran out and Ezra was asking him where Mom was. I checked the back seat and then the boot. There was a big chest in the boot and Mom was asleep in one. I gasped and then pulled her out. The black guy drove off. We put Mom in her car and drove off to go somewhere. I then went back in time and was thinking 'what the hell?'. I went out of my room and Mom wasn't in her room, but then she came upstairs looking funny. The black guy came into her room. I punched him and then realized that he had Superman-type strength and had green 'pus' coming out. I realized that my laptop was missing and I said ""You can take her but give my laptop back, it isn't worth much. I'll give you $500 for it"". He stared at me for ages and then gave it back."
"1188"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I was at a video shop. There were kittens there. Someone had lost theirs. I was helping them gather them up, but there were so many of them. One lady wouldn't tell me the colour hers was. Then I was at 'school'. One of our teachers was Snape (Harry Potter movies). We were all sitting on the ground somewhere. I think we were choosing stuff."
"1189"	"(2007-04-17 (16)) I bought some Easter eggs. There were chocolate bunnies too. I remembered that I was on a diet, but didn't care. Mom and Ezra were there too and we went to a video shop."
"1190"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) We were on an excursion. Calvin and I were wandering around somewhere. He found this gown on the ground and put it on. This guy came and said it was his and I'm not sure what happened, but he started trying to rape me. Calvin hit him with something and we ran off. We started calling him 'Gay Boy'. Later, he was giving a talk to some people from school. He saw us and kept staring at us while he talked. Then we were somewhere else and it was 1:50pm. We needed to get back by 2pm. We thought the bus left without us. I saw people from Whitehall and we were throwing stuff at them. Later, there was this weird game and we could turn into things. I was a frog in a jar and Calvin was a chicken. We had to try and get out of the jar. I also turned into a llama. Later, I was having a bath somewhere and I finished and when I dressed, Darren came in and told me to pull the plug out. He looked in and said ""Try and get a redhead next time"" and left. I said ""Why are people so obsessed with redheads?"". The water looked funny as it drained. I picked up a CD I had in the bathroom and there was a dead lady in the bath. I couldn't scream or move, but eventually managed to run out. Darren went in but there was no lady. Later, Farrah was on a lounge and I thought I saw the lady in the hallway. Farrah was a clone of Farrah and was called something else. The lady came back but she had short blonde hair. Mom was there. I couldn't hurt the lady because she was a ghost. I was trying to 'believe' and then I could hit her. She disappeared. I went to the mailbox with Ezra and there was lots of mail. This poodle went up to Ezra. There was a grave next to the mailbox and I was scared that a hand would come up. We saw this court trial on TV and 'Gay Boy' was on there. Then we were there, and Calvin was staring at him because he loved him or something. We thought that Gay Boy was cool."
"1191"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) Dad knew I quit my job and when he asked why I said that I'd only lowered my hours."
"1192"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) This girl, a guy and I were talking. She was asking our grades and I was Year 11 and he was Year 7. But he had skipped a grade so he was the equivalent of a Year 8 or something."
"1193"	"(2007-04-19 (16)) I don't remember properly, but Lex (Smallville) either locked me in a room or we both got locked in a room. Someone had powers. We were near a jetty thing."
"1194"	"(2007-04-20 (16)) I was walking down a hallway and all these ghosts were floating around and going through me. I was then Simon Pegg and I was observing. He was the best ghost killer of something. I was in this room and looking out. Someone started shooting the ghosts so now they could see Simon. He had to run through the hall. For some reason, I went with him. We got into this big, flash, red car and weird Indian music was playing. He said he preferred ""doing it risky"" and started driving on the sidewalks and then shot at a bunch of cops. We ended up on the top of this giant glacier rock thing. The car was jumping onto other ones. He somehow managed to get us on the ground. We ran into this little hut. A cop grabbed me, but Simon got me back and took the cop with us. We went into another hut and hid behind this curtain. This other cop came, but didn't find us. We went out the back and Simon made some noise and then ran. We were climbing this gate and I said that I wished I was strong enough and I was thinking that all this should count toward my exercise (for my diet). I ended up in this section. He found something and I said that it was Danish and then saw this pipe and I realized that the cops were there. We hid for a while but then he yelled out to them and they put pumpkins on our heads. I had '2' on mine. Somehow I knew they were going to squirt us with orange juice."
"1195"	"(2007-04-20 (16)) I was half awake. Ezra was saying that Melanie was coming over because he invited her, but he was saying ""Why did I do that?""."
"1196"	"(2007-04-21 (16)) We found out something was happening in England. We had this map but it was really old and New Zealand was right next to the UK. We were going to leave that night. We went to this shop for a bit and my McDonald's was there. Someone said something about Co-Worker-M-07 and I left because I still hadn't told them I'd quit. We bought gloves from somewhere and we were going to buy more 'cold weather' stuff in England. Dad had to go to some place when he was going to travel. It was called Amsterdam something."
"1197"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I went to school and I was in my old English classroom. Ms Eckert was teaching us and Evelyn was there. I realized that it was impossible to have English, as it was Monday, so I said ""Screw this, this is a dream"" and proved it by doing a reality check. I was going to kiss Eugene as I was leaving, but I didn't. I then lost lucidity and Mom picked me and Ezra up. I went to the toilet and there were no toilet rolls. I had to get lunch for school, but we forgot. Mom went to this phone place. Santiago was there. I decided not to go back to school because it was 2pm. I said ""I had bio last"" but I was going to do it when I got home."
"1198"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I was at a shop. There were baby rabbits and I tried to take one because it was an evil place, but the shop just kept continuing when I tried to leave. Then, I was older and I had a friend who was Lana (Smallville) and two male friends called Ashley and David. Lana and I were seeing both, but I think I liked Ashley more. We all had separate tasks to accomplish. I don't remember mine, but Ashley had to fight a series of monsters. David had to escape two guys and one was really fast and was a big monster dude. I was watching Ashley when Lana said they needed to take me. I had to be injected with Ashley's sperm and have a baby. I refused, but they kept asking. I asked if it was virtual and she said yes, so I did it. It felt like something was in there, but something went wrong and the baby melted. Lana had already had one and they kept it. I decided I wanted one too, but I was all weird from the last one. David passed his task and we walked out of the shop together. These kangaroo people were having sex."
"1199"	"(2007-04-22 (16)) I was at school. Calvin was enemies with this fat girl. She had water coming out of her shoes and I my leg felt wet, so I figured she sprayed me, but she'd actually hit me with her belt. My leg was cut and bruised and people thought that I needed to be operated on."
"1200"	"(2007-04-23 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I played this game of sliding around a corner, but we kept getting in trouble. I was then at a shop and Ezra was there. Jeremiah walked past. Seamus and Silas were on an escalator. I was then back at school. I was at our bench. Ms Bigwood asked me if I ever liked anyone at school and I was thinking 'Yeah, Eugene, but I aint telling you!'. I said yeah and then she told us a story. There were big public toilets and people wouldn't leave?"
"1201"	"(2007-04-24 (16)) I was at 'Mom's'. There was a bull ant running around the house. I needed one for school and so instead of killing it, everyone was trying to catch it. They were really dangerous. Some boy wet his pants and the floor was really wet. I had told Mr Quinlan that Ezra said he'd seen him with Mom and he said it wasn't true. I said that I didn't think it was. I was in Mom's room and I saw the ant. She caught it with her fingers and I had to get a Milo tin with this spiffy lid. Someone pricked my finger and it hurt."
"1202"	"(2007-04-25 (16)) Eugene was sitting next to me. He was talking to someone and laughing. I think I was involved in the conversation too and I was looking at his hair and I wanted to touch it. I went to this lady's house with Mom and Ezra. She was rich and had this nice house. She gave us food. I was trying to work out what food I could eat because of my diet. We were hiding from someone. I was then at home and someone kept coming to the door trying to find me and I was pretending that I wasn't there."
"1203"	"(2007-04-25 (16)) Jesus just died. He went to this place and there were lots of people standing outside. This lady was talking to him. She said he was going to die again soon. All these people ending up chanting ""Jesus!"". And he looked like Tom Welling."

"1206"	"(2007-04-27 (16)) Clark and Raya (both from Smallville) were somewhere with me. I ended up with powers at one stage. Raya said we had to do something to this box. We didn't get near it though and it exploded. We moved away from it and it exploded again. It responded to movement, so we made everything in the shop that moved, move. I was then in a container as I had been captured for something. Raya hosted some dating show and matched me and Clark. Later, Dad was on the show. Raya said that the next match wasn't ""spiritual"", but purely from watching me because I was funny. The match was a black woman and Dad and I were laughing."

She lived on a street called Algiers or something. I remembered driving down it before with Mom. I ended up at this guarded place. Autumn was in there. They used it for experiments. There was a big shop/Timezone thing. We could play and take anything we wanted. There was a game where you throw spaghetti at the wall. Mom came and I managed to grab some chocolates. Autumn was asking us to tell her who liked her."
"1209"	"(2007-04-28 (16)) I was at some house and we had lived there forever. Ezra had a second room and it had two of my bookshelves in there. I found a heap of dreams I had written from 2001 and 2002 and some from 1996."

Then I woke up and in real life I had trouble breathing."
"1212"	"(2007-04-29 (16)) I was in a forest with Dad and Ezra. We were running away from the police. We took some of their uniforms. We went to go hide somewhere. We found this playground and were hiding in the structures. The police came and Dad and Ezra were talking to them and they didn't hide."

"1215"	"(2007-05-01 (16)) I didn't do an optional assignment in Physics. Mom was annoyed and really angry. She and Darren were talking about Nathan Greenbaum being a ""fatherly figure"". I thought they were talking about Dmitri, but then Mom said ""top of the class"" and I realized it was Eugene. She went to school and told them to put me into tennis. I was like ""What?! You can't put me in tennis, I'm doing six IB subjects!"". I had a plant and it moved. I was going to call it Harris, after Ryan Cartwright in Seriously Weird. Ezra and Clayton had some stinky thing. I couldn't smell it, but it hurt me and made my mouth taste yuck."

Ezra couldn't wait and opened up Diamond."

She said something that made me doubt it, so I asked what the last name was. She didn't remember but asked how many people would be called Darius. I asked if the last name was Ivanovich and she said it sounded right. She said that we had met before. I was thinking that I needed to text Calvin and that Evelyn would be happy about this. I was also thinking that I was glad it wasn't Eugene that I was related to. He was in a movie playing at this weird theatre. This guy gave people remotes and the guy next to me kept talking to me. I left. I was then somewhere with Nana. She had this video of Darius and a weird town which was mushed in a bowl. She had all these Pokemon Pearl games for the GameBoy Advance and I was wondering why she had them. Later, I was in a car with Ezra, waiting for Mom. We had 'P' plates."

It was Eugene. It was then not as dark. He saw me and was talking to Tanita, who was in front of us. She asked me something but I didn't understand and Eugene said ""You like me, hey?"" I said no. He said ""oh"" and looked shocked and started crying. Darius got annoyed that he was sitting next to me. Later, Eugene was on the phone and he was talking to Mom. There was a video on there of me when I was little. He said I was a cute baby and I said ""Ew, babies are ugly"". I ended up with my head on his lap looking up at him.

Ms Solomon asked ""Who gave you that?"" and we said ""No-one"". I was in class and I realized that it was Sunday. I was then confused why I was at school. The class had a different seating plan and I found an empty spot at the back, so I sat there. I saw a note on the desk two seats away, saying Swamp Boy. Eugene got up and sat there. He was asking about Swamp Boy. I realized that Calvin wrote it. There was a spelling mistake and it said ""Swampa Boy"". I saw Ezra. There was a list about Eugene that someone had written and it said ""caring, sensitive, aggressive, energetic, quiet""."

Alejandro said ""they're not full of colour, but they have lots of character"", but colour and character were supposed to be the other way around. Evelyn wanted to do a quiz thing I'd gotten. I was saying it was random. This bus drove into a book shop and I saw Goosebumps books and got excited. There was a big house and I was flying around and I fell.

Then another guy came and we jumped in another car and locked the doors and were winding the windows up. I put the games in the back seat. Mom drove and he started chasing us. She lost control and we hit a woman and crashed through a fence. We were then at a hospital and Ezra had a bloody face.

There was a book which was full of Heroes pictures and there were lots of Milo Ventimiglia. Calvin was next to me and Samantha was sitting on my other side. We had a quiz later to remember the names that everyone picked. Calvin's name was Nubu. I tasted this wine whose name was the name I'd picked and it was really hot. It burnt my skin too and everyone was throwing up from it. There were no booklets left, to mark off each wine which also described each one, so I had to tell this woman. She was all fancy like and looked like the Petrelli mother (Heroes). She was a cow. She didn't come until it was over. We had to stay until 1.30am to buy wine. Evelyn said ""I can stay till four"".

He pressed the close button but then the top was opening and then the side and he kept pressing all the close buttons. He got out and went to go outside. He heard a voice. A cop person told him not to go any further but he did and he got killed by some invisible thing. Earlier, the same thing had happened to a lady. It reminded me of Se7en and it also had '7' written on the bottom. I started writing a book. It started off about some woman snuggling in bed with her husband. Whatever I wrote was really well written though. I was thinking of calling the husband Eugene and basing it on Eugene. Mom and Darren were at the table (at Mom's house). It was in a different area and a house around the corner was on fire. I was watching something of these actors and stuff. There was a clip of Mika and ""how nice he is"". There were these goat/zebra things. He tried to hug it. Then he tried to hug these actors, but they didn't want him to hug them. Hugh Laurie was singing and he had piercings and I was like ""Yuck!""."
"1295"	"(2007-06-01 (16)) Calvin was in this big room full of quizzes and stuff I'd done. He was trying to find out who I liked (obviously, Eugene). I found this thing which had pictures of Johnny Depp, Devon Sawa, and Seann William Scott. I said it wasn't mine. Madelyn and Tucker were there. There was something about Sims 2 Seasons for the DS and it was weird."
"1296"	"(2007-06-03 (16)) I was at 'school'. Some others and I got caught by this evil Jack Nicholson dude. He made us lie down on our stomachs and he was going to infect us with some alien. When he wasn't looking, I ran. He started to chase after me, but this machine started up so he stayed with the other four. As I was running, I passed Ezra and some of his friends. I was running through the school and so many people were getting infected. There was a shop nearby and there were infected people there. The infected people were zombie-like but were Invasion of the Body Snatchers like and slowish at first. Then they were like the zombies in Dawn of the Dead original. Ezra and Clayton got infected. I ended up teaming up with some guy. Nana was at the shop and there was a photo of Dad on the wall. I was stabbing it because he was infected. I had tried stabbing a zombie but it didn't work. I told Nana not to talk to anyone and I left. I came back a while later and she was infected. This guy and I were at this shoe shop. We were hitting zombies with shoes and they were down with one hit. I was telling the guy to get shoes. We made a hide-out, in this little kitchen area with a curtain. I found his mother and she was infected. I told him and he was trying to talk to her. I saw Elijah and threw a shoe at his head and nothing happened. I said ""oh, you need two hits!"" and I threw another one and then realized he wasn't infected. Then, I was level 60 and I found this noob level 24 girl. She got some equipment from Red Rooster. We were going to this library to kill zombies. In the car park of this other shop there was a police car. Two policemen were in there, not infected and they were Scottish."
"1297"	"(2007-06-04 (16)) I went to some takeaway place. Mom ordered this thing with spinach and cheese. They gave her something else. I threw it inside and then went to talk to them and we were throwing it around. I left. This guy came after me. I ran into a shop and Nana was there. I called Mom. The guy was at the window. I managed to get to the car and Nana couldn't drive, so I got in the drivers seat and this evil woman was going to the passenger side so I took off. I almost crashed. I went home and there was no wood shed. Dad was there."
"1298"	"(2007-06-04 (16)) Clark and Lana (Smallville) were going to some school play thing and were standing near this rope. Someone was after Lana. Hugh Laurie was having a picnic at a park."
"1299"	"(2007-06-05 (16)) I was at Nana's. Ezra and Dmitri were there. This dog started attacking us. It was a werewolf gathering people for a reunion. It was evil."
"1300"	"(2007-06-05 (16)) I was at this house. There was lots of toast and there were two toasters. I wanted one of the milk things but I didn't like the ones in the fridge. I fell asleep and then it was six years later. There was this random flying lady."
"1301"	"(2007-06-08 (16)) I was playing this game where you get puppies. You had to click and drag to feed it and give it water. Drew Barrymore was around? Some people were talking about ""Chris Baby"" who was actually Chris Martin or whoever. I was on a bus and I was playing the game on DS. Jeremiah was sitting behind me and Eugene was sitting near me. Calvin was in front of me. I had brought an animal of some sort onto the bus, as did Ezra. I was doing stuff on the game. Eugene and Darius were on a balcony pretending to spit. Eugene was talking to some girl and Darius said ""stop talking to your girlfriend""."
"1302"	"(2007-06-08 (16)) I was taking my daily photo at some shop. I would always take it at this photo frame. One day, it was gone."
"1303"	"(2007-06-08 (16)) Some people were saying how they felt about horror movies. Then we were at this creepy place and went into this room. There were ghost ladies and I was trying to scream but they started strangling me."
"1304"	"(2007-06-09 (16)) I had my Biology exam. I was like ""What the hell?"". I hadn't studied. Mathea didn't know about it either. We both went over our notes. Ms Solomon came in and we suggested that we do it tomorrow. Ezra and Nicolas walked past. Mom picked Ezra, Mathea and I up. We went through this tunnel and the lights went out. There was a burglar and Mathea disappeared. We stopped somewhere and Clayton was with us. Mom drove off without me and I was left at this creepy motel. Mom came back and it was 2.44pm."
"1305"	"(2007-06-10 (16)) I went to the sun. I got trapped there with some guy, who was sometimes George (Grey's Anatomy). Then it wasn't me and it had been a while and they'd had a kid. If you didn't press hard against the ground you floated. There were zombies around. They (the lady, George and the kid) needed to leave so they hid in the bathroom. Then it was me. The guy got bit, so he quickly went over his plan and his eyes were going white and then I shot him in the head. The kid and I hurried to this slide. We got in this scooter thing and went down. Then I ended up in a big city and people were making a movie with zombies. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. I looked out the back and saw Tinkerbell and I was like ""What the hell?"". Spaceman was somewhere and he looked dead, but then he moved and he was ok."
"1306"	"(2007-06-10 (16)) I was sitting in the back of the car. Ezra was in the front and Dad was driving us home. There was this thing blocking the way. Dad drove into it but it was stretchy, so when we went forward Dad and Ezra were like ""oops"" and it flung back. I looked behind and saw a tree. I was picturing a branch going right through me, so I was thinking ""I'm dead"". Then it was minutes later. Timothy Stack had gotten in the way so he had been pushed into the tree as well as me, but we were ok."
"1307"	"(2007-06-11 (16)) Calvin, Ezra and Dad were in Dad's bed. Dad was up and it was like 4am. He hadn't put the washing out. My jumper and pants from Mom's had left this blue powder and dead mice on the floor."
"1308"	"(2007-06-12 (16)) Dad liked some movie program thing. I was on a site and it showed my password which was 'johnnyd' (I figured it was meant to be Johnny Depp), then it was 'johnnyb' and then 'jonasb' (Jonas Biggs). I was confused about it. I was in a line to get water at this cinema place. There were a couple people in the front and then suddenly I was miles away, so I gave up. Aunt Sally was in the line. Then I realized that I had a water bottle anyway."
"1309"	"(2007-06-12 (16)) I had a dream with Eugene, but I don't remember it now."
"1310"	"(2007-06-12 (16)) Mom was driving a car and there was a truck. There was something in the sky."
"1311"	"(2007-06-12 (16)) Mom woke me up and it was 11.30, so we didn't have to go to school and I was extremely happy."
"1312"	"(2007-06-13 (16)) Nicolas got his license (he was older than me) and so one day he had to take me school. He was swerving all over the road and went really fast. I was telling him off because you don't know what's around the corner; there could be people in the middle of the road. I was then at school. Calvin and Samantha had made a list of 'quotes'. They were random ones like 'school made' which was for Evelyn and Darius and 'Izzy's boyfriend' for Eugene. Samantha was pregnant."
"1313"	"(2007-06-14 (16)) I was at school. The teacher was calling out stuff and we were writing it down. Eugene was in front of me."
"1314"	"(2007-06-14 (16)) I was at a video shop and I saw Pink Flamingos there. This old lady saw my list of movies and was saying that I had good taste."
"1315"	"(2007-06-14 (16)) Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie Darko was being stalked by Frank. We were at this cinema thing. Everyone thought that he was majorly crazy and I was trying to stop people being mean."
"1316"	"(2007-06-14 (16)) I was at this place and Jason Lee was there. All these things were catching fire. There was ""an elephant"" in a tree, but it was actually a leopard. I was sleeping in a bottom bunk. I had my leg out and the leopard stepped down onto it and I could feel its paw on my leg. I was recounting the story later and Poppa was there."
"1317"	"(2007-06-15 (16)) I was at some place and I was running from a werewolf. It had a gun. I had trouble opening the door, but eventually managed to and ran in. Eugene, some girl and I were in there. I don't know what happened next, but Eugene and I were going out a window. He had been bit and had a couple of 'powers'. Later, we lived together in some house. One night the girl went out to a forest and started taking her clothes off because she was going to turn into a werewolf. At the house, some people were at the door and we were trying to decide whether to open it, then they started chipping at the window. We opened the door and there were two girls. Some guy wanted to talk to me and he told me that I had to be the ""bad guy"". They said they were going to take Eugene. I could run like Clark Kent, so I went to 'run' to him, which would actually teleport me to where he was, but it didn't work because of something they had done."
"1318"	"(2007-06-15 (16)) We were looking at beds or something. Ezra was going to have this squishy one in the wall. I was getting a big one."
"1319"	"(2007-06-15 (16)) Hiro (Heroes), Joy (My Name is Earl), a guy called Randy, Jason Lee and I were on the run from the cops. First we were at this park. It was just me and Jason Lee. We were running down this road and the cops were behind us and this dog appeared in front of us, so we ran down the side street. Later, we were all at this cafe. We ran off and stole this car because we had to leave the cafe. There was a 4wd type of car and we had to hotwire it, which Jason could do. We got to the car as the cops pulled up. We kept our heads down and got in. This had happened before, but Joy had looked up and this guy had seen her and described her. So I told everyone to keep their heads down, especially Joy. All of a sudden, the cops were after us. Joy had looked at a guy because he had brown hair. The car we were in had a tracking thing, so when we were lots of traffic, we got out and ended up at this place with all these Soylent Green-y things. We were hiding under them. Jason got shot. There were other people there and I was letting them carry me along. I got carried to this place with squishy balls and I dyed my hair black. Poppa was there and he didn't recognize me. There were stripper girls near so I pretended to be with them. Somehow, we all got out, but by this time Hiro was dead and Joy was now Cate Blanchett, but looked like Claire Danes. There was a foggy road in the forest. Randy was going to kill us. I was like ""You're going to kill your own brother?"". He said it was his fault. I said it was all our faults. He ended up not killing anyone. The cars were going like 120km/h. We were dodging the traffic. Later, we realized this black guy who had once been with us, was going to kill us. So we left to go the airport. We were driving down this road and this bridge thing which was over the road, got wider as we got closer. In the airplane, I was holding Jason's hand."
"1320"	"(2007-06-17 (16)) I was at a hotel place with a friend. I went to get a room and I was given a table. My friend's room could only fit her. I went somewhere and my friend paid $100k to get the room expanded so that I could sleep in there."
"1321"	"(2007-06-17 (16)) I went to England. It was snowing and I was really excited. Ezra and I went to a shop. I was thinking 'Hello, we're Cockneys!'. I ate lamingtons at the shop. I was looking at stationery and was talking to some guy. Someone pulled down these quiz things from the roof. Paul Whitehouse was there and we knew each other and he did some quizzes too."
"1322"	"(2007-06-17 (16)) Ezra, Clayton, some others and I were at this spooky house. We went in there and we had Pokemon with us and these creepy 'Chibi' people were giving me scents. I was thinking they were useless since I couldn't smell. I was playing some Mario game and I had to get up this waterfall and I found this thing to help me. I thought it would help me fly but it just made me go a bit faster."
"1323"	"(2007-06-18 (16)) I was at Red Rooster with Dad. We went through the drive thru. They gave him his order, but they all disappeared and I was about to go in and get my order myself when they all came back."
"1324"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) I had a dream with Jason Lee, but I don't remember now."
"1325"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) This lady was pregnant. This guy went inside her stomach, as she had an opening on her side. I went to school to get my brush. I didn't want to go in so Ezra and Mom did. We had to line up, so Ezra just reached over and grabbed it. There was an explosion outside. There was a thing with sport coaches. Loren Dean and James Spader were listed. James was the best coach."
"1326"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) I was at the shop near the clothes section. Bradley and Eugene came in. I had seen them there before playing some game. They asked me who I thought the killer was and I said to Bradley ""you"" and he said ""No, Eugene""."
"1327"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) Dad was seeing some woman called Zamba. There were these human body bloopers and it was showing the bits exploding, including a finger and a penis."
"1328"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) I had a dream with Paul Whitehouse, but I don't remember it now."
"1329"	"(2007-06-19 (16)) Ezra took my diary and I took it back."
"1330"	"(2007-06-20 (16)) We were driving to school. I was in the front. Eugene's car was behind us and he was sitting in the back. His brother Rodney and his father Abraham were in there too. Then Ezra and I were in the back and the car 'flipped' so that we were joined to their car by the front of the car. Rodney came into the car and was talking to Ezra. Then Eugene came and looked into the car from the front. He saw me and went a bit weird. He and Ezra were talking and I managed to join in the conversation and he was no longer uncomfortable. After school we were all walking home together. I did this flip and Eugene was like ""What the hell?!"" Mom told me to meet Janice off Nanovich Ave. Their mother was called Janice and their father was called Lionel. Eugene's house was number 74. The number was on the window. They were a couple of houses away from a video shop. There was a gambling place too and this black guy was guarding it. Ezra wanted to play."
"1331"	"(2007-06-20 (16)) I was at school and there was this x-ray thing. I didn't realize I was being videoed and I had been picking my nose."
"1332"	"(2007-06-20 (16)) I was doing homework for people. I watched Happy Feet and did an essay on it for someone. Ezra was talking to me."
"1333"	"(2007-06-21 (16)) Johnny Depp died. There was some clip of him with Paul Whitehouse. People thought that I was going kill them because I had some number. They realized that it was my number."
"1334"	"(2007-06-21 (16)) Mom was driving me from school and she drove down an alley. She had trouble getting through this gate. Then we were at this place and I realized that we were on Casserley Ave. so I had a quick look around the corner for Eugene's house, but there was this big empty tank thing with bugs in it. There was pretty water around it though."
"1335"	"(2007-06-22 (16)) We were doing a Battle Royale 'game'. Samantha, someone else and I were hiding out on some rocks. We ended up hiding at home and the wood door wasn't closed. I saw people on the street and I was worried that they saw me and I managed to get the door closed. Mr Willingham was trying to kill me for some reason. I jumped over the back fence. Later, there were three people left and Eugene had already died. I ended up winning, I think."
"1336"	"(2007-06-22 (16)) Mom said that she was going out with this computer developer guy and Ezra thought it was this guy called Apex. She was showing Dad what street he lived on. He lived on the same street as Apex but she said something that made it sound like it was someone else. I went to some other high school for a day. We had an excursion. Mr Reilly was there. We went to this place where Apex worked and he said something about him and ""Sasha have a fling at the moment"". There were all these collages of Johnny Depp. I decided I wanted to go home, so I got up and left. My tooth hurt. I called Mom and she was being gay and wouldn't pick me up. People were trying to make me come back. There was this 'grab bag' game thing. There were lots of hats and one looked like a Ted (The Fast Show) sort of hat. I got a heater and a TV out of the bag. There were Pokemon around. I remember Slugma and Farfetch'd, who I or someone else accidentally killed. I had some 'snowbar' thing."
"1337"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) I was watching some Ted and Ralph (The Fast Show) thing. I don't remember properly, but Ted had fallen in love with this guy who I think was a 'bad' guy. Ted was making out with the guy on a bed."
"1338"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) I was going through a DVD of The Fast Show. They had documentaries and Paul Whitehouse was dressed like the Brilliant Kid, which was his natural clothing. They were trying to use this 'skimmer' thing. Charlie Higson was there too. Bizarre Love Triangle was playing. I was looking through these pictures and Dad was in there and I was like ""Oh my God! Dad knew Paul Whitehouse!""."
"1339"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) There was a werewolf, and it was actually a person I didn't like. I didn't know it was them, but when they were normal, I saw their reflection in the mirror and they reflected as a werewolf."
"1340"	"(2007-06-23 (16)) Paul Whitehouse and I were friends and we swapped bodies. I had to go to the toilet at one stage and pulled down 'my' pants, but then didn't because I didn't want to touch his bits and didn't know what to do. I then complained to him about it. Then, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson swapped bodies. I kept getting them confused. Paul (as Charlie) kept getting drunk. Charlie (as Paul) was annoyed that he was making him look stupid. We were on this bus thing and I lost my pen and was testing another one. I wrote 'Ted, Paul Whitehouse and Ralph'. I was then at home with some people and we were looking out the back door. Then we were in this forest and stuff from Deadbirds was happening, except I kept forgetting what happened. Ryan Merriman was there. There was this creature. These aliens were recruiting people. Some others came along."
"1341"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) Ezra and I were in a park. We were playing this game where we run back and forth with words. Mom was there."
"1342"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) I was watching Heroes. Micah was on a train. First he was a girl. Peter was there and Micah wouldn't jump until Peter did. The platform ended and Peter jumped. Micah was still on the train as it left. Sylar was around. Peter was crying and I was calming him."
"1343"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) Two others and I were hiding out in a deli thing, which was actually part of a school. Something was going to happen so we hid. These people came and they didn't see us because someone had died? We had a bucket for spit."
"1344"	"(2007-06-24 (16)) I was at Nana's and they had a Playstation 3 so I was having a look at it. There was some game that was like Age of Empires. Dad wanted to see the game. I started it and it was Battle Royale like. I realized and threw my bag off my bag looking for my weapon. It was a machine gun. Then it was real. I grabbed all my stuff and I was near a wood shed so I hid in there. This guy came along and hid there too. This other guy said this guy was coming to check out the shed so we all left. Shinji Mimura (Battle Royale) was there so I hung with him. This guy was around the corner with a gun and we managed to calm him and take his gun. Someone was threatening us and we shot them and the bullet was slow. Shinji ran to it and put in the other guys neck. Then these people were at this shop. This guy said ""I hope my wife isn't on that list"". People were discussing the best fashion of spring etc. Jason Lee was there. There was a basketball and he said that he could do lots of tricks."
"1345"	"(2007-06-26 (16)) I was at Mom's. I died, but I was hanging around. Sometimes I could interact with stuff and I was learning how to fly. I had to go to the balcony and jump off. I didn't like that bit though. There was a trampoline out the back, but it was wet. I had to get the hose and put it in a hook. The hooks were all marked with Spaced characters. Mark Heap was in the yard, and I put the hose between his hook and someone else's. Mom was seeing this black guy. I was scaring some blokes. It turned David Lynch like and I was observing and everything was different. Jack Nance was there and he had orange hair [like Colin Hunt in The Fast Show] . Someone had their hand and foot on the doorframe, curled up. This girl was in a room and she was all jerky like. Later, I was at home telling Dad about my dream. First I was lying in front of the heater. Ezra said I wasn't going to school today because I got the day off. Dad made a joke about trying to learn how to fly for three days. There was a house thing called Riff Raff, which only had two walls. I was then at Mom's again. She woke me up and I was writing down my dreams. I accidentally wrote in my fat little notebook. My dream was about Tinkerbell and Mittens."
"1346"	"(2007-06-26 (16)) I was saying ""Brilliant!"", whilst trying to copy Paul Whitehouse's voice. I was saying 'holes' and then said school but was then like ""Nah, that's horrible""."
"1347"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at school. I was in a group with Jeremiah and Alejandro and probably the rest. Jeremiah told me not to go to school tomorrow because of an assembly first period (on Wednesday)."
"1348"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at an airport/plane place. I was quoting The Fast Show and I saw Paul Whitehouse's name on the floor and a picture of him as Suit You on the wall. There were other celebrity people too. Martin Balsam was one of them. Some guy complained about a Colin Farrell impersonator. The creepy guy from Idiocracy was there. I was looking for Paul Whitehouse. This weird dude was annoying Dad."
"1349"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Elijah was driving and I was asking him how he was. I was somewhere else and Ms Solomon was explaining how she plans her lessons. Darius wanted to do something. We were lining up somewhere and I was looking for Eugene."

"1351"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) This guy had no legs and was getting pulled along behind a car. Evelyn said ""My father explained that to me""."
"1352"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) I was at the bench. I saw Mr Macklin walking down the corridor (and he had long hair). I went up to him and I told him who I was. He was like ""Uh... oh yeah, you did badly"". Calvin was at the bench."
"1353"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Calvin and I were walking down a street. I realized it was a dream and I ran off trying to wish for Eugene, but I lost lucidity."
"1354"	"(2007-06-27 (16)) Dad and I, and sometimes Ezra, went to some weird place for a movie. It was called Freaksville or something. These two pale kids were hanging around. They kept annoying me. One was smoking and I was complaining about their parents and one started crying. I calmed them down. One of them was my age and the other was 17. One looked like a toddler but was 18. These people gave us these cakes and they had onion in them. All the food had onion in them. We were all in water. The guy my age choked on a toothpick and no-one knew and he sank underwater. He said that he saw an image. He managed to get above the surface. The 17 year old had only a few days to shoot his role in the movie as he started school soon. Mom and Ezra came somewhere near there later. They saw Roland's car in the bush. There was this party thing. This lady was doing a quiz. She or someone knew all the answers. The guy who was my age had become a playboy but regarded me as his best friend. I was hoping he wasn't Ethan Hawke because he's ugly."
"1355"	"(2007-06-28 (16)) We were participating in a Battle Royale thing. There were two groups; the sickles, who were bad, and swords, who were good and also my group. A sickle and I were having an argument. This girl came and helped. Charlene came and gave a sickle to each of us, then joined the other girl. I saw a girl bleeding and went over and checked for weapons and said ""I'm not going to hurt you, but she is"" and pointed to Charlene. We got away and met up with others. I went off by myself into this big place inside. Bradley was there and he had a sword. A sickle attacked me and Bradley tried to help. The sickle said something about hurting Eugene. We escaped. I saw Alejandro and he had a sickle and I said ""Not you!"" because I thought he was a sickle, but he was a sword. We saw Jeremiah later and Eugene was standing in the background. Calvin and Samantha joined up with me. We went to a playground and there was a fishing thing. Teachers were coming and I saw Mr Reilly. We had to hide, but couldn't in time. I went to hide, but I fast-forwarded it and a girl saw me, so I rewound. I realized that I was going to get caught so I paused it and told the people I was with to stay there because they would be safe and that I had to leave. Calvin was like ""why not take us?"". He was supposed to be paused too. Later, Mom and Ezra were watching Battle Royale II, which was what just happened and at the 'time' part, I said ""This part sucks, but it was a dream""."
"1356"	"(2007-06-28 (16)) I was at Nana's and there was some dating thing. I told her to turn the TV off and I bolted out the door and she was like ""huh?"". I said the dating thing was a joke and that I didn't realize it was her. Clayton was pulling a rope on this big machine so that the door would open."
"1357"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at school at the library, because I had Biology. Eugene was there on a computer. Calvin and Genevieve came later and sat next to Eugene. There was a new door for the library, which was saloon like, but in two sections. I was telling Ezra about it. Ms Solomon came in. During Accounting, we had to go get our photos for the yearbook taken. The Year 12's had to go to the library. Farrah was there, saying hello. Evelyn came. It was Lillian's turn and she was talking. The lady asked if she wanted a group hug and Eugene was like ""Yeah, come on!"". A lady said she'd videoed me at lunch. Later, someone was killing people. I was ok. Elana, Autumn, Madelyn and someone were in a car. They decided to separate. Autumn went into a hole. Elana and this girl went back to school and the killer was still there. They were on a horse and got shot. It was movie like."
"1358"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at home. It was creepy and I was going to call Mom. The light wasn't turning on. I was locking the back door."
"1359"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I got my laptop back and the files were deleted and they looked weird. The Star Trek movies were gone."
"1360"	"(2007-06-30 (16)) I was at Nana's. I got my laptop back. Mom's friend was called Pale. Mom said that it wasn't the usual model he worked with, but I could sign in now. It was like Sims 2. Mom kept calling my laptop Andrew. We were then on the back of a Ute and holding onto the rails. The bridge had the word BRIDGE on it. Then we were in a normal car. I saw Rodney outside a newsagency on the street. I was looking for Eugene. I saw Elijah."
"1361"	"(2007-07-01 (16)) There were some stairs or desks in this place. Seamus was in there doing a test."
"1362"	"(2007-07-01 (16)) I was at home. Nana lived out the back in a little house with three kids (it wasn't Nana all the time). Dad was selling the house so I was wondering what was going to happen to it."
"1363"	"(2007-07-02 (16)) I was at school. Eugene and his group were nearby. They were making jokes about me and Eugene. Someone said that I should give a photo of who I like to Eugene. Someone else said ""Nah, she likes Eugene""."
"1364"	"(2007-07-02 (16)) Granny died. The wake was on the same night. Mom and I went to this house. I didn't go to the wake because I thought it was stupid. I was upset later. Then I was at school and we had an excursion to the shop. Silas and I were there and there were these videos of people and chairs (I don't remember what was happening). Someone was chasing a ferret and I was thinking about Porky. I was telling Dad why I wasn't at school."
"1365"	"(2007-07-03 (16)) I was on the net. I had emails and one was from Classmate-F-08 and I sent one to Gavin, but he was called Gavin Howd. I was going through my old emails and there were some from Valerie, which were all about Runescape. Gavin replied and he said that he got ""13, 3"", which was a good level, for something he'd written about himself for school, so he had sent me that. He liked Oldboy."
"1366"	"(2007-07-03 (16)) I was at a fair. Presents were floating around, like in Animal Crossing, and I also had a slingshot. People fell from the sky with lots of presents and sometimes holidays. I went over to this lady, who was near a Ferris wheel. As I was walking under it, it fell, but I was in between all the bits and pieces and so was ok. This lady who had fallen from the sky had stuff and I traded a lump of Quikeze for it. Adam Sandler's father's name was 'Boney Boney'."
"1367"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I was at school. Calvin and I went up this hill and there were all these bugs and cockroaches. Ezra came up once too. We were sitting up there but it was making us too itchy."
"1368"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) We had a new house, but we weren't settled. I had a gay bed. My computer was being screwy. Mom was there."
"1369"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I was watching some movie with John Cusack in it. He was wearing this green suit thing and he looked really hot in it. A scene in it reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Joy (My Name is Earl) was singing and she was covered in makeup. I was on my laptop and Ezra was there on his."
"1370"	"(2007-07-04 (16)) I saw that the music video for Black Man Ray was on the TV, but it was halfway through. It was different to the real one."
"1371"	"(2007-07-05 (16)) I was somewhere and Mom was there. I needed her to say something for me for some court-like thing. The Doctor (Doctor Who, as David Tennant) came somewhere and went to these men and he said to buy him ""three drinks, no, two"" because they thought he was crazy the last time. He then passed out."
"1372"	"(2007-07-05 (16)) Some guy had those gas masks, like in the episode of Doctor Who. Earlier, he killed the Doctor (David Tennant) and someone else. I got trapped somewhere underground. There were lots of people down there, including some soldiers and Ezra. The soldiers though, I think, worked for the bad guy. When the bad guy released the 'gas-mask disease', by opening a window and put this girl with a gasmask on through it, everyone ran. The soldiers got attacked too. Ezra and I escaped. Then we were at Mom's. The Doctor woke up. He came to us and someone went down the stairs and we followed. I had my arm around The Doctor's waist, to help him walk. We ran out and Mom, Ezra, The Doctor and I got into the car. Mom was driving and I was in the driver's seat. This guy's parrot kept falling in this hole. Mom said she had been infected. She tried to kill this other parrot. The road was wet, and we slid on it. Then we realized that she really had been infected. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. The hair straightener was around. The bookshelf was in the kitchen."
"1373"	"(2007-07-06 (16)) I was at a shop, but the 'shelves' were all metal and there wasn't much merchandise. There was a Dalek and a bunch of soldiers there. There were also civilians. The Dalek and I were killing the soldiers. Then we stopped because we couldn't win (which I questioned). Then I told the Dalek we should work together and they all died. We had to kill the people and animals too, but I couldn't kill the animals so I told the people to follow me. We ended up at this place and Jennifer Saunders was holding the door open. Dawn French was also with her. They had this auditorium thing, so we all went in. Mom and Ezra were sitting there in different seats, so I called them over."
"1374"	"(2007-07-06 (16)) I was in England. I was riding a weird buggy thing through this patch of forest. There were lots of snakes. I got out and there was a big oval thing, so I walked on that. I saw Calvin riding another buggy. I was then at some old mans house, then it was an old lady. She was asking me what I wanted to eat, and I had a choice of different biscuits, which had names in different languages. She pulled a banana out of the skin and basically told me to have sex with it. I was like ""Ew!"". The bananas were fluffy. She thought that I liked this David guy and crossed off his name. She had R.B. Greaves on the list too. Then I was at this place which looked like Mom's house. The lights were off and something was coming up the stairs. It was this evil guy and I was trying to scream."
"1375"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) I was at Mom's. Clayton and someone else were staying over. Ezra said they had to sleep in my room and I said no. Mom and Darren were in Ezra's room on mattresses on the floor and Clayton was sharing Ezra's bottom bunk."
"1376"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) I was at home and Dad had to get me breakfast and lunch, but he ended up at the beach. Valerie was there with Farrah and the rest of them, but I didn't see the others. They all had books about their life. They had shown me the book when they first started it."
"1377"	"(2007-07-07 (16)) Dad was watching a movie about Fergie. I was like ""Yuck!"" and watched a little bit of stuff about John Lennon, Michael Palin and Terry Jones and some fat guy, who was in everything. I was telling Ezra that my blue jumper was the fat guys."
"1378"	"(2007-07-08 (16)) I was at home. I made a ham and pickle sandwich and left in on a plate in the sink. I came back a while later and it had fallen into some water. Then, it was a chicken sandwich and there was a chicken on the breakfast bar. I started making two vegemite sandwiches and noticed there was this white, cream looking stuff in it. I was wondering what it was. I then found some light brown stuff too and I thought it was poo, and thought maybe it was like the Hide-the-Poo game. I told Dad and we were reading the ingredients and they were new. It was also supposed to have a red crab in it. I decided not to have a sandwich."
"1379"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) I did drama, as did Calvin, for semester two and we had it in the chemistry room. I didn't like it. I complained to Mom. I had to do some project on Cleopatra. Dad and Darren were there. Darren and Mom were both on the computer. This police woman came and she asked me I was Izzy Conell. Dad said no, but Mom gave it away. Later, Mom said my name and I said I wanted to go home, because I didn't want to have to talk to the police lady."
"1380"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) There was this film set. These bombs were exploding near this guy, which was a mistake. Peter Jackson was the director. The main lady said that Leo (DiCaprio) was complaining about their ""chemistry"". She couldn't fall over in sync with him, etc. This robot was flirting with this chair. This lady was playing this computer type game and this big guy was like ""Are you waiting for her?"". He was singing a song."
"1381"	"(2007-07-09 (16)) This girl and boy (who were brother and sister) could travel back in time. They were gone for a while at one stage and when they came back their mother was really excited. She had moved house since then and they wanted to bring her back in time. They chose the 1700's. Then we were there, sitting at a table outside somewhere. There was a poster with classical composers. I was saying that Beethoven and Mozart rock. The cups were really solid. They were hanging people there. I spoke with a British accent and was saying how one place I went to thought that the accent was rude."
"1382"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) I or someone had drawn a picture called 'The Kiss' of this guy and a girl. I was thinking about me and David Tennant. Then I was Clark Kent (Smallville) and he was giving it to this girl who liked him. Someone had done a painting too."
"1383"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) This house was empty. Ezra and Mom wanted to steal a car. We couldn't find it, so we left. Police were coming."
"1384"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) Heather Graham wasn't wearing any pants and her legs were really hairy. She was on a stage. Everyone was like ""ew"" and she was just like meh."
"1385"	"(2007-07-10 (16)) I was at school. Some people and I were doing a test. I had a headache. Elana was there. I realized later, they were trying to erase our memories and control us. I was in my room at Mom's and Clayton and a made-up friend of Ezra's called Jeffrey were there. They fell out of my bed. Jeffrey couldn't hear anymore and we all had to collect letters to answer some questions. An answer to one was Patchy. For some reason I needed an 'S', so I put 'sparkle'. I forgot to cross it off. Ezra was there. Later, I was at school and they were asking about it. I was writing and my spelling was all weird, along with other people. Something said ""love Izzy"" then ""more than Eugene"". I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this back needle thing."
"1386"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who stuff. There were outtakes with The Doctor (as David Tennant) and Rose."
"1387"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was at school and it was lunch. I had written something about Jayson on the bench. Silas had written 'your' Jayson Dillard. Silas found heaps of pictures in my diary of David Tennant."
"1388"	"(2007-07-11 (16)) I was at some school thing. I was looking for Eugene. Ms Newberry said my name. There was a room with cakes. A couple of girls came in and they picked a dress and they got the corresponding cake. There was some game thing where you find one coin alone in it's year. The bowl was almost empty, so I went through it. There was rabbit poo in there too. The window opened and this burglar came in, I was like 'what the hell?'. Someone made them go through the poo."
"1389"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who. Rose had come back and she wouldn't say how. Martha and The Doctor (David Tennant) were there too. They were at this place and there some evil blokes. They all got separated and could talk to each other over these speakers. Rose thought that she was going to die. There was some washing place with clothes. They tricked the bad guys, but then they caught on."
"1390"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was at deli with Mom. I wanted Fruit Pastilles. She got them and was embarrassed about something and wanted to leave. There was some nice chocolate. Later, you got points for certain creatures. There was some scorpion thing and I was reading the scorpion list. There was a slug that looked like a dinosaur with a slug instead of a horn on its back."
"1391"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) I was watching The Simpsons, and the family had disappeared. It showed Marge getting out of a cupboard and there were police downstairs. She had an old lady with her and she was like 'she's useless' so got rid of her and ran off."
"1392"	"(2007-07-12 (16)) Ezra had a moving van with a BIG box."
"1393"	"(2007-07-13 (16)) Dad picked me and Ezra up from school because Mom was sick. I complained about this. Eugene was nearby. When I got in the car, I looked back at him. Dad gave Ezra a ticket, which I realized was to see some movie, which I also wanted to see. When we got home, I asked about my ticket and Dad had figured that I wouldn't want to see it and hadn't gotten me a ticket. I was angry. I asked to be dropped off at Mom's. Seriously Weird was on TV and it was an episode I hadn't seen. I was thinking that Ryan Cartwright was hot."
"1394"	"(2007-07-13 (16)) I was at school. The day before, we'd been given a list of the Top 250 on IMDb. I had scribbled on mine and the next day we were told it was required, so I asked Ms Newberry for another one. I was watching 28 Days Later... and Cillian Murphy looked like a cross between Tom Welling and Ian Somerhalder."
"1395"	"(2007-07-14 (16)) I was in France or something. Granma and Uncle Gabriel had taken me to some place. People there were evil and trapped us. There was this weird water and we were training ourselves to breathe in it. David Tennant and I were in it, but then we looked like weird plesiosaur type creatures, and I was observing. Then we were human and we kissed. Later, I had befriended this guy who looked like Laurence Fishburne. We were all escaping. Laurence was helping us and we had to jump over some platforms. We had to go down these steps and there was a GIANT cockroach and this little flying bug kept falling. The bug had to be up for you to go down. This girl saw the cockroach was like ""Hell no!"". Then it was loose, and I ran up the steps. The girl and I ran to the exit and Laurence stayed to fix the cockroach. This gate was open. Earlier, some girl had electrocuted herself on it. We went to the car and there was a shelf in the back and it was a truck thing. I was trying to remember where to go. There were photos of Ezra and also Wallace, Tiana and Julius. I tried to ask for help, but everyone only spoke French."
"1396"	"(2007-07-15 (16)) I was in the UK on an oval. I was saying how awesome it was. I was sometimes in Year 12, but mostly it was this year. I went to this school for a day and I had to wear a skirt. I had sport there one day and Evelyn was there and this red-haired girl with freckles. Later, I was talking to Silas and he wrote some stuff down. One was that ""Dmitri had a crush on you from 1999-1966"" because he saw me making azaleas. He looked at what he wrote and was confused and then he crossed the reason out and changed the date to 2006-2007. I was thinking 'No way!'. I found a book of mine and it had lots of my stuff in it and I had done an assignment on Loren Dean and I got excited. Silas had done an assignment on Dylan Moran. Later, I was talking to Eugene. We were going out and he didn't want me to move to England. I was friends with the whole cast of some show. Paul Whitehouse was there, so I'm presuming it was The Fast Show. This car was 'on fire' for some effects thing."
"1397"	"(2007-07-17 (16)) I was somewhere and I started crying. Dad and Ezra were there too. All these randoms started hugging me. Later I went to school and my hair wasn't straightened. I was in the 'science room' and Silas and a bunch of people were laughing at my hair. I got this torch and left. I went up a hill and left. We had a new house. I forgot my keys. I called Mom and then noticed the back door was unlocked. I saw two Spaceman's. There were cracks in the middle of the walls. I told Mom and she said it was a burglar, but she didn't want to be bothered because Slater was going to die today from tuberculosis. Clayton was around."
"1398"	"(2007-07-17 (16)) Rose, Martha, The Doctor (David Tennant) and I were hanging around. Rose and Martha were annoyed at each other. Some big alien bloke thing came and pulled the TARDIS underground and replaced it with some toy thing. He knew it was a time machine. We all ran off and the Doctor and one of them ended up somewhere else. I went in this shop looking for them. I ended up in this arena and saw The Doctor, and I found him because I saw his coat. There was this virtual tennis, but not. The tennis ball would fly out at the crowd. A monster came and the lights went out. I was hiding with The Doctor. We were climbing up a pole and it had these spiky things. It fell, but I was ok."
"1399"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) The Doctor Who episode of The Weakest Link was on TV. There was a bit before the show where a few days earlier, Noel Clarke, Masi Oka and James Kyson Lee had gone into the studio to mess around. They had pegs to put their picture up. James pegged his head instead. David Tennant and Anne Robinson also appeared. Later, I was in the car and they were going to play it on the radio. Dad and Ezra were waiting for it and got out. Dad got rid of the station."
"1400"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) I was at Mom's. I had all these internet pages open on David Tennant. She was looking and I was trying to hide it."
"1401"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) There was some show with Ellen Burstyn when she was young. She looked like Anna Paquin. I started downloading season one."
"1402"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) Something happened and there was going to be a huge demand for food. Darren had chips in the car, so we ran out to get them (we were at school). The school had chocolate, including Picnics. There was something about Brad Pitt. People started running out to get food."
"1403"	"(2007-07-18 (16)) I saw a Daddy Long Legs near my bed, and then realized there were heaps. Mom looked and there were millions under the blanket on the top bunk. I was like ""Where am I going to sleep?"" and Mom went to sleep and forgot about me. There was some 'itchy test' and some squishy thing."
"1404"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who. The Doctor (David Tennant) landed right in front of some cops. Some girl's sister died and her other sister went loopy. The older one befriended The Doctor somehow. The cops were trying to map out the TARDIS, but they couldn't get in. Obviously, it was big. The Doctor and the girl were in a backyard and there were smokes on the windowsill, so The Doctor was having a smoke, and I was thinking he was hot. The mother of the girl turned up and he realized they were all bad and he shot the mother because she was going to shoot him. Darren woke me up to open his door. There were clothes that I was supposed to pick up. Quincy's phone was there."
"1405"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who with Ezra. Mom later said that Ezra hated it, but I didn't think he did. People were doing an assignment on Rose, on why she cried at the end. I was like ""They can't put that in there!"". The Doctor was at this poor place and this girl liked him and followed him. I realized later that he didn't have a companion. This doctor was before David Tennant, but after Christopher Eccleston."
"1406"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I was in the car with Mom at this shop with all these really expensive cars in the carpark. This one car was a 'Ferrari Excel'. This lady was trying to get Mom out of the car. Then I was writing my dream down and she wanted to know about me. I didn't know what to say and was thinking about Runescape and Doctor Who. She took my dream and I was like ""Hey! Give it back!""."
"1407"	"(2007-07-19 (16)) I saw Porky and she was still alive. I was like ""I love you!""."
"1408"	"(2007-07-20 (16)) Mom, Ezra and I were in the car. Mom went to this house and this girl came out. She gave her smokes and the girl called out to her brother to pay for them. Her brother was Eugene. He saw me, but said his name was Bill. I was asking Mom why she was giving kids smokes. We went to this shop. Clayton and a made-up sister of his were there. I wanted a Yogo. We left and this guy on the road was using a trolley thing as transport. It went backwards and he was almost hit."
"1409"	"(2007-07-20 (16)) I was at 'home'. Ezra and some random guys were there. They were playing some trivia game that was a special feature for some movie. We were watching bloopers and stuff too."
"1410"	"(2007-07-21 (16)) I went to Midvale for some excursion type of thing. There was a teacher called Ms Clarke. I was with a group of girls and it was a sport activity and we were making up rules and throwing a pillow and getting points. Then we were talking. The teacher was complaining about me. She also said that I must be doing better without Derrick and I was like ""Who is that?"". I went home. The next day, I got home and I realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went back and searched everywhere. I found my DS, iPod and a Rayman game for the DS and another DS game. I realized my bag had been stolen. I somehow got into home and called Mom. We called my phone and this guy answered. He said that it was his girlfriend's phone. He asked me what the number was and I said ""040440440, sorry, 38"". He thought that I lied because I sounded nervous and I said ""Well, I just had... stolen"". I smashed Ms Clarke's car and burnt her house and got my stuff. I was at Mom's and the table was outside. I was on my laptop. There was this program thing where you can change a movie character to a person or something. I got Grimani from Casanova. I was like ""What the hell do I want him for?! I want David Tennant!""."
"1411"	"(2007-07-21 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who, but all I remember was David Tennant screaming."

"1414"	"(2007-07-23 (16)) I was watching Doctor Who, but then it was Firefly. There was a castle thing and it had these smoke clouds. I was telling someone that this was like another episode of their show. I don't remember it properly, but Wash and Book were caught. Zoe wasn't happy. I remember Mal, Kaylee, Simon and Jayne were around too. The creatures were gargoyle like."

I was watching The Fast Show and there was something about utopia. I was also looking at something about Young Bond. I was thinking of Paul Whitehouse. We had an excursion. I was on the same bus as Ezra. Clayton was in front of me. Ezra and Clayton had chips and I was eating them too. It was our first excursion together. Calvin wasn't on the bus. Some of the street names were Impressive and Screenplay. Mom and Darren went to the US for some wine thing. They didn't want to stay the night."
"1417"	"(2007-07-26 (16)) Some time traveling people were after me. There was an old lady. David Tennant was unlocking this door (I had run out at one stage and then had run back in) and I locked it again. I, or someone, killed the old lady and put her in this air thing. David Tennant came out. There were these things which flew into your mouth, 'rape' you and give you a funny feeling in your stomach and then you die. I think I was an alien. Whoever had them made a compromise with me and would take me instead of killing me or something. They had these strips to track people. There was also this cool TOM-TOM thing and I was looking for Eugene. It said that he was in 'Spaceman' which was a suburb or a street."
"1418"	"(2007-07-28 (16)) I was finding out stuff from when I was younger. Some teacher bloke pulled out this big sheet of paper. It had love hearts and Eugene written all over it and there was lots of sticky tape. I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. I said that it wasn't mine, but a friend of mine's. I asked how he got it. I thought I'd done it in 2002, but it was made in 2001."

People kept going weird and trying to kill me (including Clayton and Samantha). I ran to a deli. Samantha was there and ordered a ""mint tableau"". I got some thing and I needed to get a drink to get water. They only had coffee and I had a look for Choc Milk, but they didn't have any. No-one wanted a drink. Eugene was there."
"1424"	"(2007-07-29 (16)) These aliens were from a planet with no emotion and looked like humans. I didn't believe them. At first, there was one, then there were a few. I did this thing to make a portal, but it didn't work. This guy and his friend tried to kill me with these big rocks. I threw them back. One hit the guy and bounced off him and hit the other guy. They were rapists too. Elijah was there. There were lots of houses and I was walking down the street. I was calling ""Eugene!"" because I thought that he'd been with me earlier. I went to this place which was where I worked, and it was creepy."

Someone was saying how there was nothing to steal, but I was still worried about people being there. There was some scanner thing, which said there were more people than us in the house. We were checking the rooms. I checked the bathroom and the mirror cabinet. Mom was there."
"1427"	"(2007-07-31 (16)) I was at 'school'. I asked Mr Stevenson if I could go to the toilet. I got my hair straightener and Josephine went with me. The toilets were like ashtrays and there were no doors, so I went back. The lady said ""Are you finished in the 30's?"". She said that I had diabetes according to some blood test thing. My score was 26.12. She said ""three shots of insulin a day"". I said ""No"". Eugene was there. I was thinking that Ezra must definitely have diabetes."

Ms Pascal was around and she walked off. Mr Reilly was doing something about leaves. These black people had balls and were throwing them at us. We threw them back. We were joking about Evelyn and Darius. I threw a water bottle and it went over three of them. One was white with really brown eyes. Someone opened this door and there was a time 'vortex'. They closed it. The black people went to sleep. We went through the vortex and landed in a wrestling match."
"1431"	"(2007-08-02 (16)) I was watching The Waterboy [it keeps being on Foxtel] . Kevin Costner was in it. There was a big thing about racism because this black guy was the bad guy in it and he killed a French girl. Dad said they were ""glorifying blacks"". Mom was around."
"1432"	"(2007-08-02 (16)) I was sorting the dollhouse out. I found Bottom DVD's and Rik Mayall was on the front."
"1433"	"(2007-08-03 (16)) This girl had a movie/TV show based on her autobiography. When she was little, she and her brother were friends with this guy. When she got older she liked him. As an adult she went over to his house and he was a doctor. She asked him if he ever kissed his patients and he said ""Sometimes"". Then she said ""And sex?"" and he said sometimes. She said something else and they went to kiss each other, but he pulled away and said he couldn't do that because she was married and it wasn't fair to her husband."
"1434"	"(2007-08-03 (16)) I was at school and I was watching Eugene's car. Mom parked far away and we left at a time where we'd be behind his car, but we were in front. Then another car was behind us and I was like 'damn!'."
"1435"	"(2007-08-03 (16)) There were zombies. This guy had a tractor and another guy told him to drive somewhere safe and he said no."
"1436"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) Some guy got hit by a car. This little girl was talking to me and she was seven years old. She said ""I like math and love Leo""."
"1437"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) I was at school and I saw Eugene there."
"1438"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) I was watching the first episode of Sliders and it was totally different. Steve Guttenberg and Katherine Heigl were in it. It was set in a space ship and they would randomly travel in time or space. In real life, I got this package and it was makeup. Dad and I were like ""What the hell?"". There were clothes as well, including some blue pants and some weird string thing."
"1439"	"(2007-08-04 (16)) I asked Mom to get me a water bottle and to fill it up from the fridge. Dad was there."
"1440"	"(2007-08-05 (16)) Some kid was on the radio. He had wrapped a cylinder of textas in glad wrap and I was thinking that they would contact him again in ten years. Then, that had happened fifteen years ago or something and they brought him back. Mom and I went to the beach, then I decided I didn't want to. We had an exercise ball with us. She wanted to stay. She said something about Ezra. I saw Darius on the beach. We were walking near these buildings. Then I was someone else and my parents were dead. I saw Calvin. I said that I must've been adopted. These radio people met with me. There was a guy and a girl and a guy my age. The radio guy signed the guy's letter, and the girl signed mine. I was talking with them on the radio and we were sitting on opposite sides of this booth thing. There were lots of buttons. I was talking about Robbie Williams who I was friends with. I was saying how everyone says he's a ""sex God"". I was saying that we don't hang out much because I liked being alone, but we would watch movies together sometimes. There were lots of rows of CD's. There was a laptop."
"1441"	"(2007-08-05 (16)) This lady was a painter. She was blind. She wanted to go to the beach to paint, but everyone was like ""Why? You're blind"". She could tell the future."
"1442"	"(2007-08-05 (16)) I was at a shop. This guy was pretending that he thought that I was a guy. I pretended to pull out a penis. There was a fight, and he ran and hid in the fridge. He liked me. I put an apricot chicken dinner in the microwave."
"1443"	"(2007-08-06 (16)) This dream jumps around a lot, but I was in an alternate universe. I was given prescription medicine in pill form, which was opium, but they were smokes. Calvin was talking about Genevieve touching him and something about bandages. Mom straightened half of my hair. I was at school and realized about my hair. I saw Granma and she wouldn't call Mom. I started walking on the grassed area near senior school. Someone told me Dmitri liked me and wanted to go out with me. I said that I didn't and a bird pooped on my head. I saw Dmitri walking down the corridor. I was at home and then I called Mom. I went to this other universe. Then I was me and alternate me was with me. She would disappear in seven months. There was this big vacuum thing sucking everything. I couldn't get out of the way, but I managed to. These others and I were trapped in this box. We were getting out and there were these time capsules in there. We all got up except for Julian Sands, because if he went to get him we would fall in. He wrote his last dream down and gave it to me."
"1444"	"(2007-08-06 (16)) I was at home and I saw a burglar out the back so I banged on the window to scare him off. He saw me and I realized he was going to come in. Ezra went to the laundry and I went to my room and music was playing. Later, I went out armed with a fork. I stabbed Dad by mistake. Ezra was at the hospital and he had been stabbed in the arm. I called the ambulance and Ezra wanted to confirm it was me talking, by asking me about some story about a swing at Nana's. Dad's laptop was still there. There was something about Valerie and Precious and Tinkerbell."
"1445"	"(2007-08-07 (16)) Eugene was on the computer. He was on a site and we both had an account and I told him to add me as a friend. His name was Splatter. I went home and went on the site to find out information about him. My avatar was something to do with The Simpsons Movie. His brother Rodney had the same avatar."
"1446"	"(2007-08-07 (16)) I was at school. We had photos and I remember Jeremiah. Someone had undies with Billie Piper on them. We were going to be making a photo album video. Ms Pascal was around. Calvin wanted to do one of Dumbledore (Harry Potter). Samantha and someone were sitting near me. Calvin wanted Genevieve in our group."
"1447"	"(2007-08-08 (16)) Ezra, Mom and I went to this place for bowling. First it was Dad in the car and I forgot my shoes and he was complaining. There was a pool outside the place. I saw Darius and I was like ""Oh my God! Evelyn's man!"". I was thinking ""I have to tell Calvin this!"". I tripped over and was like ""Flip! Bollocks!"". Darius followed us. Inside, it was museum like and I recognized it. We'd been there before and I was thinking that I'd dreamt about it before. There was an art exhibition and then it was excursion. Eugene was there. We were getting put into groups. On this piece of paper it had Simba, me, Thuy, Elijah and Eugene in a group. Me and Eugene's details were mixed up -- his address was my address etc. We went off in our group. Eugene and Thuy were hanging together. Eugene had a lemon and he spat it out. I dropped a knife and Elijah laughed at me. Someone asked me if there was anyone in the room that I hadn't talked about. There wasn't. There was a book with lots of drawings."
"1448"	"(2007-08-09 (16)) I was at school and in the Intro Calc classroom. We had to run out of the class at random times. I changed seats and was next to Eugene, by accident. The seat was the desk behind Autumn's usual seat. We had a test of how we'd survive in certain situations. My scenario was a jumper which was 101.3°C. Later, I was walking behind Eugene and Bradley and I or someone said something and Bradley laughed. Darius was there. I or someone passed out."
"1449"	"(2007-08-09 (16)) Mom and I were on this rollercoaster. I think it was a game and she kept falling off at the end."
"1450"	"(2007-08-10 (16)) This container thing was in space and 'fell' into this gravity thing which suspended it. This guy checked it and then turned it over and the gravity changed and it floated down to Earth. This alien thing was around. Some guy who looked like Jason Patric was there too. I was at school and I sat with Elana, then I was wondering why I was sitting with her and went over to the bench. A bunch of boys were near by and they were throwing ice-cream. Someone called out ""Calvin"". The boys left. Mr Willingham told them off. We were hiding out and Eugene kept hiding out. We were hiding because it was the end of the world or something."
"1451"	"(2007-08-10 (16)) Some kids got to school to start filming for a movie, myself included. Only a few people did. Later, we found out that there was going to be an assembly. Ms Solomon said ""... couldn't do this next year!"". I was next to Daryl and his hand was on my leg and I didn't feel weird. We got called to the assembly and the class got attacked. We ran into this assembly place which had two entrances at the top and then these steps went all the way across and continued down (like a cinema, without chairs). Then it was somewhere else and there was this alien guy called Arthur. He went yellow and his face was big. This lady nurse/receptionist got scared by him. The doctor came and was trying to help it. There was a photo of what Arthur looked like normally and we were descendents of him."
"1452"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I was in a shop and this bad guy (who was a girl) was trying to kill me and so I was trying to do the same to her, but she was really fast and always dodged the bullets. I was thinking that she had that thing which made you go a few seconds ahead of everyone else (like in Flesh and Blood). When you selected a gun it was like a game and there was a touch screen panel. I got this firecracker type of gun, but I was still missing her. The top of the gun fell off and it had tubes in it (like the lolly things at Seabird). The gun was red. I was running out and I realized that she was going to blow up the shop. I saw Elijah and Theodore standing out side and I told them to run and follow me. I got into this car, which was actually a spaceship. Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were in there. I was friends with them. Dmitri couldn't drive well on the road. Elijah was like ""What's the ship called"" and they said ""Serenity"". There was an intro video of Dmitri and some girl he liked and they were painted green."
"1453"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I went to Mom's and we were eating dinner. Ezra wanted to leave and Dad was there. I was watching a movie and it had one hour to go. Mom was getting dirty clothes, but she was just grabbing random stuff, so I told her I'd do it myself. She took my Dada shirt."
"1454"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) Some black kid and his father were really fast. It was a TV show. The kid was talking to the bad guy and said ""leave Dad alone"". The guy kidnapped the kid and he was talking to the Dad who he could see on this screen. He said the kid could see him and his mother was like ""he can't see anything"" -- the kid was blind. He was also really smart and did this hard equation in his head really quickly. This guy had to pretend that he died. He had a son who was about my age and was kind of hot. He knew that his father was alive. This girl who looked like Katherine Heigl and the son were hybrids and so they couldn't breed. The 'dead' guy's wife called the son and she didn't know the guy was alive."
"1455"	"(2007-08-11 (16)) I was at school. I had to go to the toilet and was trying to find it. The school was huge and completely different. I went to Ms Corbett's classroom, which was supposed to have stairs in it to go to the toilet."
"1456"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) Elijah was staying over or something. We were all in the car and we were in the backseat and Mom was driving. I said ""I made a gift for you today good Proctor"" and he said ""Why thank you, it is a fair poppet"". I was laughing and said ""That damn poppet""."
"1457"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was watching some play, which I think was A Streetcar Named Desire. Marlon Brando was in it. Dad called out ""Eugene!"" and I was like ""What the hell?"". Then it was this movie and some girl said that Ava Gardner and Cary Grant were in it. Then she said that was wrong and it was Marlon Brando, Janet Leigh and some made-up guy called Chuck Morris."
"1458"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was watching some video from 1338 and Einstein was in it. I was like 'eh?'. I concluded it was because some people had traveled in time."
"1459"	"(2007-08-12 (16)) I was looking at who lives in each house on Casserley Ave, like it was on a computer. David Tennant and Christopher Eccleston both lived on there. I was looking for Eugene. I was like ""You live on the same street as David Tennant and Christopher Eccleston?!"""
"1460"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) I was at school and I was going to form. To get to mine you had to walk through this glass. Eugene was in my form. He got to the other side of the glass. His group didn't know how to get through. I said ""just walk through to the magic land"" and Eugene said the same thing and laughed. Some game for the DS was shown on this computer screen. I was making an account. I made my username FancyFire. Elijah was waiting. There was a quiz to see how gay you were. There was a cave in the game and it would open at 5:30-6:30pm for contact. These animals on the walls of the cave would come to life."
"1461"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) I had an Accounting test. Dad asked if my notes were enough. Dad and Mom were both like ""You should have studied""."
"1462"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) Some woman (sometimes me) had a baby and discovered something. She was trying to lose weight for a photo shoot."
"1463"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) There was something about Rihanna and Dad said that he thought she was hot and I was like ""Ew! She's feral and looks like a monkey!"". Mom was there."
"1464"	"(2007-08-13 (16)) I was watching some movie with Timothy Olyphant and Josh Duhamel. I was trying to work out which was which. I could tell because Timothy Olyphant had a mole under his eye."
"1465"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) I was at home by myself and I was worried that someone was going to try and break in. I tried to call Mom."
"1466"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) There were 28 Days Later... type of zombies. I got infected but I was immune and my eyes went weird like in 28 Weeks Later. I went outside and the zombies tried to get me and I was like ""get off me!""."
"1467"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) We had a relief teacher lady for Physics and Chemistry. I remember seeing Autumn, Jeremiah and Eugene. No-one liked her and when Mr Reilly came back we were all like ""Yay!""."
"1468"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) I was at Mom's new house. It was different and I had a bunk bed with a double bed underneath. This girl was sleeping over on the bottom. I was thinking that I'd take the bottom soon. There was a fan and light right above the bunk. I was really hot. I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge and Mom and I were trying to get cool. She was cooking."
"1469"	"(2007-08-14 (16)) I went to some shop place. There was this trial thing outside where you can get a couple million points and then cash them in. We had to look for some picture to get points. I wanted to join, but you had to have a shower, and the girls shower was on display, but not the guys. I really wanted to join, but refused to shower. Eventually, the lady let me look inside. There was a clothes section and all the clothes were too small. Ezra was there. She said that I didn't have to shower. I also remembered that Dad's Medicare card was at home."
"1470"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) I was at 'school' in some toilets getting changed. Mr_McDowell was outside the window talking to the girls. I realized that the cubicle wasn't fully closed. Calvin was talking to me earlier. The teacher came in and I quickly covered myself and he asked me why I was getting changed in there. I was looking for somewhere else to get changed."
"1471"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) I was downloading a movie. I went to Mom's and was downloading it there and I was getting 100kb/s. At home, I was only getting 20kb/s. Darren was complaining."
"1472"	"(2007-08-15 (16)) We were leaving for school in ten minutes. Dad had to work. Mom and Ezra were there. I had to straighten my hair, so I said that I'd get Mom to take me late. I wanted to not go though, because of a Chemistry test and I was thinking I could get her to pick me up before Physics, but decided that it was pointless and I wanted to practice the English play with Elijah and Theodore."
"1473"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I was at Nana's. I was walking around to go through Poppers's door. I saw a goose, it hissed, so I ran and it chased me. I had to jump over the ramp to down and I got stuck at the fish pond and it got me. It was pecking me and then heaps of others started to. Poppa and others tried to get them off but they couldn't. They had to kill them and I closed my eyes. They were then sinking in the fish pond. They got the rest off me and my leg hurt and I tried to run to the door. Someone said I'd never be able to run again. I went out later and I saw goose walking around so I ran back in."
"1474"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I went out the back and a bloke next door asked me to read a book. He said to pick a colour -- red or orange. I saw that orange was Harry Potter and because I don't like orange I chose red. It was Noah's Ark. He told me to read it and give a speech ""next Friday"". I was thinking 'Meh, this is just a dream'."
"1475"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I got a haircut. Mom was getting me food and I'd only been up for one hour. She wanted to get me Hungry Jack's."
"1476"	"(2007-08-16 (16)) I was watching a movie. Some people were looking for some other people. This girl escaped through a vent and was hiding in this secret room. There was a pram in there. She 'slid' down the wall."
"1477"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) Mom was pregnant; sometimes she was at the start of the pregnancy, but sometimes at the end. The hospital was at school. Dmitri walked passed the window in Mom's room and Mom was looking and then she reckoned that I liked him. Calvin said that this scary lady was his mother, and I was like ""No, it isn't!"" and then she was like ""Hey, Calvin!"". I had left a message to everyone to tell Ezra about Mom and Eugene had gotten it first. Theodore was playing some game called Jacks and Randall. He was dressed as Jacks. There were aliens."
"1478"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) We were driving home and Eugene was behind us. I turned to look at him. Then we were driving backwards, and his father Abraham looked good-looking. Rodney was in the front. I was looking at Eugene and he saw me and was looking at me. I couldn't stop looking and I Can't Stop Loving You came on the radio."
"1479"	"(2007-08-17 (16)) There were aliens at school. We all had guns and stuff, but we were shooting at each other. Some girl realized that I was good at killing people so she showed me where extra ammo was. Those honkey nut things were the ammo. They acted like a plunger and didn't work that well. Evelyn and this girl were together. Evelyn jumped out of this window then they both went under a car. I lifted the car to help them. Evelyn ran and she was fast but she fell over. We had to blow up some hotel and this room somewhere to kill all the aliens. These people in the hotel all had the same look and room and they had cats and hats."
"1480"	"(2007-08-18 (16)) Mom wanted me to do some trick. There was a swamp thing out the back with an elephant in it. Its back was sticking out. I had to slide off it and go over this fence. I had a suspicion that it wasn't an elephant but a huge tiger or deer. After saying no over and over, I did it, but it wasn't an elephant -- it was a dinosaur. I was on its back and it stood up and was really tall and had a cone on its head. Ezra and I were stuck up high and Mom was down below trying to help us with a cardboard box. I told her to get rope and a better box. I thought that I head Eugene's voice and I could see over the fence, but it was that Salim guy."
"1481"	"(2007-08-18 (16)) We had two kittens. One had really nice brown, black and white markings. I had called it Eugene. But I decided not to call it that, because it wasn't mine, but Mom's. I was talking about it and called it Cornetto. Uncle Wilbur had called it that."
"1482"	"(2007-08-19 (16)) Our house was creepy and we had maids and stuff. They turned evil. I wanted to get inside to get my stuff. We were running away and it was really dark. The lighting, though, looked strange like a dream, so I did a reality check and it worked. I was wishing for Eugene, but it wasn't working, so I yelled out ""Eugene!"", but nothing happened."
"1483"	"(2007-08-19 (16)) I was at school and we were making stuff with pipes. Theodore gave me some extra things and told me how good drugs were. Dad picked me up and we had to push the car and I was on a mattress. We got to a traffic light. I had to go back to school to pack away. There was an Asian gardener there and he didn't understand me. There was a shop at school and it had Pokedex's and Tamagotchi's. Mom said ""not as good as Anastasia's"" and I was like ""What?! She has a Pokedex?!"" I was washing these pipes and this yucky stuff came out of the top of them."
"1484"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) Calvin and I were at this crime scene. There was a fake skeleton there in the place of the body. There was some shoe that had something to do with Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). Zombies of some sort were around. There was a table which had names of dead people on there. Mariah was there and I laughed. Then I saw Michael Palin's name and I was like ""Oh my God! No! My favourite person in the world!"". I looked for Eugene's name, but I didn't find him."
"1485"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) I was at school waiting for Mom, because I was wagging. I found out that Darren had adopted some guy called Matt Keeslar and I was thinking of Brennan and Matt Keeslar (the actor) but it wasn't either of them. They went somewhere and my phone was missing and we discovered that he had taken it. We got home and he jumped in the bin. Darren was going to bash him. Mom and I drove off and she was crying."
"1486"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) There was something about Jeff Goldblum and I was like ""Brundle Seth!""."
"1487"	"(2007-08-21 (16)) These people were coming to kill us. We were in this room. There was some guy, his mother and I. His mother hid and the guy ran out this back door and I followed him. There was this big staircase and I was like ""up or down?"" and we went up. There was a bed there and we turned off the lights and they didn't find us. I think someone had died and come back to life."
"1488"	"(2007-08-22 (16)) I was on the net reading something. Someone said they thought that Darius was gay. I was wondering whether it was Mariyam or Thuy."

"1491"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I was at school. I was sitting with some people and there was a toilet which was outside and was like a drain. Ms Pascal thought that I was friends with the people. Then she asked how many friends I had, ""eleven?"" and I said ""Two, Calvin and Evelyn"" and she was like ""How did you manage that?"". I was telling Calvin later. He thought that the person I liked had a 'J' in their name. I was thinking 'Daryl, Dmitri and Eugene don't have a J!'."
"1492"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I was somewhere and I was perving on Eugene. I was worried that his friends would see me looking."

"1494"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) Calvin, Ezra and I were walking to school. Then Ezra and I were in a car and we drove off this little cliff. It showed Calvin's face and it took a while for this red Ute to fall on the car. Ezra and I got out and hurried away. Then it was a movie with Drake Bell. These cars were coming after him. He was at a gym and there was a car at the door trying to get in. He threw a barbell to stop the door from opening. The gym was closed that day. Someone wanted to do pushups."
"1495"	"(2007-08-23 (16)) I don't know where I was, but Nana and Ezra were there. Someone said something a ""little bike"" and ""ice-cream"". I called Dad and he got something that was Nike. The lighting was bad."

You were also supposed to 'see' Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). I didn't. Calvin and Samantha were there. There was another one where you jump onto this seesaw thing and you get to the other side with a skateboard. Brennan kept hitting his head. Autumn tried it. Someone said something about Hey Ya."
"1497"	"(2007-08-24 (16)) Autumn was playing Pokemon and it was lagging heaps because the internet was slow. I was at her house. Her father was supposed to pick up Dad. She disappeared and returned minutes or hours later. She was at a table and then she went to the toilet. Dad was watching Boston Legal and I watched a little bit because James Spader was in it."
"1498"	"(2007-08-24 (16)) We were in some building. This guy went into some woman's room and took a piece of paper. I saw him and I went to him. I had done the same thing earlier. We started up this group thing and this guy came to join. The guy I was with knew he was a scammer and told me not to let him in. There was a big group of people, including Elijah and Evelyn who wanted to join. It cost $18.95 a year. You had to give a word to join. Some of the words were ""jar park"" and ""singing happy"". I was looking at screen shots for some movie and Jerry O'Connell was in it."
"1499"	"(2007-08-25 (16)) I was at a shop. Mom gave me and Ezra these Bopo cards and he bought this stingy doodler thing. I told him not to. This song started playing and I started singing Eye in the Sky and I realized it was that song playing. This lady was selling cats, but she was about to leave. There was a black one except it was yellow, who was like Spaceman. I got that cat."
"1500"	"(2007-08-25 (16)) I was on Payton's MySpace. He had this thing which said that he loved some guy called ""Michael Paglin"". I was looking at photos and realized it was Michael Palin. He was fully obsessed with him and I was like ""What the hell?""."
"1501"	"(2007-08-26 (16)) Mom was living with Darren, but was going out with her brother. They didn't think anything of it, but knew that it was wrong. Ezra was there. She was worried about having photos that reminded them that they were related."

"1504"	"(2007-08-28 (16)) I was on a computer and Eugene was next to me. We were all signing up with this site. Bradley finished and I was looking at his profile. I had put my birthday as 1986 and I was thinking that Bradley was fifteen years older. Then I realized my mistake. I first thought that I was 12 and he was 17. Eugene was watching me. There was a quote section and Bradley's had ""Izzy!"" and there were lots about me. I was thinking 'Great, they have a stupid nickname to diss me with'."

Someone realized that the room was going to blow up. Later, I walked back down to the room. Evelyn, Darius, Eugene, Elana and I were trapped in this room and these people wouldn't let us out and we were locked in. I was telling Calvin later. There was a flashback of some room. These people came in and were going to spray paint a cupboard. Then it was back to us and the door blew and had killed two people and we were laughing. We got out and it looked like West Whitehall Primary School. There was a hot dog stand and the sausages were in water."
"1508"	"(2007-08-30 (16)) Ezra was after me. I jumped from all these places out the back and I was at the pool. Ezra was asking Clayton where I was and Ezra caught up to me."
"1509"	"(2007-08-30 (16)) I was watching a movie and the executive producer was ""Clayton Kirney"". I was like ""That's like Clayton!""."
"1510"	"(2007-08-31 (16)) I was at school and it was period 4. I realized that I had no shoes on. Calvin and I went to a car and Genevieve came and they hugged for ages. Then he drove me home. When I got 'home', it was another class and Eugene, Jeremiah and Darius were there. So we decided to wag. I was thinking that I only had Biology next. I had a video camera and was leaving it on the desk, filming, aimed at Eugene. He put a chip on his nose and it got hot so he took it off. I had won some movie competition in October (it was November now) and I didn't know that I had. Jeremiah said to someone ""too bad"". Eugene had won this month. Then we were somewhere else. Mr Stevenson asked where we were period 4. He knew we wagged and we had suspension. Jemma was there. I moved seats and was a few rows behind Eugene and I couldn't perve properly."
"1511"	"(2007-08-31 (16)) Some director guy was walking down a street. There was a Festen St, and I was like ""I love Festen!"". He liked it too. There was a little rack of movies and he wanted Ichi the Killer. I went looking for it. There was a new Nintendo 64 and it was faster and would play all the old games. Dad was there and there was a bus."
"1512"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at some place where some people had died before. It was haunted or something. First, we were sitting at desks. Eugene sat at the one next to me. Later, some girl and guy went into this plant place and she got taken by the plants, but he didn't see it."
"1513"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at home and something happened to my room. My bed was at my window. Dad said that nineteen things had disappeared so if I saw anything weird I should tell him. I saw a gnome and some other things and Dad came and got them. Then he saw a hand in the air conditioner and the vents were closing. I asked if he wanted a torch but he said no and I said that it was a gay torch anyway."
"1514"	"(2007-09-01 (16)) I was at the Midvale shops. I scared some little kid and his mother. I had to get something about of this car. It was Michael Palin's car and he gave me the key and I could guess what each key was for. He had six kids and one was called Treasure. There was a grabbing machine and a weird kid was there. I said ""I want that one, it's cool"" and he said ""That's why I'm going for it"". He got it and gave it to me. Then I was in the car and there were lots of seats. Ezra was friends with these two black rappers. We went to Nana's. I lost my diary and Mom and I were looking for it. Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there too. I found my diary in my own bag."
"1515"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) I was discussing something with someone. I said that Dreamcatcher had three hot guys in it (Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant and Thomas Jane), two especially."
"1516"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) There were vampires or zombies or something. I was hiding under a blanket peeking out the window. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were coming up an escalator. Granma was a vampire and Uncle Gabriel was a werewolf. Uncle Gabriel turned into a werewolf and then I did. We both climbed up this pole and he scratched me. I realized it was a dream and tried to get away. Then I was somewhere else. I wished for Eugene, but nothing happened. I went to a shop and I knew it was a dream, but I couldn't control it."
"1517"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) Dad picked a couple of things off my floor and then it was clean. I was relieved that I didn't have to do it now. I was thinking if it was that easy then I would've done it myself."
"1518"	"(2007-09-04 (16)) I had done some math thing in Year 9 that I'd forgotten about and I'd done it on SIDE. I had Biology, and I got a booklet about plants. I got this book out called 'Stomata'. Mathea would have a certain book out and then we would swap. Ms Olmstead was there."
"1519"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) I told Dad that I was an alien and he was really angry. Ezra and Dad started building a cage to keep me in."
"1520"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) Some others and I had powers. People were trying to kill us and we were at Mom's old house. I changed the stairs so the others couldn't come up. Later, other people came. I had a Band-Aid on my second finger on my right hand. I was planning my escape and imagining different scenarios. I pretended to jump off the balcony. Alejandro walked near where I was hiding and I ran out and jumped onto this platform and tried to get out of the door. The door was locked. Eugene was there too. He was talking to me and decided that I had no powers. This Chinese girl was hiding from some bad guys. There was this joker guy with powers and looked like Jay Kay. This guy was saying something about Jamiriquai, and Jay Kay wasn't in it. Someone said that his name was Jason Cheetham, and then someone said that Jamiriquai was someone else."
"1521"	"(2007-09-05 (16)) I was at a shop. Payton and Selena went to the toilet. Samantha asked where they were. Before, Ezra and I were talking and I said something funny. I heard a lady telling her son that he should go out with me. He reminded me of Daryl and I sat across from him at this long table."
"1522"	"(2007-09-06 (16)) I was at this library place. I was trying to decide what movie to watch. When I got home some of the movies were different. Mulholland Dr. was one of them. Calvin was around. I had this Little Britain DVD and Andy was on the front. We were going to watch something. Ezra had three dogs. Mom bought them all last week. I had known about the first one and I said that I wanted a dog and she said we'd go to the shop tomorrow, which was a Thursday. People were performing plays at this theater and we could perform ours in front of all these people. Evelyn sat next to me on this lounge and I was telling her about the dogs. Calvin sat down and Genevieve was trying to get him to leave."
"1523"	"(2007-09-06 (16)) I was at some place and Darius and Eugene were there. Darius was being annoying."

"1528"	"(2007-09-08 (16)) I was watching this Fear Factor type of show and I wanted to do it (at home), so I did the next thing which was to eat some pig foot. It was really disgusting but I ate it in time. The next thing was a ""rotten, spoiled egg"" and I was going to do it, but decided that I couldn't be bothered."
"1529"	"(2007-09-08 (16)) We were going to space. There was a little red bit floating in space that looked like fire, but it was actually some liquid which imploded."
"1530"	"(2007-09-08 (16)) Ezra was watching some cartoon of a sleepover thing and they were playing truth or dare. I was going to take a photo of him watching it, but then it finished."
"1531"	"(2007-09-09 (16)) I couldn't control myself and I ended up miles away. At one point I was driving a car and I was going everywhere and really fast. There was a tree with evil lizards. I ended up on this long road with forests on the side. I was walking along and I was naked, with a towel around me. This guy gave me food and clothes and let me sleep in his car for the night. He lived at some orphan place. When I got home I looked it up and I found 'David McDonald' (David Tennant) on there. The guy sent me a card."
"1532"	"(2007-09-09 (16)) I was at school. Elijah, Theodore and I went to film our play, but remembered that we were editing. Ms Solomon wrote us a note."

"1534"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) I was watching some reality show. It had Jack Nicholson in it. He and this black guy were going to fight, but I think the black guy broke his hand. I was thinking that Jack Nicholson looked hot. He said some cleaner had told his fortune and it said ""you're associable... with children. You like the greener room""."
"1535"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) I wrote a story which was Naked Lunch 2. Mom took me to Dad and I asked him to type it up for me. It was only 133 words (but not really). I was talking to David Lynch later, and I was going to tell him about it, but then remembered that it was David Cronenberg that did Naked Lunch. I almost tripped downstairs. I was thinking that it was my NaNoWriMo novel, but then I remembered that I was doing Battle Royale and it wasn't November."
"1536"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) I was at home. My bed was going out to the door. I had some old school stuff of Ezra's under my mattress. This thing he'd written said ""sad to leave school"". I was mouthing Sexy, Naughty, Bitchy for some reason. Ezra came to my room."
"1537"	"(2007-09-10 (16)) These people over the other side of the country were flooding cities to get rid of ""one cobra"". Darren and Mom were around. Cuddles had a gigantic flea. Ezra threatened me with a cockroach."
"1538"	"(2007-09-11 (16)) I was outside a shop. Rodney kept getting attacked by a dog. I was walking and Rodney and I both reached his house then the dog attacked him and I went inside. He ran and hid in his bedroom and I hid in another. I thought that it was Eugene's, but a sign said ""Goren"" and I realized that that was Darius's brother. I left the room when the dog wasn't in sight and ran to the room next to Rodney's, which was Eugene's. Then Rodney was Ezra and the room was made of pillows. They were 'turning' into strawberries. Later I was at school and Evelyn was around. I wanted to go to a house, but she didn't."
"1539"	"(2007-09-11 (16)) I was at school and was watching heaps of movie previews. I wrote something on this piece of paper. Later, mine and Eugene's were next to each other. Eugene had written something on his page at the same spot, with similar writing. Jeremiah pointed it out and said ""Why have you got something written there too?"". I said that something was gay and Eugene laughed."
"1540"	"(2007-09-11 (16)) Mom was a sort of haemophiliac. Next month I was maybe going to get my period and I told Samantha so she could ""come prepared"". This sprinkler came on and I said that would've been cool if 'we were in this one and you were a hot guy'."
"1541"	"(2007-09-12 (16)) I went back in time to when I was in pre-primary. I went back and was actually myself at that age. I still had my memory though. I was doing extremely well in all the work, even more so than I did the first time. I asked where people were on September 11, then remembered that hadn't happened yet. This teacher was going to make us read this book out one at a time. I hesitated and some other girl got made to do it first. Then I remembered it had happened before and I realized that stuff would stay the same even if I didn't do them, ie, I was worried about having to redo all of Runescape, but it was going to happen even without me playing. Evelyn was there and she wanted to talk on my mobile. I said they were banned and she said they weren't. I pulled it out and it was this big brick thing and I was saying how my real one was much smaller. I didn't let her use it. Someone was handing out work and Raquel was there. Some guy was called Eugene, but it was spelt ""Micheal"". I was then thinking about Eugene. It was then Year 8 and I was at Brookland. I saw Eugene and he was in the senior school uniform. He was talking to Autumn and Alejandro. Autumn jumped on Alejandro. This teacher told me to smile, as did these two guys. She said that was why I had no friends. I was doing really well at school."
"1542"	"(2007-09-12 (16)) Calvin was playing with Autumn somewhere."
"1543"	"(2007-09-12 (16)) I was at a shop with Mom and Ezra, but that's all I remember."
"1544"	"(2007-09-13 (16)) Calvin was some 'nice' kid. His parents were real goody-goody's and they helped out all these people. Silas turned into some sort of demon. I called Calvin and Silas's face was all scratched up and red."
"1545"	"(2007-09-13 (16)) I was at school. Rebekah and her whole family were dentists. Genevieve, Jemma and Rebekah were sitting near the PAC and we were sitting around from the Accounting classroom. They asked me to sit with them (they were joking). Calvin was sitting with me. I called Genevieve a ""stupid prostitute ho"". I was doing Biology work. I complained to them that they didn't have to study because they were doing the easy subjects. Later, I had a sore tooth, which had been sore for ages. Some teacher, who I think was Ms Solomon, was painting people's faces. The only dentist was Rebekah (she had dentist skill). She was saying something about a ""mass of breast"". A teacher said that I had to trust her. Then I was in a science classroom and we had a seating plan. Eugene was in the row next to me. They passed around a didgeridoo and Eugene liked it."
"1546"	"(2007-09-14 (16)) I was lining up for Intro Calc. Eugene and Darius were there. Some kid got scared of Darius because his arms were really hairy. Eugene had a Doctor Who like coat on and he looked really hot, so I got my phone out to take a photo, but Mr Haynes came. This girl was attached to the hip of her sister. The hosts came to our class."
"1547"	"(2007-09-14 (16)) We were leaving the school. I got to the car, but then Mom lagged and we ended up behind Eugene's car, but then a car appeared in front of us."
"1548"	"(2007-09-15 (16)) I was at school. I was walking and Evelyn was with me. We were near a fence near where we get dropped off. Some kids were making fun of Evelyn and then me. I turned to them and one said something and he had an accent (like in The Green Mile) and I was mocking him. Elijah was there and he thought it was funny. I asked Elijah if he was writing a book and if he had a plan. My book had to have Yvonne (Jessica Stevenson) in it. At lunch, Eugene was nearby. There was a video of Alejandro and he said ""I'm Alejandro, Nigee, Nejee, Nijiee""."
"1549"	"(2007-09-15 (16)) We were hiding somewhere. This person got killed. This guy went out to war with them. They caught us with this tracking device."
"1550"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I was at this shop. I was a prisoner and I had to go with this cop. We were near an exit and when he turned away, I walked out. There was a guy in a car trying to get me. He got out and I jumped out and he did as well. I was half hanging out. He kept spraying some sleeping gas. This other guy tried to stop us, but he fell asleep. The guy spraying the gas got tired and I pushed him out of the car. I drove out and I was at the back of Nana's. The gate leading to the backyard was just a wall, so I ran to the normal back door. Nana greeted me and I said ""This is a boring dream"". Nana was like ""huh?"" and I thought 'Oh, I must've woken up'. Something happened and I had to call these people. I had to rewrite their numbers and I asked for the piece of paper. Eugene's number was on the list and I was like 'yay'. Samantha was there. That Acquaintance-M-05 guy gave me a typewriter. I was at the front of Nana's. Calvin was there. The geese came and I jumped over the fence. Calvin did a flip over. This girl got hit by a truck. I was talking to her father about religion and he was religious."
"1551"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I was at a place that looked like home. There was a lake thing. Poppa was there. I tried to escape. Later, we had trouble turning off these lights. Eugene was there and he sounded different. They'd gotten rid of some trees on Runescape and Eugene was trying to follow me."
"1552"	"(2007-09-16 (16)) I saw kittens in the pond and I got them out just in time. It had happened once before, except the other kittens had died."
"1553"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was 'testing' out a job. It was some teacher/office thing. Basically, I did nothing and checked on this pile every so often for new stuff and then leave. I found it boring. This kid was called Wiley Wave, but was sometimes called Wiley Wiggins. I was about to write his address on his work. I found work of Hermione's (Harry Potter) and she had gotten 8/9. Mom drove to this fancy neighbourhood to meet a friend called Fat Tony or something. The house she went to had no furniture and there were lots of windows."
"1554"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was discussing how the cats out the back had had lots of kittens. We talked about Tigger, Tinkerbell and Diabla. Ezra was there. We were talking about how I was the only one who could remember all their names."
"1555"	"(2007-09-17 (16)) I was giving Mittens a bath and brushing her. She was staying still and I was surprised."
"1556"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I was in a car with Silas. We went to this shop. People from West Whitehall Primary School and stuff were there. Kaia and Tiana and some others from Whitehall High School were there. Kaia was saying about me ""Oh my God, you're so cute!"" and telling Tiana she shouldn't have ditched me. I screamed and was trying to close my door. I saw Daryl around and I hadn't seen him in a year. There was a photo of him with dreadlocks. I saw this guy and I thought he was Gavin, but he was Co-Worker-M-02 or Acquaintance-M-06. This other guy looked like Terrence. I went to the movies with Mom and Ezra. Ezra sat with Mom in this big comfy chair. I had to look around for ages to find somewhere to sit and I sat next to some woman. She put her bag on my seat. Some girl sat next to me."
"1557"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I was watching Gilligan's Island. The professor and Gilligan were there (obviously). This old lady was making a car and making some water purification thing. They needed to water some flowers for some game. I downloaded all the episodes of the latest season of Lost, then got rid of them. I had heaps of torrents going."
"1558"	"(2007-09-18 (16)) I wanted to watch a movie and opted on Pet Sematary. Dad checked outside and then I did. I got locked out. He complained because he just went out there."
"1559"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) Mom dropped me off on Casserley Ave a few houses from Eugene's, on the other side of the road. I started walking and heard Eugene and Rodney leaving the house. I realized I'd forgotten my jumper and it was on the top of the car. I grabbed it. They got in their car and I was walking in front of them. I was worried about Eugene seeing my 'fat'. Then they passed me, but they were on bikes. Eugene turned around and looked at me. He turned back but then looked at me again and almost fell off his bike. I was then at school. I went to the toilets and then left and was walking home."
"1560"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) I was watching a movie. Madonna and Bill Pullman were in it. Calvin was there. I was reading a review and Bill was giving a speech. It reminded me of something and I was deeply upset. Samantha and Payton were then around. I was playing Sims 2. I had some mod and you put your finger in pink goo, but it wasn't working."
"1561"	"(2007-09-19 (16)) I was at a computer shop with Dad. He was like ""Why not get a new computer"". I said ""Yeah, but I like my stuff"". I also didn't want Vista."
"1562"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at home. I was at the garage door and it wouldn't close and lock. Mom was trying to close it. I found some old school photos (it was next year) and I was saving them. Ezra and Evelyn were in the school photos. Granny and Uncle Wilbur were in the family room. There were photos of them and Uncle Wilbur couldn't move properly. Granny said something happened somewhere and so I went to the laundry. Then it was just Mom and I in the house. There were two black guys and they had broken the metal pipe in the door. I was trying to keep the door closed. I was trying to call Mom and the police. Then they were people from school. Alejandro and Jeremiah were there. I ended up with a weapon and was hitting them. Alejandro had his leg through a piece of wood which had FancyFire on it. Someone was chopping something. I said ""I'm surprised at you Alejandro! Why are you here?"" and he was like ""Huh? Why are you surprised at me?!"". Jeremiah asked why too. I said ""Both of you are so nice, I don't know why you're doing this!""."
"1563"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at home. Ezra and I were there alone. People were trying to break in. I was going to watch Campfire Tales but I didn't."
"1564"	"(2007-09-20 (16)) I was at 'school'. I asked this girl for a muffin and she gave one to Calvin, but not to me. I offered $5 and then she gave me heaps. I was looking for this nice thing I'd tasted before and it tasted like Venetian ice-cream, but nicer and sweeter. There was a weird banana thing. Samantha was there, cooking. Ms Powell was there and I asked her for the recipe. She said ""What are you going to do with the recipe?"" and I was like ""Uh... make them?"". This girl said her name was Hermione Granger."
"1565"	"(2007-09-21 (16)) We were messing around with water. We made this whirlpool thing and also this big puddle and we took a photo of it. Ezra was there. Then we were somewhere else. We made a big pool size whirlpool thing and the whirlpool took longer to disappear. Every time someone swam in it, they were sucked to the middle. Mr Haynes let me have my phone. Ezra took it and I said ""Don't open it!"" because I had that morphed picture of Eugene on there. Samantha went for a swim. I left, but when I came back she didn't answer me and I was thinking 'she better not be dead'. She was. She was floating upside down. I got her out and she had this mask thing on and I couldn't get it off. I blew into this phone, which blew through a hole into her mouth and was doing CPR. She started breathing but didn't wake up. I was thinking of the '101...' books and that I'd now saved a life. I was telling Mom later in the car and she was laughing. There were Indians and they were doing some Christmas thing and Christmas was on December 20th. Days later, I was on MySpace and there were all these RIP things on Samantha's MySpace. There were photos of Selena. Then it was Tiana who had died. Kaia and Classmate-F-02 had commented and there was stuff about Audrey Tautou and Ms Solomon. Samantha had a post that said that Elijah liked to be Elizabeth for The Crucible play. She asked how many kids he gave himself."
"1566"	"(2007-09-22 (16)) I had Biology, except it was in a shop. Ms Olmstead showed me the yearbook so far and I was going to ask for the photos, but I didn't. I was trying to find Eugene, but the only person that I found that I knew was Classmate-M-29. I took a lollipop and Evelyn said ""You just took a lollipop"" and I said ""No, I didn't"". She said that I did and I said that I don't eat lollipops. I tried to get rid of her by running around this shop but she kept following me. It was hard for me to run. I was pulling stuff from the shelves and throwing it behind me to make it harder for her. There was a shop exhibit thing that gave you extra flowers and I asked for extra chocolates. I hid on it, but she found me and I jumped off. I found this little car which was pretty fast. Mika was bouncing around on this ball and was singing Love Today. We ditched the ball and were hiding in sports equipment. Mika kept singing and I was hiding underneath him. I was telling him to be quiet and that ""she'll hear you"" and told him to hide with me so she didn't see me."
"1567"	"(2007-09-22 (16)) I was at school. Calvin was around. Eugene and I were going to the homework centre. I called Mom and this girl nearby said ""Why do you have to call? That's so gay"". I thought I saw Dad's car. I went to the library but we didn't have our library cards. I was thinking 'that's why you should give us a new one every year'. They gave me a new one and I didn't need the permission form to stay."
"1568"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) Ezra and I were watching Evil Dead 2. Bruce Campbell wasn't in it. I was telling Ezra it wasn't the pencil one. He wanted to do an essay on it. I said to use an ""independent drama"". Then we were in this spooky house and there was a creepy thing at the door."
"1569"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) I was somewhere and the school was there too. There were two evil people, but one was actually good. Their master had gone crazy and there were two options: let him destroy the world or kill him. They lost their power. They were running through a forest and they had a force field around it, but then it was gone. It was dark and weird at the front of the place. The people across the street couldn't see us. I was in this room and I was climbing up these stairs, but these evil people were coming so I hid behind this shelf. They came and the not-evil one came too. The good one saw me and tried not to let the evil people see. My hand was visible to them. An evil one saw it and said ""Here kitty, kitty, kitty"" and I knocked them out and ran. We were then sitting on these steps. Silas was sitting close to me and I was like 'ew, get away'. This guy pulled on my bag and I let myself fall backwards and kicked him in the head. Harlan was being gay. This guy looked like James Spader. A friend of Ezra's was sitting nearby. Dad picked us up. Ezra went in the front. It was my turn in front and I had my iPod."
"1570"	"(2007-09-23 (16)) Mom was going to make me go on a date. She decided she would take me instead. I asked her where we were going and she said ""Actually, we'll get food at home"" and I asked what food and she said pizza. I told her to take me home. She did. Dad was there. There were tapes of top music. There were some dogs somewhere and one couldn't walk."
"1571"	"(2007-09-25 (16)) I was discussing movies with Ezra. He had seen Faust and he was telling me about a movie and I said it sounded like a Stanley Kubrick movie. I was saying how I liked David Lynch and David Cronenberg too."
"1572"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) Ezra, Mom and I were at this place which was a sort of train station platform. There was water in the place where tracks would have been and it was green. I fell in, but got out. Uncle Gabriel was there too at one stage. I had some sort of disease-y type thing like vertigo. I was telling someone that I got it after watching Vertigo. Clayton was then there and we ended up at 'school'. Then we were at the platform again and the water was gone. I accidentally left my bag down there and I went to get it. There were puddles of water still there which was this green stuff. It was like poison ivy. There was a place where you slide into water. Mom and I were there. Then it was a spa and a pool. You could change it to different water. Isabel was there. Calvin was in the spa. He said ""someone actually likes Jared Leto"". He said he was going to call him Corbin. My leg kept going 'behind' me. There was a strange video of this fat girl's friend's mother."
"1573"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) I was watching a movie. This detective was asking Mary Warren (The Crucible, book) where someone was. Then it was me. She told him she didn't know. But then she said it was an accident. He was dead upstairs. We were in a barn and we went upstairs. He got up and it was Steven Weber and he was naked. She asked if he was gay and he said no and she said ""yes you are"" and he said ok, whatever (he was actually bisexual). She asked me if I thought that was hot and I said yes."
"1574"	"(2007-09-26 (16)) I was watching a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. Someone was saying that Heath Ledger's character in Brokeback Mountain loved hearing Jack Twist. There was a video of how he liked hearing his name and what he was doing, not just him talking. I was like 'I really want to read that book!'."
"1575"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was at school doing some work and Kirsten had to use some of mine."
"1576"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was at home with some friend. The pool was ok to swim in, but was green. I went in but my friend was hesitant. The sun came out and then the pool was clear. Ezra was in the spa. This dog was barking at me and someone suggested it was because I took its favourite song from the shed."
"1577"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) Mom picked up a friend and drove around this place to drop him off. Somehow we ended up walking and I went with the guy. Mom found me and complained. She had a police badge for me."
"1578"	"(2007-09-27 (16)) I was watching a show where this guy found his boyfriend cheating on him with a girl. At the end they were all standing together. The guys went off and had sex in an alley. I then felt like watching Brokeback Mountain."
"1579"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) Someone called me and at first it sounded like a robot, then like a transvestite and then like Autumn. It was Autumn, but I couldn't hear her properly. The next day she came up to me and she was having a party and she wanted me to come. Later, some girls asked me to be part of a robbery. At some point, Eugene and I were making out. Later, I was waiting to get picked up. I was standing with Darius and Eugene. Eugene and I were messing around, then Mom came. Roland and Clayton were in the back and Roland was in my seat. Ezra was in the front. Roland moved. I looked out the back window. Eugene looked at me and I waved and he waved back. Mom thought that I was acting weird."
"1580"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I went home and Mom and Ezra were with me. Mom had cleaned my room and I was angry about it. The vacuum had picked up chicken? I locked up to leave and Mom was saying that I should leave it unlocked because Dad was inside. I went back in and he had cheese and crackers. He said he had to explain about them at something he was going to."
"1581"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I was in my room and I had a photo of Eugene, on the bus, on my wall. Ezra came in and he was asking who it was and being annoying."
"1582"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I had a dream with Michael Cera, but I don't remember it now."
"1583"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) Samantha, Calvin, Evelyn and I were trying to get a photo for Attack of the Clouds. We were told to look worried. There was a picnic blanket and Fang was there, standing to the side. Evelyn said ""Ewan"", but she meant Obi Wan. These guys were teasing her. Melodie was there. There was a game with these houses and you had to get a fishing rod off some dude to pull the curtain up. There were other people you had to meet. Spaceman was around hanging with me. Mom was there too. Samantha went to a shop. There was a diary and Melodie and someone were crying because they thought that Samantha had done something. Samantha was setting up stuff for filming of Arrested Development. Some guy was upset."
"1584"	"(2007-09-28 (16)) I was looking up stuff about Michael Cera. There were photos of him playing tennis and he had rings on his second finger and pinky. I grimaced and was like 'Damn it! The worst fingers!'. I was annoyed because he was choosing to wear it, not because he had to for a role or something."
"1585"	"(2007-09-29 (16)) I was at a beach. The waves were really big and the water was coming close. We were walking back to the car."
"1586"	"(2007-09-29 (16)) I was at a shop. Ezra got some Monopoly game. He wanted this other game originally, but he couldn't find it. I went to the games section and they had Super Mario. I then went to the chocolate section. I was on a high chair which you used to get to unreachable chocolates. I was lying in the clothes section watching a lady going through the clothes."
"1587"	"(2007-09-30 (16)) Ezra and a friend went to Dad's old work (except he still worked there) to try out some hacking skills. I wandered off and then someone caught them and we all left. Later, Dad was asking us what was going on. I said I didn't know what they were doing and Ezra came and said that I wasn't a part of it."
"1588"	"(2007-09-30 (16)) I was at some house. The lady made pumpkin soup. Gob (Arrested Development) was there and we were friends. He had said that no-one would say no him and also that no dogs (or females, I kept forgetting during the dream) would follow him or something. Later, a dog started following me. I went into this bedroom and closed the door, then closed this other door. Then later, Gob and I were in this bathroom. It was huge and basically the whole room was a shower. Some girl was going to have a bath or a shower. We were running the water and I lay down to make sure she wasn't going to drown and she came in and told us off. After getting in the water, she said she liked the bath. Later, Gob and I were having sex in someone's bedroom, and it was my first time. Then it was a guy and a girl and she screamed and the house shook. He had to jump out the window so he didn't get caught. Gob and Buster (Arrested Development) were outside. I was thinking 'magician'. I was pregnant and was thinking that Eugene was the father."
"1589"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) I took some drugs as an experiment. Everything went colourful and weird, which reminded me of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (even though I haven't read it or seen it). I had some weird dreams, but they were cool. I think the drug was 'Teamocil'."
"1590"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) Some kid ran off. He was wanted by people. They mixed him up with an African. Mom was there looking for him."
"1591"	"(2007-10-01 (16)) I created this hybrid person which went evil. Calvin and I were hiding in this weird mushroom-like house. The hybrid was at the door and some curtain was open, but if he went to close it, it would see us through the door. Its eyes were blind looking."
"1592"	"(2007-10-02 (16)) I was at school and I was on the oval playing golf. Some Asian kid gave me a snake. I had decided to be a magician. I was talking to Mom, saying how a character in Arrested Development was a magician, and was thinking about Gob with the pennies. She was on a computer. I was watching something and The Final Countdown started playing and I said that it plays when Gob does a trick."
"1593"	"(2007-10-02 (16)) I was making that Nesquik cereal. It was ready but the milk was out of date. I was asking Mom to check if they were ok and was calling out the dates. Ezra was there too."
"1594"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) George-Michael and Maeby (both Arrested Development) were flirting. George-Michael was playing a weird game and was up to the boss at the end. This guy was chained up with him and his head was 'inverted'. Someone called up some movie guy and invited him to a party. Earlier, someone had died. They were a dog, but not. Lucille (Arrested Development)/my Mom cried. I saw Eugene's head (like in the Year 8 photo) rolling and birds were eating it. Mom was in a kitchen? Lindsay (Arrested Development)/Samantha hid behind something. There were two Maeby's. Ms Solomon was somewhere. Ezra was eating the shirt he was wearing."
"1595"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) Dad and Ezra were going to watch Arrested Development. I was saying ""Michael"" in Gob's voice and when I walked off I was saying ""Come on!""."
"1596"	"(2007-10-03 (16)) I was with Dad, Ezra and Will Arnett. We were lost near a forest somewhere and we were walking. I think it was Will's fault we were there. My legs were really hairy and I said ""I look like a bear!"". We hadn't had a shower for a week or something. We finally found civilization. We went into this shop. Will went off to find us somewhere to stay. This person asked me to design a website for them and they had a cool look already. Then we were somewhere else near a toilet. I went to the toilet and there was a head on the door and I was thinking of High Tension. Will was back and I sat next to him. We were eating cereal. Then he was across from me. There was a skull symbol on the cereal box. I was humming The Final Countdown. Then Jason Bateman was there too. I was reading the cereal box and it had killed a bunch of babies."
"1597"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was watching Room 401. This guy was at a castle and something was coming out of the TV and he was touching it."
"1598"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was watching Queer as Folk US. It wasn't a real episode, but I had seen it before in the dream. I was watching it again and I said the ""one with the painter"". I remember seeing Scott Lowell and Hal Sparks. Scott Lowell and I were going to get married."
"1599"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) Venus was supposedly going to die tonight at about 9 or 10pm and fall into Earth. Dad and Ezra went to the movies. There were these fairy things underground and they had something to do with it. Two years earlier, I managed to save them all, last year I saved some of them. This year, I didn't bother doing anything. I was hiding underneath something in the games room. Dad and Ezra were hiding under a table in the family room. People came in and found and shot Dad and Ezra, then they found me and shot me and we all died. Somehow, I remembered this and so was locking the doors and windows and turned off the lights. I checked on the fairies but they wouldn't answer. I went out the front and Ezra and Dad were coming back. These two old dudes were with them. They were like ""What's it supposed to be?"". Dad said a meteorite and he figured that nothing was going to happen, saying something about how you tell people about meteorites and they freak out. Then I saw it racing across the sky and it sounded like something was burning. Someone asked what it was and then ""Oh, it's the planet"". Then it came towards us and it was getting bigger. I was thinking of Eugene and that I should have told Calvin that I liked Eugene. An image of Eugene, which was orange, was 'etched' as I died (and I also woke up)."
"1600"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I 'fell' into my dream and I did a reality check which worked. I got excited and did it again. The room came into view and I wished for Eugene. He appeared and I was like 'What do I do now?' and then I grabbed him and we started making out."
"1601"	"(2007-10-04 (16)) I was at Midvale High School, which was completely different. Tiana was there and I started walking home and I thought I would call Mom to get me instead, but I didn't. I realized that I forgot my bag. Liza Minnelli was there and she went and got it for me. My bag looked a chicken. I was talking to her and she lived in my country. She was friends with Nana. I asked why she was working at Midvale. She had this teacher form and we had to pick what we thought the teacher was like. 'Giddy' was there and I said ""Well, I'll tick that since I was watching Arrested Development yesterday""."
"1602"	"(2007-10-05 (16)) I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. I was about to tell Dad a story about Gob (Arrested Development), when Will Arnett and Amy Poehler walked past. I was like 'what the hell?'. I had a newspaper and it had an Arrested Development crossword. I told Dad about Will and how I wanted to get a photo taken with him and he told me to ask him, but I couldn't. Then Jason Bateman walked past. Dad and Ezra went somewhere. I went into a little shop. Michael Cera came in and he said hello to me. He kept looking at me and talking to me and was acting nervous. I was trying not to walk off so I could talk to him. We ended up following each other. We were then sitting on lounges. Jason Bateman came past with some others and joked to each other that I was his girlfriend. His parents came and they were black and were also very strict. We were sitting on separate lounges, but his mother thought we were too close. Portia de Rossi came past and asked Michael something and left. Jason came past again and Michael said to ask (for a photo or whatever) and I said I can't. Then he got up and told David Cross that I wanted to get a photo, but his parents called him back. David was really funny and let me take a photo and stuff. I text Dad to ask if we could stay but I realized I had no credit and a low battery. Mom picked me up and Michael wanted to go with me, but she had the pickup."
"1603"	"(2007-10-05 (16)) I was at a house. The whole Arrested Development family was there. Gob was upset because he found out that he had a daughter. Someone had twin boys. There was a boat in a pool. I wanted to hang with George-Michael, so I went into the lounge (where he and Maeby were) and said that I couldn't sleep. It was only 6pm. The TV said it was midnight. My Name is Earl was on and Jason Lee was doing something. Maeby asked about some guitar show."
"1604"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) I was at a shop at a photo place near a pool table with the songs I'd done in 2003. These black guys were joking around and asked if I was one of ""those people who play Mp3's nearby people to look cool?"". There was a photo of our family at the photo place and I was in nappies, but Ezra wasn't. Later, Weird Al Yankovic and I were talking. David Cross was there and he lifted up his shirt. Weird Al asked if we liked 'green'. I wanted to change my background on the computer back to Arrested Development. There was a sleep lab and I told Mom I wanted to work with one. Samantha and Payton were in there. Later, she and Seamus were in the boot of a car having sex. Samantha became interested in Dad. I was at home and there was some chicken there and no-one had told me that food was ready."
"1605"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) Some lady gave Dad $40k to download Heroes and the rest of the shows we watch. When I came out I was annoyed at this. I had to crawl under these things in a garage that Poppa was in and I kept getting stuck. Fido was there."
"1606"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) I was watching Arrested Development, except it was set at home. Oscar Bluth, except he was called something else, came over. I couldn't remember which one was the 'real' one. He wanted to play some game on the computer. I then remembered George Bluth was the proper one and I said no. Then I was Lucille. George Bluth came back and saw that Lucille and Oscar Bluth had had sex and Lucille was saying to someone that Oscar Bluth was much nicer."
"1607"	"(2007-10-06 (16)) We had some map which detailed the path that the Easter was going to take. Jason Bateman jumped into this pool. Tony Hale was on some toy in the pool and Jason wanted to go on it. The guy 'playing' the Easter looked like Ben Whishaw."
"1608"	"(2007-10-07 (16)) Calvin and I went to some movie awards thing. First it was Dad and I, then Calvin, then a time traveling guy. He 'time traveled' with his clothes but couldn't bring anything else. When I first met him I wondered why he had no luggage. There was a guy and a girl behind the counter at the movie place and they were mean. They gave me a sheet to fill out stuff about the movies. Some teacher lady gave Samantha a tablet, so I asked for one."
"1609"	"(2007-10-07 (16)) Samantha had a balloon as did all these other people. I was trying to get one with a string (some had strings, others didn't) but other people got them all. I managed to get a blue one. Samantha kept trying to pop it. Later, she was asking herself when she had art and I said that she had it next. I was then on this oval place and Mr Reilly was there. There was a little electric fence and I walked over it. I went to class and Amazing started playing and I realized it was coming from my iPod. Someone said ""Who was that?"" and I said ""Oh it was my iPod"". Eugene was in the class."
"1610"	"(2007-10-07 (16)) I was rebuilding a set with Henry (The Time Traveler's Wife -- book). We were going out. We were doing something with this ledge that was falling apart. We had to reach into this water to get the parts. Henry died and I was upset. He had been my first kiss, and I was thinking of when we had been together."
"1611"	"(2007-10-08 (16)) We were at a shop. I got a little Twix and had ""thirteen bites, two to go"", when Ezra took it. They had some mix bag and there was a Yowie in there and a tube, which looked like toothpaste but it said it was Panadol and was empty (it was curled up). I was then at home watching TV. I went to AirActive, but it looked different. I was watching some movie thing. There were four black guys and they all had short hair. One was called Shorty and was Marlon Wayans. Shawn Wayans was there too. I said ""just call them all Shorty!"". There was a house on a raft-like thing and the people on that fell off the house and died. The others were hanging off."
"1612"	"(2007-10-08 (16)) I was at shop with Mom. It kept changing. I was looking for The Time Traveler's Wife by 'Bluth'. There was a spa/sauna place and there were books in there. In The Time Traveler's Wife, Clare had seven kids."
"1613"	"(2007-10-09 (16)) Calvin and I went to this lecture place. We had gone there the day before. We had the sheets so we were getting them out. The lady asked a question and I wasn't listening because I was getting the sheets so she told me to move away from Calvin. Today's task was the same as yesterday. The guy next to me was annoying me and he found out that I didn't like being a girl so continued to annoy me. Calvin started singing a song and I was laughing and everyone was looking at him. When the class finished Calvin hung around for a while. Somehow me and the annoying guy ended up at a motel and had sex. When we first arrived there, I was thinking that I'd lost my virginity already to Michael Cera. The next day, we were there again. Calvin was closing these blinds and some girls were complaining. The annoying guy was making out with some girl."
"1614"	"(2007-10-09 (16)) I was at Nana's. Someone had a baby. I went to bed. Ezra was in my bed there and I didn't remember him coming up. The beds were different. He woke up and said that Mom had dropped him off. The next morning we were packing our stuff away (we had a lot) and the bag was heavy. Ezra had a made-up friend called Brendan and he was dropped off to stay, but he was three years younger than he was last time we saw him. Dad was annoyed. There was this house which was on a car or something; it moved around."
"1615"	"(2007-10-09 (16)) For some reason I had to change my appearance. I had a short red wig (which reminded me of Lana in China (Smallville). I had black eyebrows too. There was this old lady at this shop. She was trying to give me a calendar. Something happened and this evil devil thing took over the shop. All the shop went blue and the devil thing had a gigantic tongue."
"1616"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) Ezra and I were on Runescape and we were teleporting. Everywhere looked different. It was all red and lava-ish."
"1617"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) I was at this pool place with the school. Calvin and I went to a place under this bridge and it was small and full of bugs. There was a time for the pool. Sometimes it was water, sometimes lava, sometimes there was nothing there. The lava was actually milk with some food on top. Earlier there had been a train ride and it would go over the walls and all. It was pretty scary. Mom went on too. I saw a poster for The Kingdom and it had Jason Bateman on it."
"1618"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) I was watching a movie with Jason Bateman. Michael Cera was his son. There was a flashback and Michael Cera's character was being played by a fat kid using a phone at this building. Then these people, on woman and the rest men, shot a lady in the face, killed some cops etc. They went to this cop place and there was a lady in there and cops in a car outside. The cops outside managed to survive and tried to tell the lady inside to get out. The people came into her room and she jumped out the window. They killed her. Buster (Arrested Development) came in with stuff for his mother (the woman they just killed). He didn't notice anything wrong, which they noticed. For some reason, they gave him a bag of this brown stuff which was actually cocaine. Then it was real life and I had the cocaine. I tasted it and my tongue felt funny. My heart started beating faster and I felt funny. Later, Ezra woke me up to ask something about my web site. Dad asked me ""Have you tried the brown stuff?"" and I said no."
"1619"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) I was watching some Arrested Development thing and Lucille had married into the family and she wasn't their real mother. George-Michael had a girlfriend and Lucille didn't want her in the family and he had to marry someone else."
"1620"	"(2007-10-10 (16)) I was at this place full of seats and people. Will Arnett was behind me playing with his son. They were talking about sandwiches."
"1621"	"(2007-10-11 (16)) I went to Santiago's with Mom. He had a Segway and I was like ""OMG!"". He let me try it and I was pretty good with it and I was talking about Gob (Arrested Development)."
"1622"	"(2007-10-11 (16)) I went to a camp. We got sorted into two groups of five; two of the groups were nerds and weirdoes. I got put into a group of ""weird people with nothing to do"". Jason Lee was put in there too and he was really quiet. Some ten year old girl, who was the daughter of the camp runner, was put next to Alan Rickman, who was actually Josh Duhamel. He had to give her a kiss and said something about himself that was like ""Godfather or secretary"". There were cabins. Will Arnett was in one. In the one I was in, Farrah, Jamison and Ariana were in bunk beds. I was locking it up. Will got shot and I was talking to Ezra on MSN. The font kept going stretchy and unreadable."
"1623"	"(2007-10-11 (16)) I was at fancy house. I went to the main bedroom and Tim Curry as Frankenfurter was on the bed and also on the chair. When I saw him on the bed I was surprised and cried out ""Yahoo!"". He opened his mouth as to say 'oh'. He looked really creepy, so I left."
"1624"	"(2007-10-12 (16)) It was the first day of school and I had made myself breakfast and had made Ezra toast. Tigger had lost her sense of taste. I ended up with cat fur in my mouth and I lost my sense of taste. Ezra told Dad and I got the day off. There were no water bottles in the fridge."
"1625"	"(2007-10-12 (16)) George Michael (the singer) was in a spa with girls. Two girls had had sex with him. It was being reenacted."

"1627"	"(2007-10-12 (16)) I was watching Sliders. It started with the end of the last episode I watched with the wave coming towards them. Jason Bateman was in it and he came through the portal and a water tornado came and took him back, but he came through and the portal said something like he hadn't been completely through it yet and so was allowed to go through it again."
"1628"	"(2007-10-13 (16)) Mom, Granma and I were staying at a motel. Mom said we got room number 217 and I said ""something bad is going to happen"". I was thinking either a fire or a burglar. Then the owner ran out screaming ""Fire!"". We grabbed our stuff and jumped into the car. We had two animals -- a pig and something else. Mom went back to get them. The pig wasn't breathing and Mom gave it CPR."
"1629"	"(2007-10-13 (16)) Dad, Ezra, Payton and I went to this restaurant/stripper place. It was full of half-naked guys and I was like 'ew'. I was thinking that since Payton was gay he would be happy here. There were two mystery meals so we got them. Mine had garlic prawns which were yuck, and Payton got this nice chicken thing."
"1630"	"(2007-10-13 (16)) I was watching this awards show and Michael Cera was on it. He was older and looked wog-like. He didn't speak very good English. He had rings on and I was like 'ew'. Alia Shawkat was angry at him. I looked my name up on the internet and something came up about Michael Cera having a crush on me and that we were having a baby and I was like ""What the hell?!""."
"1631"	"(2007-10-14 (16)) Mom had a new house. My room had no walls; they were all mesh-y. My website was different and private. It was actually my room. I decided to wear twenty different pieces of clothing. I had a glove thing on, undies, board shorts, a sock and a bra and was about to put a shirt on when Will Arnett looked in and I shooed him out. Then Mom came in and wouldn't let me close the door. She put a baby in and then I was going to kill it. I punched some kid after he punched me. Later, people were climbing up the walls to get into my room. I was pulling them down. There were lots and I grabbed a girl and she fell and hit her head so I did that to the others. Then I gave up. Later I was at some school thing. Ramona gave me a card we needed. People had sheets that they'd printed from my site. Mathias was there and he had a picture and a cartoon. There was something about Gavin. Ramona had a dream that I'd had about Eugene. I was trying to find him. I was thinking that Ramona was like Calvin and Tiana was like Evelyn."
"1632"	"(2007-10-14 (16)) Dad, who was sometimes Jason Bateman, Ezra and I were in a car. Dad had a wife and she was coming over. This van next to us took a dead body out and it was her. Dad stopped the car and was upset. I was at a shop later and this guy had a Segway."
"1633"	"(2007-10-14 (16)) Arrested Development was on the TV. It was a scene with George-Michael and Maeby. Gob came on too. Then it was something else and it showed a street, then a house. These zombies were coming and they didn't like lights."
"1634"	"(2007-10-15 (16)) I was at a meeting and I said that I had faked some girl's death (the girl looked like Portia de Rossi). I was in my room and I thought I heard someone so I closed the door. These people tried to get in and I was sitting with my back against the door with my feet pressing against the bedside table. I text Mom to come over and help. Eventually I yelled at the people and told them to leave me alone and come back another day. They went. Then my room was a motel room. I looked outside and saw that the people had been cops. Someone else then tried to get in and they were bad guys. I screamed and tried to get the cops attention. I managed to open the door and ran past this little white guy (the rest were black). They started coming after me and I was jumping down these stairs. I met with this girl who I followed into her motel room. It was discovered that I could change other people's appearance. There was a cat outside and it hissed so we decided to run, but the people came. It was just a friend of hers, but it was actually a bad guy who had disguised herself. I was changing people. One girl ended up pink and slimy. I accidentally changed this guy to a big, muscly guy and then I changed him into a hunchback, which was permanent. The girl (who was called Renee) said that Ezra, Dad and I needed to leave because they would come. I was telling Mom. This guy was disguised as Ezra's friend. We poked him in the gut? Before we left Ezra and I were playing Pokemon."
"1635"	"(2007-10-17 (16)) I was in an alternate world. The alternate me was in Arrested Development. It kept changing to real life. I was in a kitchen with Jason Bateman and he said something and then Will Arnett came in and replied to Jason and what he said 'confirmed' that we had had sex, which he had. I was playing with Simba later. I called him Tigger and then said ""No, you're Simba"". Claire (Heroes) wasn't healing and was dying. She left. Ezra and I were on the side of the road and we went to find her. It was night time. She was leaning against a log thing on the side of the road. We went to her and she healed. Then all these people with cameras came. She was wearing boots and they were muddy. She said ""why waste $2000 [on other shoes] "". I went to this room and I looked for the number 217. I had to find a piece of paper. Snoopy was in there. The outside of the room was glass and had this thing you could lift and go in. Later a cat was sticking its head out. Mom and Ezra distracted Snoopy and I let the dogs and cats out of the room. The room was messy and my pen broke and I so did my torch. I fixed them. Mom and a friend were at a table later. Someone was making some bread things. Will Arnett was crying."

I was at a park and the school was there. This guy said ""hey Izzy"" and he said he was from my class in Year 1 and was called Archie. I had no idea who he was. I was playing on the playground. Someone said something which meant that we had to pay to use the park. The slide had a cigarette on it. This guy took it off and put it in his mouth to put it out."

We realized we had no water, so I sent Mom to go get some. Someone sat in her spot so I got up and found more. I was next to a little girl who was waiting for her mother. Her mother came and we moved again. Something happened to the movie and it skipped to the end. People in astronaut like suits came in and they shut the doors. We thought that they were going to gas us. They had to give us something so we could breathe. Then we had to line up in order of last name. Mariana was there. I saw Eugene.

The people inside wanted to kill them and one of the 'leaders' said to hide behind this thing. Some thought the people would help them and stayed in their seats.

I moved to the back of the class. Darius and the others followed me. Eugene came and he was near me and was trying to look at my book. Darius picked up this jacket and threw it on my head and it fell to the floor. Mom had found some water pattern. We were at McDonald's. There were two kids (a girl and a boy) and they were my kids.

I saw Alejandro. There were gates everywhere. Then it was a game. The windows were up and the doors were locked in the car. We drove and hit this lady. People were chasing us and I kept driving. Then I fell off this cliff thing and slid down into these trees. Then it would reset and I kept dying."
"1653"	"(2007-10-27 (16)) I was watching Sliders. They were in this peaceful, pretty world. Then we were on this beach and there was a building which had been the only sign of humans so far.

One guy didn't have one on. Calvin and I were playing this game which matched you up with a person of your preferred sex. Calvin's 'choices' were Madelyn or Liesl.

There were shelves and they made a story play out and they moved stuff around without moving. I told someone that it was cool but I wasn't going to give them any money. The girl got angry. She went invisible and attacked me. At one point she broke her neck over the thing they put the ice-creams in. She was still ok and I finally escaped from the shop. It was dark outside. I called Mom but I had no signal. I tried to call Dad but it didn't work. I found some police and they said to follow them, then tried to lead me to this shifty place so I ran off. I tried calling the police and there was still nothing. I was really scared and upset and I did a reality check and realized I was dreaming. I started shouting ""Wake up!"". I was then in bed and I was at Mom's house, but it was different. Darren was up and Smudgy was there. Darren brought him to me and I was thinking that I haven't seen him in a long time. I heard a guy's voice out the back. He was throwing stuff into a pool. The house was two storeys. He walked up these stairs and I recognized from a dream I'd had. He threw something and it landed above a person in a photo. I said that happened before and he remembered too. The photo was of a wedding and I asked ""Who's Jenna McCarthy?"".

We went into a backyard, which was paddock like. Will told me that the first time we met he'd actually bashed this guy beyond necessary. I knew about the guy already as Will had stolen something from him. This guy came and told Will that there was a job for him. He'd get $900 and $600 for something, in August (which was next month). We left. We met with Mom, Clayton, Dad and others. Someone asked Will when it happened and he asked what. They said ""got hitched"" and he said ""I'm never getting hitched"". The person said ""Oh, you're girl-kept"". We were at this place and there were heaps of movies. I saw Battle Royale there and there were two different covers. One had all the people on the front and I looked for Shuya and Noriko, who I found. The other was random and had a female cop on it. I chose the 'proper' one and Mom was going to buy it. These people were in Paris. There was a gigantic bad guy who was throwing cars and stuff at us. My tooth was hurting."

I tried to read a magnet on the fridge, which had different ones to call, but I could read it. It was suddenly black outside. The kitchen light wouldn't turn on. I did a reality check and 'woke up' but then went back to the dream. The cops came and then left. These girls came in to party and I made them get out. They tried to steal some sauces. The window started breaking and I had to keep checking the doors were locked. Mom 'stole' these cars, which were long oil-ish trucks. She went to a food shop. This lady came and she was a bad guy. She could see the future in one of her eyes. Someone threw little rocks at Ezra. One hit the window but it didn't break. We stole a truck and I moved the second one and parked it well.

Then this old lady came and walked fast and the lady said that the guy was first and she said ""you didn't say till when"". She let the old guy in and then he died. I don't remember what happened in the other book. Then I was in some class. Dmitri and others were reading comic books. I was doing something with batteries and magnets. Mr Stevenson dropped some Yu-Gi-Oh! comics on my desk and told me to read them."

I got up and when I went back to my seat, Classmate-F-21 was there and I said ""that's my seat"" and she didn't want to move. I yelled at her so she got up. I sat down and was trying not to laugh."
"1693"	"(2007-11-10 (16)) I had gotten this dog and it was at Nana's. I went up there one day and Austin, Uncle Wilbur, some lady and Poppa were there. Mom got me a bed and Poppa was checking it. Ezra was there too. The top of the cubby house had been taken off. Nana said the dog was missing. They had little fenced off section with kittens. I picked up an orange and white one. Ezra picked up a black one. Nana and I went to this garage looking shop to look for the dog. We had to be quiet, but the guy saw us. Nana quickly said ""pound of eyes please"". He thought I was acting weird. He farted and walked out. Then he came and he was holding a pig (which was my 'dog') and he was going to kill it and I screamed ""No!"" and went after him, crying. Then it was somewhere in England. It was showing the Thames, except it was called 'Ems'. Granma was telling me how to pronounce it. This guy was driving next to it and the road was slippery and he fell into the water. There were shoes in the river and people were calling them out. This Scottish guy was hanging over a cliff and this cop let him fall and he cried out ""You ooter bastard!""."

"1697"	"(2007-11-11 (16)) I was at a place that looked like school. We were at the front of the school next to the carpark. I was being held captive along with a bunch of guys. One was really hot, but he got killed escaping. We were given dinner on this long table and there was lots of food. There was a skinny Asian and a skinny guy there. I suggested that they [our captives] were going to eat us because the rest of us were 'chunky'. The people holding us were actually aliens (they looked like a slimy version of the rhino in season three, episode one of Doctor Who). I said if the skinny one was called out, then they were eating us. They got called. One of the skinny ones escaped and was on a train, but the aliens came. Then it was a game and this guy was running along the side of the train and he had to jump on this ledge and get on the train. Mittens was somewhere and I said ""How am I going to eat you?"". I was in this room and they turned off the electricity and my fan."

There was a flashback in the movie where this kid was playing with Fantastic Four toys. He had one that looked like Ioan Gruffudd. He grew up to be this Earth protector guy. These robot things which held up the Earth had gotten angry and were messing things up. Michael Cera was in this shop. This girl went out with this guy and she took photos of all these people and put them in this book. A rocket was leaving Earth's atmosphere. I left my room and went to Dad's room. Ezra was there.

"1702"	"(2007-11-14 (16)) This person was doing an experiment in this building which was a school, I think. I can't remember what they wanted to do, but they accidentally used a student rather than a random. The room he was in had a one-way mirror, but it was a blackboard and the guy covered it with chalk so no-one could see what he was doing."
"1703"	"(2007-11-14 (16)) I found this awesome kitten. It was very smart and cute. We had some big adventure with it and then it wanted to stay at this nearly empty house but I was like ""Nah, come stay with us""."

I tried to say that I was here. Mr Reilly was away because he was sick. I sat at the back. The door was at the back left and there were three rows of tables going back from the front (two lots). I sat at the back right table."

Dad said that ""one wants to have sex with you"" and I was like ""What the hell? Ew!"". The photos didn't show anything except ""two and a half"" showed my bum. In the morning I told Mom in the car on the way on to school. I was crying and I said they should have more respect. Mom was like ""Oh, now you're crying"" and stuck up for them. I said ""It's the worst thing they could do to me""."

They were Return of the Living Dead zombies and I was hiding out in the science room, which was different, with Evelyn and Calvin. We got attacked a few times and killed the zombies. I went out to find weapons and I found pipes in some mud. I found Eugene and Darius and others and told them to go to the science room.

Later, the photo was in the paper and on the news. Eugene, Bradley and someone had been the only people in the world to get 31% on a SIDE test when they were 3 years old. I was feeling proud of Eugene. I was near Ms Pascal's office and looking at the board, which had a bunch of photos on it. They had Eugene and I wanted them. I was in two of the photos, but one of them had a hole where my face would be and the other had a pin in it. I was about to take them when I saw Ms Pascal staring at me from the top of the stairs with a weird look on her face. She came down and I said that I love photos. She said ""obviously you like someone in them"". There was a picture of the country with black kids there too."

There was a cute thing in this tree. I tried to take a photo of it. I text Mom to ask what time the exam was. Ms Pascal saw me and I told her I was just finding out when the exam was. Calvin had tried to get a photo of the cute thing. There was an echidna on the grass. This crow was being scary."
"1714"	"(2007-11-18 (16)) I got out of the car. Mom and Ezra were there. Mom was talking weird. I had my period and I mouthed 'period' to let her know, but so Ezra didn't hear but then she said it out loud."

He was wearing sandals and I was checking the Morton's toe thing. He had normal feet and I was thinking 'Yay, Eugene's probably got normal feet'. Another day, his mother was teaching except her name was Ms Carniapolous or something. She was fat and mean. Mom was there and she didn't like her either. She also had normal feet."
"1720"	"(2007-11-22 (16)) Some girl's uncle was Victor Pascow (Pet Sematary). He still looked young. Then he was this ""Asian"" creature who could turn invisible. She went to him to hide.

He walked away from us and when I got spare time I joined him and said ""What's up Jimmy?"". He said that it was birthday and I said ""Oh, June 23rd"". I was thinking the date was the 24th. I was like ""I can't believe I forgot your birthday, I'm not as good at remembering birthdays now"". I was thinking of Michael Palin, and that I'll always remember his birthday."

Eric Idle walked past and said hello to Samantha and the others and then shouted out ""See you Izzy"" and I was like ""Oh my God!"". I had a hat on and I put it over my face and giggled.

Then she said ""I bet people have been looking at you. Maybe the legs... the slimy fat, no!"". I told Calvin to go. The manager came. I went to the toilet and I flushed and it flooded the place.

Wear the shirt with green sleeves"". The clock read 12:10, and the exam started at 12 (reading time was at 11.50). I got my shoes and left. Jeremiah was just coming.

Later, I realized that Calvin was in Eugene's group, all members of which were males. There was some dating/matching up thing and I didn't want anyone to get Eugene.

Elijah and his friends were on this bus and he had chocolate."

Michael Cera and I planned to do a fake robbery and then run off. We both smoked and we had to separate, so I took some of his smokes. Then I was at Nana's and it was no longer olden days. Michael was supposed to have made it back before me. I went inside and Ezra was on the lounge. I asked if Dad or Michael had explained why we had stolen the stuff.

Later I was at home out the back. Eugene had adopted this kitten and called it Clifford. Sometimes Eugene was Hal Sparks. I said ""Clifford? Like that big red thing?"" and then said it was a stupid name. I was looking at some papers from years ago. I found one that said I was going to adopt this girl called Cleffa as a school project thing. The back door was twisted later and I got Dad to fix it."

Scott didn't know though. Ezra asked the person he was with, who was an African guy, for some rings. I didn't want him getting Scott to put them on because they are gross."

They were saying the names of songs, including Counting the Beat and Starting Over. I went to the checkout and the lady put some paper in the bag and I said it was my dream. She looked at me weird. We had a movie ticket to see A Good Heart, which was a movie, but the song was playing too. When I left, the lady was on the phone and I expected it was with the police, because she thought I was shifty. I went to this other shop. I had salty fingers and I wheeled Poppers in.

The teacher came and I got up to get a pen out of my bag and she wouldn't let me. We had to press down on the paper with these coloured textas which made rays.

Then Dad and Ezra were there and he said he'd go [wherever I was going] but then Mom said she will. So Dad left and then Mom took off the street and pulled into a house. I got into the Mighty and drove up there (I didn't know what I was doing though) and finally managed it. I knocked on the door and a lady answered. I went in and saw Mom sitting down. The house was really nice and had a neat, modern style but was mostly white. Then Calvin and I were in this queue to get some sort of animal. He was ahead of me in the line. Some guy had a toad. He was going through his order ""cranberry, apples, cinnamon, pecan, nut, date nut"" then I said ""lemon poppy seed muffin!"" and called Calvin. He came and saw.

Micah (Heroes) got it and was running. He was on the good side. I ran after him to make sure no-one got it. I saw Theodore standing around and I asked him if he was good or bad. Micah was really fast. Ali Larter was there too. Micah through the baby to the main good people and they put it in this barn. I was thinking it wasn't real.

I did and when it was on the fridge, some of its legs fell off and it shivered. I put it on the breakfast bar and then this orange ball of light appeared inside of it. Then this circular light (surrounding it, like a force field thing) came out of it. I dodged it and asked Dad what it was. He didn't know and told me not to touch it.

Later, we were hanging around. Mom left but Darren stayed. I went to get a cord out of the car."
"1777"	"(2007-12-10 (16)) Jillian and I were at 'school'. We had to go outside and throw water balloons at each other. There were also holes and they came out of them and we had to miss them. There were little and big water balloons but only the big ones counted. Seth Green came out and one point and I threw a water balloon at his foot. We went inside and she went to get our scores and I dried off in front of a fire. A teacher told me to apologize to Seth Green and I was wondering why. After we threw the last balloon (and I won) these two teachers thought we might have lied. I asked ""Aren't there cameras?"". There was a Runescape poster and Jillian said it sucks and I said it owns."
"1778"	"(2007-12-11 (16)) I looked out the games room window and saw Kiki with her kitten. She skulked away behind the shed, so I quickly went outside. The kitten was near the cage, which I'd left unlocked and two other kittens (including the black one) had gotten out. There was a hole in the cage and the kittens were climbing out. I put them all back. Mom came later and I took everything out of the cage and Mom put clean carpet in."
"1779"	"(2007-12-11 (16)) I was at a shop. People from school were standing in a circle throwing a ball. Calvin and Samantha were next to me and Chriss was next to Samantha. It got to a couple of us. Chriss had thrown a ball at me earlier and I caught it, but thought he was Eugene. Ezra and I were then playing a live Popomundo and we had to walk around and ""be the hits of 1973+"". Mom was getting us Baskins & Robbins and I got choc chip cookie dough."
"1780"	"(2007-12-11 (16)) I told Calvin that I was getting a new computer and asked for my Sims 2 games. He said I could come over and play Sims 2 with him and I was like ""no""."

"1782"	"(2007-12-12 (16)) Mom took me the shop and I was looking for this nice ice-cream. She was going to make butter chicken for dinner and I was complaining because I didn't really like it that much."
"1783"	"(2007-12-12 (16)) I went to 'school'. No-one I knew was there. This guy had a crane and was making this blow-up dude dance in a tree. This guy who looked like David Anders and this other guy had met earlier. The other guy was going out with this other guy but he was telling the David Anders look-alike that he was in love with him. They fought and David fell off the edge of this cliff type of thing and the guy grabbed him and there was a shiny thing on his back. He turned robot like and saved the guy (he was a robot). Dad was using the crane later. The Spice Girls were using the crane for a show. Baby Spice had pigtails and this girl commented on them."

"1786"	"(2007-12-13 (16)) I went to some place with Dad and I ordered chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate sauce (which meant chocolate ice-cream). When it was delivered it was a small piece of something and it had corn in it. I said I couldn't complain and Dad wouldn't complain for me. There was something to do with David Anders."
"1787"	"(2007-12-13 (16)) I was watching something with Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall. I don't remember anything but Adrian was laughing."
"1788"	"(2007-12-14 (16)) Ron Rifkin was talking to someone. This guy was talking to this girl. I don't remember what happened but Malcolm McDowell turned into the aforementioned guy. He was known for being good at something."
"1789"	"(2007-12-14 (16)) I was watching Gossip Girl for some reason. Blair was doing something and said her name was Leighton Meester. I told Ezra that was her real name. There were two guys and one was David Lee Smith and the other was made-up. I liked the made-up guy and he liked me. They made this funny face with their mouths open. I tried to take a photo but it took a while and they got bored and left. They were taking off their pants later to put a shirt on and were holding onto the rail of the stairs."
"1790"	"(2007-12-14 (16)) I was going down a path on a water balloon, which was three years old. Ezra, Dad and others came down on these big balls and I wanted that instead and my balloon rolled off and broke."

"1792"	"(2007-12-15 (16)) I was at this place outside and it was night. I had this job which Chuck (Gossip Girl) had gotten for me. We were at this gate which we had to guard and he gave me a beer. These guys came and they asked me if I wanted to be working here and I said not really. Chuck then was a Jason Bateman look-alike, but didn't really look like him and he said ""Why did I have to roll you!"", which I deciphered as he had to choose someone for something and had rolled a dice. I was arguing with him and we both stormed off together. We were then at this place with computers. He said something about us getting married and I said ""We don't have to get married"" (he figured because we were 'enemies' we would get together). I was trying to make a sandwich."
"1793"	"(2007-12-15 (16)) I was on my Myspace and I had photos of me as a baby. There was one of me when I was 'six'. Dad complained because I looked really fat."
"1794"	"(2007-12-15 (16)) I was playing some game that had Super Mario Galaxy like gravity. For the last bit I had to be really careful. I fell, and then it was real and I was leaving some place.

Later, we went around the side of the house and he and this female ant turned into people. They were making out in the wood shed. He was kind of ugly. He was also Scottish and came inside. He kept saying how big everything was. He ended up taking a bus somewhere and we had to find him. He went to this big sandy place. Then I think he was an ant again, sometimes. He kept getting under the sand and I was following the hills he made. He killed this guy in a pool and later he killed another guy. I found him and he was small again (but now he was sand). I wet him and he turned into this creature that was mud coloured but was like a see-through cushion. I wet him again and he went darker and went back to being sand. He went to these stars (like in Super Mario Galaxy) and he said it was a portal to a place with awesome technology and stuff. The people he killed came back to life."
"1799"	"(2007-12-18 (16)) There was this murderer bloke and we thought he was coming tonight. Ezra, someone and I shared a room. I slept under this desk so the bloke wouldn't find me. He came and killed the other two, but didn't find me."

I went in and found my ""dildo"" which was actually the remains of a dead relative/friend. Some lady had sex with it. I stayed with the people sometimes and I went back. I got sick of them and pretended to leave. Later I got my things. This older brother and I went out to see this dog. There were dogs in cages and one cage was open and there was a feral dog. It got out. There was this little shed place. I went to hide but the dog got in and took up all the space (it had like mesh on the outside). I managed to get out, but it kept following me. I managed to run to the road and it got hit by a car. Someone said something about my smell. Later, there was another one. It sniffed me. Then Valerie and Farrah were there and they had orange juice. One of them said ""Anyone want any orange juice?"" and I said ""Ew, it's orange"" and that I only drink water. Then I was in the games room and this dog jumped through the window. I quickly ran to my bedroom and shut the door. The lock wasn't working. I went to my laptop to find out how to get rid of a raged dog. There were two pages of information and something about Johnny Depp. Then I was in a desert. The kittens were revealed to be two Arabic men. They had a gun. We were in this 'pyramid' and we had to activate this thing but we had to be quick or we would get sucked under by this quicksand so I said that I wasn't going to do it."
"1802"	"(2007-12-19 (16)) John Lennon was alive and we were friends. Only a few people knew that he was alive. Someone got suspicious and we had to get this lady to say something to get rid of them. Someone said ""I thought you had a bee sting"" (the wrong answer would have revealed that John was alive) and she said ""Oh yeah, a bee stung me and I fell backwards into some honey"" and I said ""Oh yeah, that was funny"". There was this messy place that people were turning into a shop."

"1804"	"(2007-12-20 (16)) I was at this place which had all this stuff about dinosaurs. I was there without a ticket/pass. Ezra and Mom went out through the entrance which was being guarded. I realized that if you went out that way, there was a way to get back in. I went downstairs to this place with food. I got a roll with some money that Mom had given me. Ezra got this really nice choc mint ice-cream and I wanted it but didn't have enough money. If I didn't get the other half of the roll I could afford it. First, they were going to get me to help out by 'painting' eyes on a dinosaur figure. I noticed they were making my roll still and I said ""Why are you making me a roll when I asked for ice-cream?"". They then half made the ice-cream and then no-one wanted to finish it. I complained about it. I had supposedly been in an episode of Grey's Anatomy but I didn't remember. I went on IMDb and they had a photo of this girl who didn't look anything like me. Her birthday was January 25 1979. The people on the message boards thought that something was wrong. It was actually a guy."
"1805"	"(2007-12-20 (16)) I was playing some game (in 'real life') and I was standing on this platform with some other people. There was a monster and we had to shoot it.

"1806"	"(2007-12-20 (16)) Dad, Ezra and I were in the car. Dad dropped me off at school but I didn't get out of the car. He continued driving and he got to a set of traffic lights and I got out and began walking home."

Two girls and I were staying there. He was in a meeting with these guys and was yelling at them. Later this guy, who was George Harrison, raped one of the girls who looked like Julie Benz. The other girl and I were hiding in my room. I ran into David's bedroom and told him I saw that ""George Harrison was being gay"". He got up and yelled at him and got rid of him. Some time later, he said we had to decide our relationship with him. We were randomly given two choices and mine were marry or lover. I liked him and he confessed to liking me and said he would've given me those two choices even if I hadn't gotten them. I was out the back and there were all these boxes. He said not to open them, but I did anyway. There were body parts in them (chopped and wrapped like in Dexter). I didn't let the other girls see it. I went inside and he was like ""What are you going to choose now? You're not looking for a serial killer"" and I was thinking 'Yeah, but Ted Bundy's pretty hot'. One of the girls didn't want to go out with him. There was a cute chicken. Sometime before, this guy died on a street. An old Asian dude went into, and took over, his body."

In 'real life' Sydney was frozen in the ice."
"1811"	"(2007-12-22 (16)) My neck had been cut so I had to be careful not to open it up. I was then at a school and we had to wear dresses. I was going to say that I couldn't but a teacher said I didn't have to. Then I was in a gym and I was going to join in with sport but then remembered about my knee and got out (they were playing badminton and ping pong). I was in a class. Autumn was going to sit next to me, but moved over to the back. Later, I grabbed a newspaper to get a discount on a game. Dad was in the car. We picked up Ezra and Emery and they were in some play."
"1812"	"(2007-12-22 (16)) I was watching a movie and Stanley Kubrick was directing it. It was set out the back of Nana's. I was discussing the movie with Stanley Kubrick and he asked me how pretty I thought the main character, Joanne, was out of 10. I said a 3. I was then taking over as the main character and it was real. Her boyfriend (now mine and I didn't like him) took me and it was raining. The rain was dangerous so he took me to the granny flat which was made of metal. I slipped down the path. Poppa and others were in the garage. Simba and some other cats were in the room. I was telling Ezra about Duck Soup and how everything the main character says is funny."

He found out he was selling it and they were arguing. The guy's wife and kid overheard the conversation so he killed them, but the wife was ok so she was sent to some place where she had to dance. I was then there but I needed to pee so I went to the toilet and before I could get my pants down this tall guy came and I said ""I'm just going to the toilet, I didn't kill a thing"". He said ""Didn't kill a thing"" and then shot 'me'. Then I was somewhere and they sent us photos of them killing our pets. I only remember seeing Tinkerbell and Spaceman though. I was really upset. Mom, Ezra and I were staying at some place. People from House of 1000 Corpses lived next door. Otis was playing Scrabble. We were going to sleep."
"1815"	"(2007-12-23 (16)) I was out the front and I saw Jack Osbourne walking next door and I remembered that they lived next door to us. Later, Sharon came out and I said ""you don't come out much anymore, not that I'm ever outside"". She said something about Ozzy being away. Later, I was at school. Calvin was acting weird. We went to this place outside and Margarita came and wanted to talk to him. I was wondering why and was yelling at her because she was a stupid loser. She was like ""I'm not doing anything to you, you're a loser"" etc. I said stuff about what her and her friends said and did to me etc. Then she and Calvin began talking and he started crying and said it had been hard for him since he came out. I was thinking 'huh?'. She comforted him and I was wondering why he told everyone else but not me. Then I was thinking that I was right about just picking the loser females to like and was thinking of Sabrina and Mariah."
"1816"	"(2007-12-24 (16)) I was watching a talk show and the host was Joshua Jackson, who was very gay and looked like he did in Cruel Intentions. Scott Lowell was his guest. Joshua wasn't funny at all and the audience was silent. I was thinking 'how the hell is this on?'. He said something about ""Jimmy Jackson"" and reached over to Scott and said ""Ooh! I said his name!"" and giggled. Then he said something about his wife and sobbed. I was reading a review and Scott comforted him and they were saying stuff about life and the director knew what they were doing and everyone seemed sad. I thought they were going to say that Scott had tried to kill himself."
"1817"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) There were zombies. I went into this deli thing with a bunch of people. I went to tell the manager that we should close the door. The manager was Samuel L. Jackson. He didn't want to close the door, but did anyway."
"1818"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) I was driving with a guy and a girl. I liked the guy. There were zombies, and he had picked up supplies from a shop earlier. We found this other town and there weren't any zombies around. We went into a shop and there were people inside. I asked if there were any zombies around. They said that there were a few. We got a trolley and got heaps of water. The girl stayed with the trolley. I looked for an esky to keep the water in. I told someone to get something 'fun'. I got rollerblades, notebooks, pens and the last issue of That's Life. Then Mom was there and she said she was buying pencils. There was a crash and I went to the trolley. It had been trapped in a little room with the girl on the other side. I was trying to ask what happened and then the zombies got her. I told people to shoot the zombies when they came through. I found the guy we were with and we ran."
"1819"	"(2007-12-27 (16)) Calvin, Mariah, Genevieve and others were doing a project for media. They had fully done up this place to be the setting.

We went out the back and I was talking to her. Dad was there."
"1820"	"(2007-12-28 (16)) I was at this place with Calvin. We had to write down some thing for a future story. I couldn't think of anything. I started doing it and used a picture of Penn Badgley for a character. The photo looked more like Gale Harold. The teacher was annoyed at me. Sometimes Calvin was Charlene. I started writing a plot outline for the story, which again annoyed the teacher. I was then at Nana's and she said Easter eggs were in the study, which was in Poppers's room. They were little ones so I took two bigger, hollow eggs from the hall. I hid in this room and this guy saw me. I think Mom came to look for me later. I hid in a cupboard which had clothes in it."
"1821"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was in my room. Somehow I realized it was a dream and everything was vivid. I then wished my nails black for some reason, but they weren't complete so I did it myself. I then went out the back and instead of unlocking the door, I just made it unlocked. Ezra went behind the shed and so I pulled it back to get through. He found this lump of cookies and cream ice-cream and I grabbed a bit out and was eating it. Then Ezra turned the lump over and there was a cut out cube full of big maggots. I spat out my ice-cream. After, I 'woke' up and was talking to Dad and I had been talking in my sleep. The back door was also unlocked."
"1822"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was at school. These people asked me if ""Jonathan"" had asked me to this dance. I was like ""Who the hell is Jonathan?"". They said he liked me and pointed him out. He was small and ugly. I was talking to him later. Later still, I was at the car park and I saw Eugene. I went into the school again and I got lost. There were elevators."

"1824"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) Something happened and Godzilla was real. He was different though. I went into this shop with a fortune teller lady to hide. He was after me. I was running through the shop aisles. He found me and I ran with others and hid under this log thing. He wanted this kid under there too. We were face to face with him and I was hoping he wouldn't kill us."
"1825"	"(2007-12-29 (16)) I was at this place that we went to regularly. There were a bunch of different obstacles. One was this turning platform and you had to jump to the next one and you get food. There was one which would either be this easy thing to get rid of or it would be Godzilla, or a 'snake' (with water and it 'slips'). They would chase you and you could die, but we survived."
"1826"	"(2007-12-30 (16)) I was out the back and the kittens were there. This other kitten came and I pet it and it stayed. Kiki came and let me pet her. Mom was watching from the kitchen window and I was like ""It's Kiki!""."
"1827"	"(2007-12-31 (16)) There were lots of little kittens outside and I gathered them and put them into this giant cage, which had little cages in it. I then saw two crocodiles on top of the shed and a nasty looking one on top of a door. One of the two on the shed, died. Later, it was alive and I was playing with it. I went in the pool and it jumped in after me. Later, Ezra and a friend were near the pool and were going to go for a swim. Then they saw the crocodile and moved away. I said they were friendly. One of the crocodiles reminded me of Kiefer Sutherland."
"1828"	"(2007-12-31 (16)) I was at a shop. I found a notebook and I flicked through it and found a note that I had written on the 6 January 2005. I tried to show Mom but she was busy."
"1829"	"(2008-01-01 (16)) I was watching this movie with Jason Lee in it. I had read that it was about a guy who wasn't interested in women, but was interested in his 10 year old daughter. But I don't think it was. He was driving a car and his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) was in the back. She said ""Dexter?"" and Jason said ""Yes, that's my name. Dexter Morgan"" and I thought of Michael C. Hall and then that everything Jason Lee was in recently he was called Dexter. I was saying that I know him as Beaver from Dreamcatcher. Her grandma gave her ""shackles"" which were people who ""gave off good vibes""."
"1830"	"(2008-01-02 (16)) I was at school and it was Year 12. We got our timetable but it was confusing. Samantha, Calvin and I were in this room. My bag was small and had orange on it. My first class was in C3, but there were lots of C3's. People were following me to the class, but we finally found it. Eugene was there but he was in the class next door. Our class had to look after Mandy Moore. The teachers were really outgoing and treated us like kids and I knew that I was going to hate this class. Eventually, Mandy came in and the teacher was saying stuff and we had to repeat what he said. The teacher kept calling her Audrey. She went to her room and we were downstairs. This lady blew a party thing in my face and asked what was wrong. We were all standing in this line and Evelyn was in front of me. I moved a chair and left the line. Once everyone left, I got my bag and left. I realized it was a dream so I said ""No-one can see me"". I got to the front office and asked the lady how to read the timetable. She said something and then ""now you wanna get out of a draft"". I made her forget everything. This other lady had this alien thing. I gave her this ""love yourself"" card. She gave me a thank you one. Someone came in and I made him walk off. It was Carson and I was glad it wasn't Eugene."
"1831"	"(2008-01-03 (16)) I was at home. Mom and Darren were there. We thought someone was in the house and Darren saw some suspicious activity outside. These two guys came up to the house and then a car pulled up. There was a drug deal and they had heaps of drugs. This guy had weird hair that went out into a point. He went to the woodshed and was trying to get through the laundry door. He climbed in backwards and I kicked him in the bum. I told Dad and we laughed. The people threatened us and we had to all take drugs out to them. Then the main person, a lady, said she wanted 100, but would settle for 60. I told Mom then tried to go to 55. The police came and caught and arrested all of them. Someone came with a parrot and there was a message. It had blue bubbles. The guy with the hair came back another time. I heard someone in the woodshed. I was putting more stuff in the door so he couldn't open it, but it could still open enough."

I had ripped them and I put tape on them but Nana complained and took it off and put that cover stuff on. It had Pokemon on it. I discovered that just before I arrived, I had hit my head and had gone back in time. I was hoping that I didn't have to do school again."

Some guy got her (they lived underwater) and some adventure happened and she was like ""How am I going to get back?"" and he sent her back through time or something. Some baby was in an envelope under the water and there was a hole in the bottom and water poured into it."
"1834"	"(2008-01-04 (16)) I was at a friend of mine's house. It was her birthday. She had these ponds and there were walkways on top. There were lots of fish and I was telling her about how Nana had similar fish and told her about the big ones that suck on your finger. She had even bigger ones. She took a fish out and put it onto the walkway. I put it back in and said ""You're gonna kill it!"". She had a party and hadn't invited her best friend (ex) who was Leighton Meester and some stuff happened (the lights went out etc) and she suspected Leighton but it wasn't her."
"1835"	"(2008-01-05 (16)) I was with Mom somewhere. I was showing her TV shows. She liked Pushing Daisies and I was thinking that Lee Pace was hot. I was saying that season 1 concentrated more on character relationships and character. Chuck was barely in season 2. Then it was real and Mom didn't like Chuck and I think she liked Ned. I was somewhere else and it was the day before my birthday and I complained because of school and that I'd only watched two movies. I was then at Nana's with Aunt Sally and the others. We were playing cricket on an oval. Braden ran after the ball, but it was too far and she called him back. Ezra was telling Bryson about the first time he did something about South Park. The sink was full of dishes. There were some Kiefer Sutherland cards?"
"1836"	"(2008-01-05 (16)) I was in space and there was a war. Some spaceship thing was leaving and I thought it would take me to the ship that was fighting. Instead, it took me to this planet.

Ms Braun came and said something about Calvin kissing me and I was like ""ew, it's not about that. I want to go home"". There was this robot in a sleigh that went to France."
"1837"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) I went to this spooky place in a forest. I was with other people. There was a castle and we were told to sleep outside somewhere. This guy and girl (I was now not there and it was third person) went into this caravan. Later some people and some dogs went to check if people were asleep. They went in the caravan and saw them awake but left them. Then all these creatures came out from the castle. One of them was this sort of hot guy with big hair. Nana and I later found out by looking through a book that he was played by Angus Young. Later, the guy and girl went outside and this lady drove past and then people were coming that way so they went back inside and pretended to be having sex and the lady pretended to be hanging around."
"1838"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) I was at Nana's. There were kids there and they kept jumping on me and following me around. I was there with this guy called Adam (who I think was my boyfriend) and he was Kiefer Sutherland's son. He didn't look anything like him and had black hair. I was playing some game which was Mario like. I was swimming through water and there were lava and normal platforms. The water started falling and I had to jump from platform to platform."
"1839"	"(2008-01-06 (16)) Dad and Valerie met up. They talked for a bit and then started making out. Her eyes looked like Jennifer Carpenter's and I said ""She looks like Dexter's sister!"". I was thinking that I hadn't seen Farrah in a long time."
"1840"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) Ezra and I were at a beach. We were watching this movie while walking through this carpark and recognized that the movie was set here. We walked onto the sand and met with this actor guy. We were walking with him and he asked us to be in the movie with him. Ezra and I were like ""lucky we came to the beach"". The water came up and knocked us down. I was carried a while away (on the sand). He said he was doing a talk soon. I was then naked and looking for clothes. Some lady said ""Get it cut"". I found some clothes and ended up at this place and Jemma was there. She was abusing me and then touched me so I started hitting her and she fell to the ground and I walked off. I went up these stairs and realized that she was following me. She said something like that she was going to punch me over the edge. She grabbed my leg but I managed to push her over and she fell. But when I looked she had only fallen onto the steps and was still alive. Some old lady was like ""She's the victim here"" and I said ""Then so was Ted Bundy"". Lydia said the Jemma's name was Madelyn and I said that it wasn't and that I didn't mind Madelyn. Lydia was like 'what the hell?'. I was worried about getting in trouble for it, but was hoping that she had died."
"1841"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) I was at 'school'. I left my bag in some secret room. I couldn't remember how to get back. It was home time and people were everywhere."
"1842"	"(2008-01-07 (16)) We got our exam results back. I got 75% for English. I did well in the middle part and I told Mom. [I found out the next year that the top mark was 75%] ."
"1843"	"(2008-01-08 (16)) I don't remember the start, but a virus (like in 24) was released. I had a boyfriend who was Michael Cera (or at least looked like him). He thought that he was infected. I was at home which was completely different in a completely different place. There was a place in the desert where infected people went and they could kill themselves. I was with Mom at one stage and I was crying (about Michael being infected) and she was like ""maybe he's not infected"". Michael was going to go there but first Mom, Darren, Ezra, Michael and I were in the car going to the shop. Ezra had a guinea pig. Michael and I were messing around in the shop and making out. We were also singing Love Me Tender at one point. Some guy and I had a fight and I had this giant mascara thing and he had a hairdryer. Then we were in an aisle which had yoghurt topped muesli bars and we were throwing them at each other. Then I was in the music section with Mom. Some people were singing old songs and I was singing along to some parts. There was a Beatles ""number ones"" poster. There was also a Spinal Tap thing which had Christopher Guest on the front. Some lady asked Mom the best way to learn the piano. As we left the section I grabbed this big green and white candy cane, a wig and a mini-moose (Invader Zim) toy. I put on the wig and met up with Michael in the food hall. This guy was making food, which was a live animal. I realized it was an armadillo and there was one nearby. I took off the wig and jumped on the table. It went on a rampage and I was trying to kill it. I went near Michael and used a table to shield us and we managed to run out of the shop. This guy was just outside in his car. We got in and wound the windows up. It was trying to head butt through the windows. I took over driving and sat in the left side. The driver did the breaks and kept an eye on the speed, which was in miles. It was too confusing so I swapped and had to add 40 to the miles and that would be the equivalent of kilometers. We tried to get the armadillo off. It rolled the car and Michael and I got out and the car exploded. Then the driver appeared. It was dark and we were running home trying to avoid the armadillo. We got home and then I was Kim (24) and he was Chase (24) and she said to him not to come in and he said ""I thought I was past the kissing stage"". He left and then it was me again. The door wouldn't lock and the armadillo was outside. I called Mom (but it wasn't her) to help stop it from getting in. The house was shaking and we went back in time. The father was going to do something. We went outside and Sandra Bullock was in a tree with a baby. She had really long nails that were white and she was hippie like. Michael and I made out again."
"1844"	"(2008-01-09 (16)) I was out in some bush place and there was a little deli. Some guy, a girl and I were meeting there because some guy was going to give us $1.1 million for some reason. If we didn't see anyone else on the way there he was going to give us $2.2 million. The deli owner saw us though so we only got $1.1 million. The guy shot me but I didn't get shot. Then we all bought $400k houses. Then it was Sims 2 and I added the families to my play list. One said ""Eric Dane""."
"1845"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) I had gone to the UK and met The Beatles and they had to sign in a card. John Lennon was there. Then I was at 'school'. I had my Beatles shirt on and someone asked me about them. Ms Braun was doing S+E stuff. I had been away and she asked me something about antioxidant and I said ""I don't even know what antioxidant is"". She said I should've straightened my hair. She gave me DVD's of Superbad and one with Michael Cera in it and two others. I asked if I could take them home to watch (so I could burn them) and she said no. I was in a room. Some girl, Megahn Perry, David Fickas and I were there. The girl and Megahn were supposed to best friends but Megahn liked me and the other girl was annoyed. I liked the David Fickas guy and I think he liked me but he was hanging out with this other guy."
"1846"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) There was a sign on the road where all dogs were supposed to poo there so it was all in one place. People were looking for food and they were getting meat and this lady wanted more. Someone let the dogs go."
"1847"	"(2008-01-10 (16)) I was somewhere and there was a toilet which only had one side and no walls. Ezra was nearby. Then we were at the shop at Toys 'R' Us. They had this yellow Runescape boat. I was in the electronics section. They had this Beatles trivia thing and something about Audrey Tautou in Amelie. I thought it was a dream and did a reality check, but then I was out the back. Then I was at 'school'. Two girls were hugging each other. I went up some stairs and I heard ""Izzy"" and Max (Roswell) gave me an envelope and said ""It's important"". I opened it and it said that he loved me and knew my ""birthday secret"". I closed it and said I'd read it later, because it had said in there to meet him if I felt the same way. Later, I was in a car with him and a female teacher. We went to this boring lawn mower place. The teacher left. We went past my 'mother's' (not really her) work and she sold tea and it was a drive thru. She didn't give them to people my age but she let Max have one (he was a year older). The cup the tea was in was really hot but Max had no problems holding it. Godzilla and some thing went after Brendan Fehr and he said something to Max. He could make Godzilla things and clouds appear."
"1848"	"(2008-01-12 (16)) I was with the school at a shop. We were listening to a talk about aliens. Eugene, someone and I left to look for some alien artifact of mine that had been stolen. We were in an office and we found these tubes and took this thin tube thing. The lady came back and we hid behind the desk and crawled around. I ran out in time but she saw Eugene. I ran through the shop and got to a dead end so I ran the other way. I put the tube down the side of my pants and found my way back to the entrance. The lady and Eugene came. She thought we had nothing on us so she let us go. We were at some bouncy yellow and red stairs. Someone said ""it might be a dream"" and I said ""No, this is definitely not a dream"". The three of us were walking along a bridge and it was dark. Soon, I couldn't see ahead. Then I looked behind and saw this claw grab some people and I realized that the lady was taking people. I saw a claw in front of us and I tried to tell Eugene but couldn't. I fell and we were lying on the bridge holding on tight. My phone was falling out of my pocket. I was trying to think what to do and then I got this weird image of George Clooney talking. The claw grabbed me but I didn't let go. We escaped and we were later staying in a hotel. The lady found us and she inferred that some people were having sex. She made them hallucinate. Later, I was in a car with Dad and Ezra. There were lots of murderers around so we locked our doors. There were two guys near a park. Some guy was the ice truck killer (Dexter)."
"1849"	"(2008-01-13 (16)) There was a war. This youngish guy was put on a safe planet. He interrogated some females by threatening their kids. He was a good guy though. He was arranging for them all to go free. Some people were let out near this flat thing. People were shooting and these kids got shot."
"1850"	"(2008-01-13 (16)) I was at school. It was year 12 and the class numbers were weird and I didn't know where to go for physics. I saw Elijah and I was going to follow him but then remembered he didn't do physics anymore. I eventually found the class and sat down near the front. When Darius and company came they sat in front of me. Eugene came and he looked weird and his eyebrows were thick. Autumn sat next to me. There was a thing which had these profiles of ours on it. I was looking at Eugene's and reading his list of favourite movies, all of which I hadn't heard of."
"1851"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) Ezra was driving. First, we got in the car to get away from these people and he got in the drivers seat. He was going fast but controlled it. We got to this grassy place and were climbing up this very green hill. At the top there were obstacles and people were climbing them. This guy and a girl followed us up there."
"1852"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) We were going to go to some waterslides. We were out the front of home and Valerie and kids, Mom, Dad and Ezra were there too. We only had one car. Farrah got the mail and it was all for me. One was from this place to do with school. It had a bunch of names on it but the only name I recognized was Gregg. There was some mail from some Spongebob place. Ariana was in the back seat and wearing a Spongebob shirt. Farrah was in the driver's seat and Valerie was sitting on the boot. Mom and I went inside and she invited her brother so that Valerie wouldn't go. She knocked on the breakfast bar to pretend that she was knocking on the door. Then there was a real knock and Evelyn and a man (which was her father, but not really) and two dogs were there. She was talking to me and asked if I was going out and I said yes. Then there were heaps more people there. Ramona was there and I kept calling her Paul. I was yelling at the people to get out of the house and calling out for my keys. On the drive there I remembered I had my period so I decided to check how heavy I was when I got there."
"1853"	"(2008-01-14 (16)) This guy's daughter went to this dark alley place to gamble (playing poker). He went to his friends place. His friend was warning him about a killer. He locked himself in a room and the killer came and killed his friend. He thought it was a joke so reached out and touched and tasted the blood and he realized it was real. He then looked up in shock."
"1854"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I left this place with some friends and I was driving this car. It was American though, and I kept getting confused. The brakes weren't working well. Then it was this weird Segway like emergency vehicle. The traffic was stopped. I managed to get onto the road I needed to. I was then with someone who was either Kiefer Sutherland or Will Arnett. We were walking down the side of the road and then it was closed at the end. We had to climb over this thing and there was a door and he went through and I asked ""Haven't we gone through this door before?"" and he said ""No"". Then we were in this garden and there were two little Chinese hut like things on each side of the garden and each side of the garden was exactly the same. There was a black couple and they wanted us to marry their children. First, they gave us food and we fell asleep. We then dreamt and he was trying to work out who he was in love with. There was a midget called Denis. This lady told him that she thought it was me (that he was in love with). So we had sex (in the dream) and he realized that he did. He owned this video shop and they had Flatliners and two other movies with Kiefer Sutherland (looked like him, but wasn't him). Then it was real and the cops were there. We had been killed and found together in a bed. I was then discovered to be alive and sat up. Then whoever I was with was alive too. I was watching something on TV -- Will Arnett was in love with a rat. He put it in his pants and it climbed out from the bottom."
"1855"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I was at 'school' and it was the first day back. I was annoyed. It was Tuesday and I had English first. Ms Solomon said to start working. The class was weird. I was trying to find somewhere to sit. There were four rows. Elijah and Theodore were sitting on opposite ends of the third row. I sat at one end of the third row next to Theodore. I moved the desk away. I was hoping the teacher wouldn't tell me off. Eugene was talking to me at one point and when he walked away, I was thinking 'why the hell was he talking to me'. I was trying not to giggle."
"1856"	"(2008-01-15 (16)) I was out the back and jumped into the pool. I went inside and Dad was like ""What the hell happened?"" and I said that I fell in the pool. I remembered my phone was in my pocket and it was wet and squishy, but it was working."
"1857"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) I was at 'school'. We had this cooking class. I put my bag near the desk and when I went back it was gone. I was trying to ask the teacher if she knew where it went. Eventually she went looking for it. I had to cook all these different recipes. I picked this banana muffin. It had to go underwater. I had to one of those MATHS things as well. This lady was at her house and she knew all these kids Halloween costumes, so she pretended to be someone else. These two kids walked away from her house and one said ""she tries""."
"1858"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) This gay kid was friends with this guy. The gay guy was in love with him. The guy had had sex with him. They met up again and the gay guy was staying with him and his friends. He was sharing his bed. He was naked and the gay guy pushed the sheets off and was touching him. He turned the music up and the guy was just staring at the ceiling. A friend of his wanted to come in and worked out what was going on and was laughing with the other friends."
"1859"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) Darren asked me what I thought of the couples of Roswell. I said I liked the way they turned out and was thinking of Max with Liz and Eugene with Maria. I said that it was ""pretty pathetic"" but I liked it. Ezra asked me a question about how to record something."
"1860"	"(2008-01-16 (16)) I was watching some Alias thing and there was a picture of Jenny in a cheerleading outfit. Will was with his parents and he was trying to explain why his girlfriend (Jenny) wasn't there."
"1861"	"(2008-01-17 (16)) I was watching a movie called 'Sad School'. It started off with these people in an underground carpark place but it wasn't underground. They jumped into the street and then these people ran out of a shop with zombies after them. There were heaps of zombies around. This lady worked out that if you stood up straight it would attract them so she and this girl walked like hunchbacks and got past them. They got a deal with a zombie so that they and other survivors could live in this school as long as they made no noise or were seen. This guy got turned and told this lady that it wasn't pleasant. He was green and warty. This girl got kissed and her mouth went warty. The street was crowded with zombies and they all went after them. This lady went into the back seat of a police car. The front window was down and she was trying to push it up. They kept going down though, so she had to keep pushing them up. There was a male zombie outside. She managed to get out but he chased her. She ended up in this store which only had two walls and then she was a guy. Michael Cera was then there and a guy in a wheelchair was facing the other way. The girl who had turned into the guy said he was the only person who could look after the guy in the wheelchair. It was his son. So the zombies were like ""Well it's your son or Michael'. I was like ""Give them wheels!"". Dad asked if the main lady died. I said that I didn't know and that I thought she did. There was a catchy song in it. At the school where the survivors were, there was a guy in a cage. A helicopter flew over one day and the zombies got suspicious. The people decided to leave but first they had to delete their files. They went to this place but somehow the wall got knocked down and they were all standing. Later I was in the lounge room and the sequel was on. Dad was watching it and Ezra was there. There was a list of music and there was a song I liked on there. In the sequel there was a cop who was the brother of a cop in the first one (and he looked like he was related to Kevin Dillon). It was really random and boring. Jeremy Piven was driving a car and yelling into a phone."
"1862"	"(2008-01-17 (16)) I was at a place and we were sitting in cars. Poppa was there. Ezra, Mom and I went to the shop and got school bags. We had video cameras too. My tape was almost full. They had this bad guy and Poppa asked to record him while he made a phone call. I gave him Ezra's tape."
"1863"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I was living by myself at home. But then it was some other house. We did something to the roof (changed the pattern and stuff). This new guy across the road copied, but it was a little bit different. Ezra got a new car and the guy got a similar one. The door to my house was this stingy thing with cloth which blew about. I had this little table outside. The guy took it and I took it back. He came over and wanted me to come to his place and I said no. He came back a little while later with these two really big chickens. I called Mom and told her to get me. The chickens came in and were like dogs. I was screaming and went outside. I then said ""Ok! I'll go to your place!"" and he took them off."
"1864"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I went to this place with a guy friend I liked. He wanted to work in ""entertainment"" (all jobs had categories). I went down this slide which would measure my ""sweet"" and how much of something else I produced. My sweet and the other thing were almost the same which some guy said was ""excellent""."
"1865"	"(2008-01-18 (16)) I was at Max, Isobel and Eugene's (all from Roswell) house. I was helping with the gardening. There was this big container with plant pots in it. I didn't know much water to put in. Later there were plant pots near a shed. I thought I might water the grass. This frog had died in the container along with the plants. Their 'mother' gave us tea with superglue and sugar in it. Isobel was then at some place and had to distract this guy called Matt. She was hiding behind some bushes. I think they could change form too."
"1866"	"(2008-01-19 (16)) I was in a car with a young Kiefer Sutherland and some others. We found out that I may have been related to him. He went to this neighbourhood, which was creepy, to look for an old lady. The houses were all falling apart and some had skeletons (real) hanging on the front of their doors. We went into this house and a female friend got left behind (we had to run to the car). Kiefer was talking about 'breeding' with me. His house was huge. Chloe (24) was there. She met with this guy on a balcony. Someone got a mint chocolate chip mint ice-cream and I decided I wanted one. We all went to get one. It was dark and the place was closed. It had animals in cages. We opened the cage and then had to put the animals back. Mom, Dad and Ezra were there. Mom was behind us. I wanted to be friends with this girl but she was best friends with this other girl. There was a hot tub in the house. Someone followed someone and this policeman interrogated the bad guy."
"1867"	"(2008-01-19 (16)) I was at Nana's. We were getting the photos off the camera and onto her computer. They were photos that I had taken. Mom was deleting the movement before the photo. Then I was at some place where people from school were and I was taking photos. I had photos of Daryl, Dewey, Kirsten and others. We went on a bus and someone said something about wanting a boyfriend and then this guy walked past and she was like ""ooh, him!"" He stood at the front of the bus and I said ""I think he's going to kill us"". He did something and the bus started rolling backwards so I got to the door and got out. It rolled off this jetty into the water. The guy made me go with him. I called the police but didn't tell them where the guy was. The police saw him though and we started running. There was a fair place and he was running through all these 'rides' and we got separated, but met up later. Then we were Smurfs. I was little and had red hair. He said something about me being 7 and he being 30. We were jumping on this hat to go this place where the police couldn't see us. He said something about kissing and having sex with me and he was holding me. Then we were at a shop and there was another Smurf. There was nacho flavoured ice-cream. This guy made bad guys eat it. The police came because he was saying he was the killer."
"1868"	"(2008-01-20 (16)) I was watching 24. Chloe's ex-husband was Josh Weinstein (Entourage) and Jack didn't like him. Chloe kept talking to Edgar in her head and replaying certain things he'd said. She was like ""Stop it!"". The terrorists had planted fake information on the attack and suddenly all of CTU was gone except for Josh. He called the terrorists and said he had embedded the real information for them on Maeby Funke's (Arrested Development) site. He said that she was ""a little toughie"". She worked it out, though and did SOS signals from the fridge. Jason Bateman was sitting in a car outside the hotel Maeby was at. The terrorists realized that Maeby had found it, so sent off the missile early. I was then looking at pictures of Michael Cera. There were pictures of him young and his eyes were different."
"1869"	"(2008-01-20 (16)) I woke up and Dad was going to work late and he was talking to me but my voice was all sleepy and I didn't know what was going on."
"1870"	"(2008-01-21 (16)) I made this chip that could let us do anything. Some girl stole it and Mom, Ezra and I went after her. We were driving but then we lost her. Her sick old grandma was in a car with her. We went to this place and there were lots of old people around. Ms Bigwood was there. Then it was a movie and this old couple was talking. It turned out that the chip had made everyone stay at their current age (forever)."
"1871"	"(2008-01-22 (16)) I had gone on a dating show and had met this hot guy called Steven and he had chosen to go on the second date with me. We were in a car and Ezra was there too. We were talking but told Ezra to leave. Later, people kept playing this game out the front of the house across the road. People kept joining in and then leaving. A black girl was there. This car was coming past and people were drunk. I went back inside. Dad was there. I was then at this other house that I think was Mom's. I was getting rid of stuff on my bed by putting it under the blanket. Then I was Max (Roswell). He and his mother were getting stuff out of his drawers. There was a broken lightbulb and he held it and fixed it. Then I was me again and was wondering when Steven was coming. Simba was on my bed. I was watching some show and this guy and girl were in a shop and were going to have sex behind a curtain. Everyone was cheering. The girl took her shirt off and then the curtain opened. There was a photo of Braden somewhere and he looked like a cross between Charlton Heston and Peter Weller."
"1872"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) This couple had a son and a daughter and they were living in this cool house. Something happened and they were worried that something was going to happen to them. They had tunnels hidden in the house incase they needed to hide. They heard a noise and sent the kids down the tunnel. Two men came and one was Tom Lennox (24) and realized they had sent the kids down the tunnel. But he knew them before so he didn't say anything. They had nuclear bombs. A woman got shot. I was telling Mom, Darren and others about it later."
"1873"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) I had more texts from Dad about Heath Ledger being dead."
"1874"	"(2008-01-23 (16)) I drove to Dad's 'work'. This guy jumped into the passenger seat and asked if I had any 'E'. I was like ""Huh?"". He said ecstasy and I was like ""Why the hell would I have that?!"". He got out and was talking to his friends and they said I was cool. I went to this cheesecake shop and Evelyn worked there. I said it was nice in here because it was cool and had mud cakes. Evelyn was talking to me about the seating on the bus and that I always sat next to Calvin. Then we got on a plane and it was going around in circles. There were some Spanish guys. We then ran into an antiques shop and when we left it there was a swamp. I jumped over onto a ladder and there were retards hanging on to different obstacles. I had to swing onto this thing and get past a lady."
"1875"	"(2008-01-24 (16)) I was at 'school'. We were at this shop (that was at the school) and all these celebrities were there. Dad shook Jack Nicholson's hand, then I did. He had rings on, but I shook his hand anyway. Kevin Spacey was there too. Someone was found dead and we were all being wary of the killer. Most people left and it was just me, the teachers and some students. Whitaker from Roswell was there but she was called Topolsky. Then there was this guy called Ned and he looked like Miko Hughes. Topolsky told me to lock him in this room with all our school bags because she thought he was the killer. I locked it and then unlocked it, but she saw me and did it herself and guarded the door. I suspected her of being the killer and I went to the other side of the shop and left. She had followed me and was waiting outside. She started chasing me. I didn't know where to go and just kept running. I ended up at these tennis courts. I yelled out to everyone that ""Topolsky is the killer!"". They laughed and were confused. Then she came and she had a gun to this male teacher's head. I pointed at them and finally the people looked. We all started running and she was shooting at us. I kept hiding behind things. Then she got hold of a machine gun and she now looked like Mia Kirshner. I was hiding behind this little metal thing. I asked ""how many bullets does that hold?"" and someone said ""500"". Then it was a keyboard. She had modified it to act as a machine gun. I grabbed it and she disabled it. She grabbed another keyboard and we were having a fight with them. Then she planted this bomb which plugged into the power socket. I called out for someone to disable the power and the principal guy said no and I realized that he was a part of it. We ran and the bomb had only been set for 3 seconds or something, then the school exploded. I had managed to get to the front of the school and it was North Midvale Primary School. I started walking home. There was a black guy on the street too. I decided to go back to the school and help. I called Mom on my mobile and she was like ""Yeah, I'm coming to get you"". I said ""A bomb just went off at the school! I don't know who's dead or alive"" and I was crying. I got off the phone and was walking through the rubble. Brendan Fehr came out of the rubble and I said ""What's your name?"" and he said ""Ben"". I saw Ned and woke him up and he said that his mothers cover was now blown and he asked if I could take him to my 'father' who was a doctor. I grabbed him and said that he was small. I was reading something about Pushing Daisies and everyone was like ""Where's the real Ned?"". Someone said, about the Miko Hughes Ned, ""You rule. You're my favourite because of your smile""."
