"0492"	"(2006-01-28 (15)) I was at some place and I fell into some tube tunnel thing. The Beatles were hanging around. John Lennon and Paul McCartney got trampled the most and I gave George a hug before he got trampled. John and Paul started walking back and I said ""Hello, don't worry I won't mug you!"" Then I was at a school and I'd been away for a while. I had to sit next to Cedric. There was lots of paper. We were laughing because of Ezra. There were trophies. The people there were giving this girl there chocolate. This girl and guy were psychic. They were in a car and someone had a dream about a bar."
"0493"	"(2006-01-29 (15)) There was a mud monster at a hotel. Then I was at Mom's, as was the mud thing. I was climbing up the poles, and it was following me. I got in the car and it grabbed onto the door. I drove to the dump to get rid of it."
"0494"	"(2006-01-30 (15)) Mom called me to go to some woman's house, which had a messy yard. I was talking in an Irish accent. Mom was somewhere writing letters. She signed it Evelyn? People were in shelters, but I don't know why. Mom came to Nana's one."
"0495"	"(2006-02-02 (15)) I was watching Kenny vs. Spenny. There was a movie and there was a shop with spells. Nobody really liked Kenny. Spenny was following a girl and her boyfriend stole food. Kenny was making spells."
"0496"	"(2006-02-03 (15)) I was friends with Ezra and we were at the library at school. He decided to stay at Brookland High School. We were going through a carpark and I dropped my shoes, so I went back and got them. Then we dropped Ezra's shoes and a lady took one, but I got it back. She kept trying to break my arm. These people were running from the bad guys, and some were getting killed. This guy hid in a strange place. Someone didn't believe something (that I don't remember) was down these holes. There was something to do with bread. Nana was waiting for a helicopter. I was angry at some person and some dude was laughing because I was angry."
"0497"	"(2006-02-04 (15)) I was at some place. I was in a group for school. Daryl was in my group. I left my diary somewhere. Someone brought it over. Daryl stitched something into the cover. I can't remember properly but it said ""from your loving mother, Daryl"". He was going to Hull for two weeks starting January 1."
"0498"	"(2006-02-05 (15)) It was nighttime. Dad went psycho. We had meetings at Mom's house. Dad threatened to shoot us and Mom stabbed him. His body was never found. Some person and I ran a shop. These guys were waiting. One of the guys came out and raped and killed my friend, but I managed to get away. I found this other rapist who, after bribing him to leave me alone, I started going out with. We were at a place for Grim Reapers. I was there, but I wasn't dead. Not everyone there was a Grim Reaper. These guys were making fun of me."
"0499"	"(2006-02-13 (15)) Someone was in the house and I thought it was Calvin and it was. He was being nice etc, but then ended up at some place with a portal thing. He was looking for some dead girl in ice."
"0500"	"(2006-02-15 (15)) I got a job at Red Rooster. I was there, and Mr Norris worked there. This guy hung up a rack and said ""Congratulations"". I was like ""What do I do now?"" and he said ""Nothing, wait for training""."

"0502"	"(2006-02-17 (15)) I found out that Payton liked me when I was younger. His mother said he ""loved me so much that he couldn't kiss me"" and that he always liked me. I was like 'What the hell?'."

He was in my class and form, along with Calvin, Silas and Samantha. I filtered these two bits of rubbish. There was a fluffy microscope and lots of little kids."
"0504"	"(2006-02-19 (15)) I wanted to get to Fiji, which was the shape of the island in The Truman Show. Some person and I were pretending to be from Fiji because we had someone's luggage."
"0505"	"(2006-02-19 (15)) I was at Granma's and she had my school photos from Year 3 and 5. I took them and also found some more cool photos. Ezra and I were on this thing, like the top floor bit of a barn. It had movies and books on it. There were three kids down below, and Ezra and I were throwing stuff at them. Ezra was singing 'The Weight'."
"0506"	"(2006-02-19 (15)) I was watching The Devil's Rejects and I was in it, like I was watching the movie inside it. I kept touching Otis because he is hot. Then it was real and I don't know."
"0507"	"(2006-02-22 (15)) I won $620,000, $1,000 and $7 on three different scratchies. I brought them to a news agency to check if they were real. I had to get the money $2 a month. Evelyn won $200,000. I was in a car with Mom, and it was cold. There was something about an iPod. I dreamt everything again, but it was different."

Everyone was hugging me. It was Samantha's birthday. There was a bomb with chicken? Something was jumping over something to the end. There was a squishy table. [My notes were extremely messy] ."
"0509"	"(2006-02-27 (15)) This guy parachuted into our yard and he looked like Michael Palin as the It's man. Someone was watching an adult movie. The parachuting guy accidentally landed in water. Heaps of people died. I was there too, but I was ok."
"0510"	"(2006-03-01 (15)) I was at this place and most people were under 15. It was all playground like. There were a couple of older people. Everyone there was supposed to be gay. I wasn't and I saw this guy on an escalator, and he saw me. We both kept trying to meet each other. We found out why everyone was like this, but I can't remember why. I finally met the guy in this 'ball'."
"0511"	"(2006-03-01 (15)) I was at school and I went to the toilet and the cubicles had no walls. People were complaining about CS [I don't know what it is] ."
"0512"	"(2006-03-01 (15)) Someone had high hit points. We had form and I kept going to Evelyn and Silas's. Someone was getting paid $50 an hour. Mr Norris gave Jake money. He gave me $275 and he gave Samantha $6200. The amount he gave her was a mistake. There was a naked girl with an orange face."
"0513"	"(2006-03-03 (15)) This guy with a chainsaw was hiding in this cupboard thing. He had been after us before but we got away."

"0516"	"(2006-03-03 (15)) We were standing outside this house, which told Ezra to go to the top floor for presents. He thought it was a trap but he went anyway. I went up and fell down. I yelled at Ezra to come down. There was a bath in there letting out water."
"0517"	"(2006-03-06 (15)) Our school was actually this evil school like in The Outer Limits. The people that went to the school all had gone 'straight'. Daryl, some random nerdy dude, a girl, someone else and I hadn't been converted. We decided to escape. Daryl and I tried to get the other people. The nerdy dude caught us and brought himself along. Daryl was trying to get his brother. We got to a park."
"0518"	"(2006-03-06 (15)) Daryl, some person and I were at this house. The lights were out. Daryl turned into a dinosaur. We ran off. Later he wasn't a dinosaur and this other person was. Then lots of people were. I was at this restaurant and you had to get a ticket and then pass through this thing. Daryl turned into a butterfly. People from Year 1 were there. Daryl and I ran off to these woods and found this thing. He went inside a tent. I went to this toilet. Tanita and this guy came in. There were guards near my cubicle. She got raped or something."
"0519"	"(2006-03-09 (15)) Jayson came to Red Rooster, where I worked. Samantha and Silas were outside. Jayson was talking to me and he was saying that he wasn't going to be back again, and that's why he was here, to say goodbye to Ezra. He said he was going with this under-21 gay thing. I was like ""What the flip?"" He said ""Oh yeah, you don't know I'm gay. And I was like ""What the flip?"" again. He also told Mom and then Ezra. We were all shocked that he was gay."
"0520"	"(2006-03-10 (15)) I was in a classroom and I was sitting in a group with Evelyn, Calvin and someone, Daryl and someone else. I had a video camera and all our faces looked green. The camera wouldn't record. Max Schreck and Alfred Hitchcock were making a movie together."
"0521"	"(2006-03-10 (15)) Silas got moved to my health class, but not to my Phys Ed class. But in Phys Ed, he was there. He was asked to go get these two girl things (called Appley) and to see Max Schreck and Alfred Hitchcock (it was a different dream though). I told Evelyn that I wanted to go with him. He then asked if I could come with him. We went down, but he kept getting distracted. Calvin joined us, and then Calvin and I made it to this storage place. We found Silas and then Seamus came in. We didn't know what to get. Samantha and her 'clone' said they didn't know either."
"0522"	"(2006-03-12 (15)) Mom, Darren, Ezra, Jayson and I were at the 'zoo'. It was inside, I think. It was all water animals and you got a sheet to tick off which animals you touched. Some of the animals listed were electric eel and jellyfish. I didn't want to touch any of the scary ones (ie, jellyfish). Mom got angry at me."
"0523"	"(2006-03-12 (15)) There were fairies in the pool. Twice a year they would give out these wipes which would let you fly for a while. There were wipes with Dolly and Girlfriend in a bag. It got stuck, but then it continued to fall. Samantha was telling me about some hot guy she had met, and then she realized it was her cousin."
"0524"	"(2006-03-12 (15)) Ezra and I were playing out the front of Mom's house and a limo turned up. Johanna and her family stepped out."
"0525"	"(2006-03-16 (15)) Calvin was running this thing at school but he sucked, so the teacher was getting people to vote for a new person. Nothing happened though. I saw Eugene kissing Cassie, and then again at a car as well. I got a hotdog and I couldn't find any tomato sauce."
"0526"	"(2006-03-18 (15)) The school was at the Royal Show. I had to do a project on how fast this ride went. It was really gay. We had to wear gloves. I didn't have any money. All of our bags were together; one had Hrvatski written on it. Samantha held my gloves. Nana was running a deli there. Elijah got a chocolate. Nana said she would pay for me."
"0527"	"(2006-03-19 (15)) I was at a museum and me and someone had to sneak past these people to get in. Someone had to deliver a letter to me. I hid behind a door, and then ran out to the car. The car was actually a four-wheeler, except it was different. Dad and Ezra were already on it. I hated it. We went to an ice-cream shop. They made one for Ezra and he didn't like it because it wasn't 'tight enough'. Dad tried to give it to me and I kept saying ""I don't like chocolate ice-cream""."
"0528"	"(2006-03-21 (15)) There were lots of tornadoes. I was running away from them and ended up in a bunker place. There were these parents and a kid there. The mother was called Astric and she was a quadriplegic. The kid was called Rottic and had AIDS. They all got killed. Tornadoes were going to wipe out the Earth. Rascal was near this snake. Calvin, Silas, Samantha and I were at a shop?"
"0529"	"(2006-03-22 (15)) I was in the dining room and the pool table was in there, with letters on it. Daryl messed it up and I was setting it out and he was sitting with me and I was listening to music. I went to the toilet and something was peeing in the sink in the bathroom. When I went back, Daryl had changed the music because he thought it was gay. My phone had something about Donald Brown (an ugly townie Sim on Sims 2). Calvin and Silas were around somewhere too."
"0530"	"(2006-03-25 (15)) There was thing at school and we got paired up with people. I don't know who I got paired up with first, but this particular time I got paired with Eugene. He was on a computer playing Runescape and I said that I'd been playing for 3 years [in reality, almost 2 years, in the dream I was telling the truth though] . When he got off we were talking about it. He also played Sims 2. There was all this water around. We were in this canoe and it was broken. Someone threw bags out of a window (of a house that had cars in it) and onto another boat. Daryl was in Calvin's class. Ezra was in a line for the computers. The next time I got paired up with Samantha and I was angry about it. I was watching the episode of The Outer Limits with Colin Mochrie in it, but it wasn't him."
"0531"	"(2006-03-26 (15)) I was in a village. This crazy blue zombie guy started biting people and within five minutes, I was the only one left (the last guy that got bit, I killed). Calvin was around too and I found a normal guy lying around so we took him with us and ran off. Blue zombies chased us and they had lasers in their eyes. We ended up at this village, where all the buildings were completely empty. There was a big door and fencing all around the outside. We put the guy down in a room and tried to check if he was bitten. He turned blue, so I stabbed him with a fork I had in my pocket. Some people we knew knocked on the door and we let them in. I assigned jobs to people, as I 'founded' the place. Some people went to get food, but Calvin and I ended up going outside the village to get food and got caught by these evil monkey people. I managed to escape. There were puffer fish, crabs etc on the edge of this island. People were making beds. I ended up getting caught again. I escaped on a giant donut at the last minute (before they killed me). I found out that Daryl was at another village and I wanted to rescue the people from there."
"0532"	"(2006-03-26 (15)) I was in this spacecraft which was like a plane, but wasn't. It happened twice -- once was real life, and the other was a The Outer Limits episode. The first time the computer had taken over and it kept going higher and higher and we went past clouds and the danger zone. When we past the danger zone it started beeping. We smashed the computer and regained control. The second time, there were two groups of people. One group was good, the other was bad. The bad people got control of it, and they were smashing the computer up."
"0533"	"(2006-03-29 (15)) I think I turned into a boy. I went to the toilet. Silas, Calvin and I did something but I can't read what I wrote. There was also something about Elijah."
"0534"	"(2006-03-30 (15)) Calvin, Silas and I were walking to Mom's. We found a dying rat. I was upset and wanted to take it to a vet, but we didn't. We fell off these rock things. There was this ecoscientist carpenter guy. We went into his house and he caught us. I tried to talk to my way out of it."
"0535"	"(2006-03-30 (15)) This lady used magic. She had all these wooden sculpture things. Daniel Cerny was there. He thought they were all cool."
"0536"	"(2006-03-31 (15)) We had a test in science except it wasn't. The teacher was going through my book and I was supposed to be giving a talk and everyone was annoyed. She realized that I was doing well and gave me a level 7 instead of a level 2. I got tomato sauce on my new shirt. I sat next to Calvin with the seating plan given for the test."
"0537"	"(2006-04-03 (15)) I went to the shop. Daryl and his family were there. I had had a feeling that they were going to be there so I had put on a bra (which I always do anyway). I went to the toilet and Gilbert was bragging about some girl. Daryl punched him. There was some 'bbb' thing in a hat. I was watching Whose Line is it Anyway and Colin Mochrie was on."
"0538"	"(2006-04-04 (15)) Ezra was abducted by aliens and was taken to the moon. Later, Mom and I ended up there. That was a big golf course and I was wondering about golf ball complaints. The people that had taken Ezra had a group and all the members had to have a middle name beginning with 'Y'. There were cat uniforms. I went to join and there was a Year 12 guy from school. Some people died 700km in the air and they were asleep? People were falling off the moon. I got abducted too. Calvin, Elijah and Silas were there too. We went on some bumper cars. We stuffed them up so we left. There was some game in the water called Squidder. My nose was burning and I smelled this soup thing. Nana was there. There was a game where you shoot a brick and then you put it into this thing. There was a German girl and her middle name began with an 'H'."
"0539"	"(2006-04-06 (15)) There was an airplane that was going to some place called Jollymont. There was this African place with lava. Jack Nicholson was there and his arm was all weird. The plane was put on autopilot. There was a camp place with evil people. Calvin and I were looking for a phone. We were throwing toys at a bad guy. There was a restaurant and a girl was in this thing. Some guy's wife or mother found her."
"0540"	"(2006-04-07 (15)) I was on a bus with the school. I got off at a restaurant place and so did Dmitri. I went to see Nana and Dmitri went to a family reunion thing. It turned out that he was related to me, but we were cousins '50 million' times removed. Someone was wearing pajama shorts. His family's last name was Selfish (not his, but far up in his family tree)."
"0541"	"(2006-04-08 (15)) Daryl, Tanita, someone and I were in a plane thing because of a war. There was an underground carpark. They took us to an underground bunker type of thing. More people came. Some people were building a fence. Michael Palin was there. Evil people came so the people stopped building. These hitmen were trying to convince this person to stray from the group."
"0542"	"(2006-04-09 (15)) It was Monday, 10/4/06. Ezra went to school but I didn't. That night, Mom dropped me off at this house where Ezra was. The 'father' was crazy and kept threatening to kill us. We tried to escape over this lake thing, but he was there. We made brownies. I kept calling Mom to pick us up and she finally said ok. Valerie and her kids were there. There was something about Disney. There was something at a beach."
"0543"	"(2006-04-10 (15)) I was swinging on vines near the cars at school. People were watching and Daryl was there. He said ""How dare you say such a thing"" and laughed. Elijah and Calvin were there too. I was looking for my bag. I didn't know what time it was. I had math, but I had science in a different class. There was this after dinner thing. Everyone had been drinking, even Ezra, except for me. I was getting my desk at 'school' ready to sleep on. There were some Monty Python commentaries on and I taped them. I had dreams of people in cartoon form and they were in a tree and there was something about a foot. There was this creature with a pear for an eye."
"0544"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) I went for a really long drive to this place in the country. The people had a lot of teenage boys and cats. I discovered that they looked after virtual pets. One cat of mine was really skinny and not well because I didn't play the game that it was on. The rest of mine were cute and fluffy."
"0545"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) George Harrison's car was in our driveway. I don't know if he was dead or alive. The car caught fire and we had twenty people from school sleeping in Ezra's room. Dad told me to wake them all and get them calm and out the back. I got them to the back door but then I went out and was getting the cats out and the rest ran off. Tinkerbell was back and I was cuddling her. Dad hadn't called the fire people."
"0546"	"(2006-04-12 (15)) I was in the library at school. I put a book for someone in there. They turned it into a library book and I was angry and I went to the principal, but he refused to do anything and so I ripped it up."
"0547"	"(2006-04-14 (15)) There were aliens out the front of our house practicing stealing cars. They took Ezra, Mom and I and put us in this place with heaps of aliens. He let Mom and this alien go. We were in this place which looked like the back of a pub. But they didn't know that. We moved slightly and I said something like ""This is gonna be a good night!"". This guy came out and asked who said that. This girl said it was her. He didn't believe her and I walked away. He said something 'naughty' about my butt. I went to go to the toilet and he followed me. I ran out, but couldn't run fast enough. A girl had seen him before and got help. Gilbert was there."
"0548"	"(2006-04-14 (15)) Granma had this presentation. I think she was doing hers on The Beatles. Ryan Cartwright was around and I kept re-meeting him (Run Lola Run, Sliding Doors kind of thing). Ezra and I were somewhere and there were snakes and I think Ezra got stung by a bee. There were these jumpers lying around. Someone said to someone else that the presentation should be about ideas rather than singing a song. Some girl asked me what songs The Beatles were singing. There was some voting thing."
"0549"	"(2006-04-15 (15)) I went to the toilet at school. It had a little tourism shop and cafe and the toilets had a see through door and a shower. I was told that it was a Year 11 and 12 toilet. I accidentally went back later. I had to climb a ladder to S+E but it was gone.  There was an assembly and people were randomly called up to play music. Calvin and I were moving around."
"0550"	"(2006-04-15 (15)) I was somewhere, and then I was home. This police guy got killed. Me, and possibly others, were looking for people and everywhere was dark. I realized that it was a dream and then the lights were working, but there were still no people. I was then in the lounge room and I woke up [I was dreaming within the dream] and started watching TV. There was some show with Ryan Cartwright on. Ezra was there too. There was some other show about a bunny and the father got killed in a fire and the baby bunny recovered."
"0551"	"(2006-04-16 (15)) I was at home and I was out the back. Calvin and I were throwing poo at each other. Ezra and some friends were in the dining room. Someone was going to watch a video."
"0552"	"(2006-04-16 (15)) Mom gave me and Ezra these fluffy rings with layers. We could teleport to exact addresses as long as no-one was watching. There were seven sheets. I went to this house which I thought was from The Ring [but it was actually The Grudge] . There were cops next door and they had lots of doors. There were these puzzles and I kept losing."
"0553"	"(2006-04-17 (15)) I had a sleepover at Mom's. Evelyn was there. We were going to play a game. The lights were out and a streaker ran past. There was a girl there that I didn't like. We went to this place and she couldn't eat fruit or lettuce because of something that I did to her. We couldn't leave until we made her a drink. There was an axe through the thermos. She was trying to give Evelyn drugs. This game we played had different rules than she was used to."
"0554"	"(2006-04-18 (15)) I was watching Seriously Weird or something but I could touch stuff. I was touching Ryan Cartwright's hair and stuff (nothing nambla). I was thinking how cool this was. Then, we had known each other for ages and we were going out. He went to this school and I wanted to go and an interview was required. I was late and kept getting interrupted. There was a Chicken Treat nearby. The guy saw a photo of me, with Calvin and Silas, except the order was me, Calvin, Silas, and Calvin again. Silas and I were standing close and he asked who he was and I said ""Silas, a friend"" and he said ""I don't believe you"". Someone had an ear infection."
"0555"	"(2006-04-20 (15)) We had to do this race for school. Samantha, Silas, John Lennon, someone else and I were on a team. I got pictures of Ryan Cartwright and some were from movies. In one of the movies, he was gay. In another movie, Ben Mendelsohn was also in it. A guy lit his house on fire, then he changed to Ryan Cartwright and I was there."
"0556"	"(2006-04-20 (15)) I was at Nana's as were people from school. I was somewhere watching Nosferatu which had completely random added dialogue. Then it turned colour and I complained. We had sports photos taken and we had to line up depending on how good you are. Daryl was in a bus alone. I asked him if he wanted to come with us. We went down this sand and waited for Dad, but a bus came."
"0557"	"(2006-04-21 (15)) I was at Granny's old house. It was a bit dilapidated and very different. There was a door that had never been opened. Granny and Nana came and Ezra and I had to climb a wall to get in. We had to find dolls. Nana and Granny finally came up. There was this new shop. Gramps appeared and everything went black and white. There was something about Christopher Walken."
"0558"	"(2006-04-21 (15)) This guy was chasing me through this carpark because I saw something. Mackenzie was running backwards. She had a gun which had no bullets. Some people were playing golf. This cat had cute kittens."
"0559"	"(2006-04-23 (15)) I went to the movies with Dad, Calvin and Ryan Cartwright or Daryl. Dad ended up being replaced with someone. We couldn't find the movie we wanted to see (which was called Dynasty Digger). I was thinking back to a previous time when we went with Jayson and Ezra. Ryan or Daryl and I were making out and messing around. We went to KFC. Later, we went to a McDonald's and Dad was making out with some really ugly new girl. We were eating, and some girl didn't want meat. I was playing this annoying Mario game."
"0560"	"(2006-04-24 (15)) Dad was low on money, and Dad, Ezra and I broke into Acquaintance-F-11's house to steal some seeds because she had cool trees or something. I was in the study and Ezra and Dad were across the hall. I was putting stuff under the desk incase she came so that I could hide, but she came in and hit me. We explained what we were doing."
"0561"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) Slitherman was out of the tank. Everyone was playing with it but it kept chasing me up the stairs and through the doors. The same thing happened with a little crow later, but I liked the bird."
"0562"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) Ezra went out to play and left a rib in the oven which was going to take four hours. I was supposed to watch the rib for him."
"0563"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) I was at Nana's and she had these Beavis and Butthead 'dolls' which could fart. Nana had this drink and she said to drink it if you were in a ""bad relationship""."
"0564"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) I think I was half asleep, but I put my foot out of the blanket and some creepy thing licked it (it was Tigger in real life, but I didn't know she was there)."
"0565"	"(2006-04-25 (15)) I had photos of Wonderland, the shop. I went back to it, from the photo, and I was peeking through the window to see if they had 'Grey's'."
"0566"	"(2006-04-26 (15)) I was playing a pre-made Sims 2 family. One of them was a witch and was using the energizers. Her sister was in the family bin. They both thought that the other wasn't related to them. The evil one turned into a chocolate bunny and was labeled as ""The Wicked Witch of the East"". The other one was a normal chocolate thing. There were heaps of other eggs which I took since I didn't get many for Easter. This black girl had paper on her hair. Dad called. I was in a car with Mom and she came and there was a cute puppy."
"0567"	"(2006-04-27 (15)) I was at some place with Calvin, Fang, Evelyn and Silas. I was lining up to go on a boat, and we were petting chickens while we waited. Calvin went on the boat by himself and Evelyn was upset. She went in the back of one with me and Fang (who wanted to go with me). Silas was serving dip, cheese, gherkins and crackers. The gherkin was yucky. He got sick of doing it and gave the job to Duane. Silas had been working there since the place opened. I saw this grim reaper guy and I asked who he was here for and he told me. Later, the guy told us he knew he was going to die. Some girl was on this bouncy thing."
"0568"	"(2006-04-27 (15)) I was at this house and I was running from these guys, locking doors and trying to stealthily avoid them."
"0569"	"(2006-04-28 (15)) I was at the zoo, but it was a different zoo, and Ezra and I had been there before. The controls were wrong (temperature etc). Ezra held this baby lion. All of the animals chucked a spaz. We ran through a pipe and the lion ma chased us. Timmy was asking why we didn't say anything to him."
"0570"	"(2006-04-28 (15)) The Queen was sitting in a chair, in a room full of chairs occupied by other people. She was all spotty. Someone walked into her. She smelled. People from school and I were writing a bible and reading out loud."

"0575"	"(2006-05-04 (15)) Evelyn wrote down on a piece of paper who she liked, who I think was Darius. Somehow, the class got a hold of it, but no-one said anything. I was friends with Ryan Donowho and we were at the beach. Evelyn was there too and he was annoyed that she was there. I think later that either Darius or Ryan started hanging with Evelyn and ended up liking her. Then Mischa Barton was talking with someone in Mom's room."
"0576"	"(2006-05-05 (15)) The car broke. This guy took it to his house and said that he was going to fix it. I had to get some stuff. I had a feeling he was going to kill us and I saw that Samantha and Calvin had their bags down near the garage. I asked to go to the toilet so that I could get my bag. Later, as we were getting ready to leave, he had a premonition of us leaving. We ran and it ended up just me and Calvin. We ended up at these tents. One was a pub, one had babies and one was a dinner place. The pub was gay. We went to the dinner place and Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus were there. Darius walked in and sat with Elijah and Dmitri. I was worried that the army was going to come in and the guy would get us. People at the baby place were looking for the people from A Series of Unfortunate Events. One of the babies was called Klaus. This older girl's baby was found in the woods. We were trying to find somewhere to stay. There was a Diner Dash type of dinner -- people had stars for their mood etc."

His wife was looking at photos. I was at his friend's house and I caught him making out with this fat lady. Her father came home and we hid the fat lady. I was turning on the lights and none of them were working. I thought it was a dream and then they worked. Then there was this giant ice-lady and she grabbed me. I turned into ice. She was 'icing' everyone else. I managed to control her and then she melted."
"0579"	"(2006-05-07 (15)) Someone at school called Bob Wiley died. We had an assembly and we had to stand for God, and then there was holy music. There was a mini funeral. I was talking to this other guy called Bob and I forgot the name of the guy that died."
"0580"	"(2006-05-07 (15)) I was at Mom's and there were three guys who all had the last name ""Pritchard"". One of them was called Eugene, but wasn't the 'real' Eugene Pritchard.

Ezra wanted something, but I don't remember what."

"0585"	"(2006-05-15 (15)) There was a cat, who was Widget but wasn't, and it shot itself. It had two legs. Then I was in this place and there was no-one there, except for a few people. Everyone had been put into these categories. All of the categories were full. It was spooky, and I went to this shop and Jake Gyllenhaal was there. He was angry, but I wanted to get his autograph."
"0586"	"(2006-05-18 (15)) Mom and Ezra left me in her car while they went to get dinner from KFC. Her brake lights were on, which meant something about a bike. Daryl and someone came past on a bike and I had a bike so I followed them to this place. Elijah, Seamus and Dmitri were also there. I was hanging around for a while, when Ezra came with his burger. I hurried back to the car and Mom had eaten half of my burger."
"0587"	"(2006-05-18 (15)) I was at school and there was this 'boys' area. Calvin pushed me into it. Almost everyone had their shirts off and I was trying to get out and Elijah and Dmitri saw me.

"0588"	"(2006-05-19 (15)) I was at school and I got a heap of school clothes and my jumper. There were $2 coins. I put the clothes in a school bag and some in a plastic bag. I was then at a beach place. There was a tornado thing and it was going through the water and it was zig-zagging. I left the plastic bag behind but wouldn't take off my school bag which slowed me down considerably. We ran through a track. Where we were going had been destroyed. We ran back where we came from but it was collapsed in. Calvin, a girl, her brother (he looked and sounded like Chase from House) and I got trapped in this plastic tunnel thing. He liked me and kept making references to the fact. There was a tyre with a thing you blow into. It all melted later and we got out. I accidentally left my shoes. On the way back to get my shoes, Dmitri said that I sucked and kept being gay."
"0589"	"(2006-05-19 (15)) I accidentally opened my diary to a page that said ""I love Lumpy"". Calvin saw. He said he did and said ""I think you like Lumpy, but it's a guess""."

After struggling our way through the bush, we came to a clearing. This guy was in a car and he told us he'd kill us if we didn't hand over the burgers. Dad handed over four and I hid the rest. The guy ate two and got out of the car to do something. I ate my two burgers then gave Mom and Nana one each. The guy brought us to this place where he lived. There were caves and tents for houses. There were quite a few people there. They kept getting people and either eating or killing them or keeping them. The people I remember were Scott, who was the guy from the car, Dylan and David (who was in love with this girl that they had kept) and the girl that David liked. Scott ended up letting us go and Dylan, David and the girl as well. I wanted Scott to come (because he was hot) but I didn't say anything. We were then on a bus. David and the girl were cuddling and kissing. Dylan wanted to do the same thing with me and when I refused he talked to someone else. I was dressed in a costume. There was this doll in a dress and this little girl wanted to play with it. She said that she was ""five, not two"". There were older kids on the bus too. I saw The Graduate at a video shop. The end was actually people burning on a cross."
"0591"	"(2006-05-21 (15)) The gym at school was only for gay guys. Elijah needed to get changed. He was flicking the shutters on the side of the gym to see if they could see, then he was like ""Screw it"" and went to the toilet. I was watching Nickelodeon and there was something about five shows on one channel. Granny gave me chocolate. I was then at Nana's and Nana said that Big Brother was sexist."
"0592"	"(2006-05-23 (15)) The guys across the road were violent. They tried to get inside. I was yelling at them. They left. Later they jumped the fence and came in.

Mom said to find out what he something."
"0595"	"(2006-05-24 (15)) Ms Braun was shooting people. Seventeen of the bullets hit people who lived. It all kept restarting. I got hit, but it didn't hurt. Samantha got shot and Silas was crying. Then the next time, she shot everyone including a baby."

"0598"	"(2006-05-28 (15)) There was some show and people were in floats. Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus went past on a bus. The next day all these people were sick. This grass from this place had felt funny and tasted funny. We were then at school and this giant girl was walking around and she took funny steps. People were in costumes. There was this machine which did morphs of people. We were lining up and Calvin was in front of me. Daryl had his turn before mine. I still tried to go with him, but couldn't. Calvin got matched with Devin. We were hiding from some dude."
"0599"	"(2006-05-30 (15)) I got turned into an eye. I turned back into a person but I had a really good memory. Ezra and I had a fight. I was watching 'Big Brother' ad Kate was on it. There were comics at the house. Kate's ex boyfriend was on there."
"0600"	"(2006-05-30 (15)) I had a dream within the dream that I was making out with Daryl. Samantha, some ugly dude, some other people and I were on a Big Brother."
"0601"	"(2006-05-31 (15)) Samantha, Calvin, Silas and I were somewhere. Dad and Ezra were there too. I think we were outside of town. I was at this place like a Roman place and I was having a bath. I dropped a jumper in it. This guy was playing music and he said that it would be the ""last piece of music you'll hear for a year"". There was a sign-in book at this place and it had been signed by me already and I signed again. Silas was on a little cart and was driving it. It had controls which went the opposite way they were supposed to. He almost ran over this hedgehog and got in trouble so I drove instead. I was in front of him before though (you drove from the back). Then I was at an airport and Dad was AWOL and we couldn't get the ticket. Somehow we were then at the airport (or so I thought) and I saw Daryl and his brother Dewey. Samantha and Calvin found stuff that I'd written that said ""I love"" and had Simon Pegg, Ryan Cartwright and a lot more people's initials. They thought something also said Zander, though it said MP (Michael Palin), which I was thinking said AL. Samantha said I was a 'little' obsessed. Daryl and Dewey were talking about me. Daryl had a piercing so I decided I didn't like him anymore."
"0602"	"(2006-06-01 (15)) There was a planet that was part of Earth, but was separate or something. I wondered why I hadn't seen it before, because you could see it clearly and could almost jump onto it. There was some disease on it and there was no cure or vaccine except for this thing that you had to inject within four minutes of being infected. I somehow ended up on there and so did a few others. There was a professional tattoo guy and he was the cause of the problem. There was an alien frog thing which they wanted to breed with someone but there was no water. This boy was found in the shower. His name was Dmitri or something that sounded like it. I had to look after him."

"0605"	"(2006-06-03 (15)) I was at school and it was Year 11. My timetable sucked. I had no S+E until next semester, but I had cooking first though it turned out that cooking meant Phys. Ed. This meant seven periods of Phys. Ed. a week. I refused to go and requested that it be changed. At some place someone was using a car or a bus as a plane."
"0606"	"(2006-06-03 (15)) I was at some place and Dmitri was going out with Brianna, but she cheated on him with Carson who she'd gone out with before. Almost everyone knew, but a teacher asked Dmitri about it and Dmitri got upset but soon recovered. I was standing around later with Dmitri and I saw Daryl over somewhere and I was thinking to myself whether I liked Dmitri or Daryl more. Calvin also turned into a bird and he was in a shop with watches."

"0609"	"(2006-06-04 (15)) I was reading a book and there was a part where this big lady changed her name to Izzy Conell. This torch was dim and then it wasn't. Dad picked me up from Mom's."

There were animals and everyone was swerving for monkeys. She said it was the Desert and I was saying it didn't look like a desert. Her oldest child was called Jennifer, her second was called Scott, and her youngest who was also a girl was called Cheddar. Some guy was in a purple thing. His name was James and God called him Michael. It was then a different time, and he was a philosopher. Someone 'popped' him and he said he would smash everything so we undid it."
"0611"	"(2006-06-09 (15)) I was at this house which had pools. Daryl and I were swimming and I was skinny. I ran out of clothes. I went to the toilet and they had cameras in there. Duane was outside the door. Calvin, Samantha and I were sleeping in a car."
"0612"	"(2006-06-09 (15)) We were somewhere inside sitting on chairs. Calvin was sitting next to Elijah and Dmitri was on his other side.

"0617"	"(2006-06-11 (15)) I was at this place and everyone from school was there. There was a ghost. Everyone was told to get in the pool because someone was going to kill me.

Eugene and Seamus were fighting over a piece of paper which was something of Eugene's. It fell into the air and Eugene ran to Seamus so I grabbed it and it was photos of this actress called Mel something and reasons why he liked her. He started wrestling me for it. I had Media but I accidentally went to S+E. Dmitri said that he the best looking in his group at the time. His music video was for Only Sixteen, which was also what we were doing."
"0622"	"(2006-06-18 (15)) This girl and I were at home. People from House of 1000 Corpses were coming to take us. She wandered off and I saw her getting taken into Ezra's bookcase.

They came over and his parents came back out and were looking snobby and saying stuff about the house and Ezra and I were mocking them. Melanie went with them. Dmitri and I ended up in some room and were throwing pillows at each other. We kept turning into things and he kept turning into this hell thing which I didn't like. I turned into this strange gopher thing. Later I was at this school and I was standing around lockers. Dmitri came up to me and was looking nervous.

It was Granny's old house, but didn't look like it. I didn't trust the person so I snuck into the kitchen and unlocked the door and started running but my knee screwed up and they got me. We ended up escaping. I was on this plane and there were people from Year 7 and Year 6. I was looking out the window to see Dmitri. I put all these blankets and stuff on top of me. Calvin was there. This guy told him that he had had dreams of me and he recognized me (he was the same guy from before, but not). When we got off he ran upstairs and he realized who I was."

Calvin came over and he called Dmitri over and some others. A girl there was talking about someone called Eugene and she said to me ""Not Eugene Pritchard"" and I said ""I don't care"" They asked me if I would go on a team for my ""boyfriend"" etc."
"0739"	"(2006-09-07 (15)) I was at a house and there was a guy who looked like Judd Nelson. He took off in his car and we went to go into his house. Calvin and Ezra went in? I didn't. There were strange noises coming from Dad's room and Samantha was at home."
"0740"	"(2006-09-07 (15)) I was digging up TV shows in front yard. This guy wanted some movies and I said I'd just give him DVD's. There was this place for movies. This guy was asking questions. I was at the shop and Ivan was there and he was calling me 'Fatty'. There weren't any taps at the shop and someone went spazzy. Quincy gave me this lunch box starter pack as a present."
"0741"	"(2006-09-08 (15)) I was at Granny's old house. Dmitri was there, but I don't know why. We were having a laugh. He was sitting on Granny's chair. I was on the one near the bookshelf. We were talking about school. Ezra said he reckoned he liked me. Dmitri was holding hands with Mackenzie somewhere."
"0742"	"(2006-09-08 (15)) Calvin grew into an 'adult', like how they do in Sims 2. He was really hot."

"0746"	"(2006-09-09 (15)) I was at school. We were given these rings that we had to keep with us at all times. We were making these boxes to keep them in to hang around our necks. We were in my English classroom. Mine went missing. Adele was there. Evelyn was sitting next to me. I went back to my desk as Dmitri was going to put something in his black file in this cupboard behind me. But because I was in the way, he gave the stuff to me to put away. I started reading through his file thing, and I was going to take some of his stuff, but Evelyn was watching me. There was a book where he had done those gay games with Calvin and there was something about ""Swamp Boy"". His interests (supposedly last 'searched' items) were piercings, eyebrows and I forgot the rest, there were lots though. I only remembered the bad things. I was terribly upset about this and decided I couldn't like him anymore. At lunchtime Ezra and his friends were annoying us. Calvin and I were throwing sticks at them. I think Elijah was there too."
"0747"	"(2006-09-10 (15)) I was in this cage thing. I forget what happened before, but anyway, Daryl and I were going out or something and we were both in this cage thing. Darth Vader sent us out and was fighting us. Darth was on the roof. He showed us a big building thing. I couldn't fight back, so he was teaching me how to use the force. At home, out the back, Anakin was chucking a spaz about Darth Vader [this doesn't make sense, but there you go] . He had a rocket."
"0748"	"(2006-09-10 (15)) I was out the back and this guy dug up this thing (except the guy was me). I was wearing a giant fleur de lis on my head. Dad took it off and my head felt weird."

"0760"	"(2006-09-15 (15)) I was at some weird place. These people decided they had to kill Calvin off and they shot him in the back of the head. But he didn't die and he ran away. There was no water around as it was rare. But, there were these (what I called) 'tribunals' to pump water from some place (which I thought I had taken from Kin-Dza-Dza). Ms Quintana gave me drops for my nose/eye. The liquid from the drops goes down your throat. I went to find Calvin. I was outside some shops and I ran away from people. There was this trail somewhere and I found Elijah, Seamus, Dmitri and Daryl. Someone had a fight."

"0768"	"(2006-09-21 (15)) I had S+E and Ms Corbett wanted us to stay in the library during lunch. I had to collect paper and I had to keep going through the library. Calvin came. The library was different. Pieces of paper from my dream book and stuff were falling out. Someone asked me something about going out with Payton. I was like 'What the hell?!'. I went over there. Payton and this girl had found a dream of me going out with Payton. I tried to explain. Ezra, Nicolas and some others took off with my bag. So I went to the Year 8 block. The playground was knocked over. I asked lady about the Year 8 block and then I saw black smoke, so I ran to Yr 8 block. I jumped on this thing and finally got to end (there were lots of jumps and stuff). Samantha was in this box thing at the end. She started eating this thing and others came and they were all eating and I realized eating meant death. So I survived."

I wanted to see the one at a place called Sealord, because it was the only one with Ted in it, but it was really far away. The movie ended with him and this girl having an argument."
"0772"	"(2006-09-24 (15)) We went out and when we came back home the door was unlocked. The TV was still there, so we figured we hadn't been broken into. I only remember Dad."

The next-door neighbour let me go to their place and we were all complaining about Dad's girlfriend. Ezra was there and we were all going to sleepover there. I was thinking about missing school. I was thinking about Calvin for some reason."
"0795"	"(2006-10-03 (15)) I was at school, which was different, and I was in Year 11. I had art first in Room D9. I had to go in through a hidden door and down these steps. There was a carousel. My teacher was Debbie (Queer as Folk US) I then had S+E. I was late there. There were people I didn't like in the class. Everyone was spread out. The desks were in levels. Dmitri came late too. I then had art again but Calvin was in my class so I asked the teacher, who was different, if I could change classes. I had to go to the front office to see some Henry guy who was actually Hugh Grant (because, as I put it, it was an all-star cast). On the way there I was debating which class I should go to."

"0797"	"(2006-10-04 (15)) I was at 'school' and there were these dinosaurs there. They did different things according to their moods -- it was a game. Calvin, Samantha and I were together. If the dinosaurs got angry we had to hide in 'nooks' that were randomly placed. We were in a computer room. Samantha hid behind a curtain, which was behind some of the nooks. One of the dinosaurs came running in and I told it that a young dinosaur had gone past. It went out of the room to look, but Calvin said that it kept staring into this room. We went to the next room, which was full of computers too. We needed C4 for something and we also had to draw a picture of a guy that would be described by Mr Ripley. I decided to put my newly found drawing skills to work. I had to draw this guy within 15 minutes."
"0798"	"(2006-10-04 (15)) I was watching Cast Away except it was Gladiator, except it wasn't. Dad was in it, and I was sure that I was also in it, but everyone said that I wasn't. Then I was there. There was a king and he was sick of his fat wife and was looking for a new one. I encouraged this poor friend of mine to 'apply'. The king was getting her to read something, but she couldn't read. I was helping her and saying that reading was easy (I was from now, but they were from the past and most people couldn't read). The king ended up putting me down on his list and choosing me because I could read. There was an attack. I was hiding behind this gate and a dinosaur came up and took some guy in his mouth and I said ""George!"" and the dinosaur said in a creepy raspy voice ""George?"" and let him go. All the people in the village or whatever it was surrendered. All the important people were giving themselves up. I managed to sneak away. There were road signs in the village. Some guy said that the village was fake (like in The Village)."

I put my pages over there and Dmitri said ""When was the last time you were over here?"" We were discussing Pokemon from the book. I remember we were talking about Steelix and this other thing that Dmitri said looked like ""Aqua girl"". I said ""I've never heard of it, what's it from?"" He started laughing and said that he had made it up and I was like 'What the hell? That's not funny'."
"0801"	"(2006-10-05 (15)) I had sport and Silas was there. I thought that I was in his class, but I wasn't. He was standing around though. I heard a girl saying ""If you weren't a knowledge Sim, what would you do?"" I remembered I had written that in my fat little notebook. She had read it. I looked in the book at that page and I had written stuff about Dmitri. Rebekah and Alyssa had a fight with me. They took my shoes. I went to sleep in Nana's room and they were going to cut my hair. They had big scissors. Nana woke me up and we both yelled at them. Ezra was there too."
"0802"	"(2006-10-05 (15)) I was on a bus. I was waiting for Calvin. There was an adult shop nearby. He had a puzzle book from there and had to take it back.

"0807"	"(2006-10-07 (15)) Mom dropped me off at home, which was actually Dad's 'work'. He had started his own bottle shop. I had forgotten my keys. Ezra was in the car too. Darren took me back later and I forgot my keys again. Dad was there this time though and he said to turn the lights off when the shop closed because he was going out. The customers were getting angry. People from school were there. Then it was closed, so I quickly got rid of all the customers."
"0808"	"(2006-10-08 (15)) I was reading about Robert Gant. He had died the 29/9/06 due to AIDS. I was thinking it was weird because that day was the first day that I started watching Queer as Folk (US). [It's not really, I actually first watched it on the 22/9/06.]"
"0809"	"(2006-10-08 (15)) I was at this weird place and Aunt Sally was living there, underground. Ezra was wearing a nappy and was chucking a spaz. People from Queer as Folk (US) were there. Scott Lowell and I ended up going out (only after a few minutes). Johnny Depp was there also. There was a premiere thing. He was flirting with me and there was this bouncy flower thing and there were pipes. Something turned into a mushroom. Scott and I left and we went to McDonald's. I wanted a chicken Caesar and because it was late and busy we had to wait. They let us wait in this special part of the drive thru, which actually was inside the store. Ezra and Dad pulled up behind us and I said hello. Then I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Dad got a CD off a girl who was in some advertisement. We were going to watch it on the laptop."

"0813"	"(2006-10-12 (15)) I was with Scott Lowell somewhere and he was fat. It was only because he had an ice pack under his jumper and it was big and squishy. I was telling him how 'cute' he looked. Then I took the ice pack off him and put it under my shirt and I looked pregnant."
"0814"	"(2006-10-12 (15)) We drove past where the evil Brookland shops should be and it had been turned into an evil carnival place. I didn't even realize where it was until we drove past."

"0817"	"(2006-10-13 (15)) I was at Mom's. The people next door were being shifty. I was listening to my iPod, outside sitting on the edge of the front yard, with my feet hanging over some bricks. I also had my Mp3 player, two bits of paper and two water bottles. Cuddles took my Mp3 player. A lady from next door came over and took all my stuff except for my iPod, which I refused to give up. I kept kicking her in the face. She said that she would take my iPod by Friday (it was Tuesday or something). I told Mom, but she didn't care. I was then at home, except it was Darren and Mom's place. I heard a noise and some singing and went into Dad's room and woke Darren. I told him that the people were here. I peeked out and Mom came out of the toilet. I asked if it was her that had been singing. She said no and then the bad guys appeared. I went back to my room and closed my door. They barged in. There were four guys and one girl (I think). One of the guys's decided that he didn't want to do this and he tried to push two of the guys out of the room. He couldn't and they set him on fire. I managed to run into Dad's room. While running, I tripped over this blonde guy who didn't try to stop me and I got a wine bottle and something else. I killed two of the guys. I was hitting the blonde guy a bit. An ambulance came for the burnt guy."

This Gale guy was a 'tough guy' and kept trying to go out with me. Eric was always around to distract him though. I liked Eric, and I knew that he liked me. Everything was covered in snow. I was walking near Gale's house and I was walking down these steps. Gale came down and started advancing towards me. Eric had this bomb thing, and it was counting down. It got down to 10 seconds and Gale decided that he was going to kiss me (he had me pressed up against a wall). So I grabbed Eric and started making out with him. He threw the bomb and it did something to Gale's legs. I had kissed Eric because I figured that the kiss from Gale was inevitable and so I wanted my first kiss to be with someone that I loved."

He thought that one bag was mine and I said ""What the hell, that's Seamus's!"" Evelyn and Elana were standing near a truck. Calvin and Samantha were doing some storyboard thing. Dad and Ezra were waiting in the car. I went to the toilet."

Dad showed me and it was one we'd been to before (in the dream). There was a library in there. I wanted to get a book out but you had to fill out an application. I was yelling at Dad for buying it. Ezra was walking down the street, and we were in a car. He was behind us and was going to get in the car with some shifty dudes. He took a guitar off them and I was calling for him not to get in the car with them, but I don't think he could hear me."
"0933"	"(2006-11-28 (15)) I was at home and there were zombies. Samantha, Calvin and Ezra were also there. Most of the windows had curtains over them. Ezra was watching TV. We were telling him to keep it down. There was a flashback of this little midget/leprechaun dude. He had snuck out of the house. I was in the laundry wondering about Dmitri. I heard a moan and I quickly ran to the family room with Calvin. He lay down on the floor and Samantha went out the back and then came back in. I tried to lock the back door but was having trouble. The zombies went to the back fridge and were hugging it. There was a newspaper and it said something about someone who had been learning to drive and the passenger had been killed. Then there were zombies at a school. There was a fridge. Someone died, who I think was Elijah, and we had the body still. Someone had gotten pregnant to a zombie."

But she wasn't allowed out on Tuesdays due to some 'Passover' thing."

This old guy asked if I wanted to go in his shower and I was like ""Hell no!"". Then it turned into a game and I went with him. He was actually a nun, but he got pregnant with a boy, who I think was Zander. There was also a girl whose name I can't remember, but it started with an 'M'. She had to find out what 'my' husband was. There was a video that came on of him doing some experiment with me. I don't know."
"0940"	"(2006-12-02 (15)) The school went to this shop place to get tested for HIV. Dmitri wasn't there. It was my turn and the lady put the stuff on my veins and then I decided not to do it. There were Goosebumps books there. I was trying to call Mom to ask for them and she had bought me some earlier. Evelyn got tested. I said I didn't have to because I didn't have HIV because ""I've never had sex!"" and also because I was scared of needles."
"0941"	"(2006-12-02 (15)) I was at school and Ms Corbett gave me a job. Evelyn was trying to get into this shirt. I was running on the oval and I started to float in the air. I was watching some movie."

"0950"	"(2006-12-07 (15)) I was at 'school'. Calvin and I were answering questions about Samantha. Evelyn was in a wheelchair. Calvin wrote that Samantha was born in September. We went on IMDb and two other sites to help. There was something about Tiana and some Paul person. She had this thing and they were going to get $100. Tiana didn't believe that I knew Dmitri. She confronted him and he said that he knew me. He walked into the girls toilets."

I was trying to find out about Classmate-M-24. I went into this room, which had a desk and 'waiting' chairs. I saw this kid who looked like him. I asked if his last name was Ellis and he said yes. Then I asked him if her father was called Classmate-M-24 and he said yes. Classmate-M-24 then came out and took him and I called out ""Who's your mother?!"" and he said Dorothy, which was a name that I had found earlier when looking for information."
"0952"	"(2006-12-14 (15)) I was at a hospital and I worked there. George and Izzie (both Grey's Anatomy) were there.

There were three movies playing and one was Sample People, but it was completely different. Someone was talking about ""dreamy Nathan Page"". I recognized Sample People playing and I saw Nathan Page there and I said ""I love that movie! I watched it for Ben Mendelsohn, but it ended up being my favourite movie, you were really good"". Poppa was there."
"0953"	"(2006-12-14 (15)) I was at this big house and there was a werewolf. I ran into this room with Samantha and I had a plastic bag with me and it made a noise. There were little kids in the room. Elijah came to the door and the werewolf was behind him, but the werewolf only wanted me. I ran outside onto a balcony. I opened the door once I was outside so that it would open to a little girl. The wolf came and I closed it. Then I was naked. There was a place where people fix cars (and there were lots of cars). Samantha and I took a shirt from them. Then there was a clothes montage.

"0959"	"(2006-12-16 (15)) I was at school and it was Year 11. Calvin and I were late for class. The teacher was called Ms Cole. The floor was noisy. I 'ran' to a chair and the teacher yelled at me for being rude. I ended up sitting on the floor. I realized it was woodwork. Calvin and I went next door to accounting. Calvin got a letter from Ms Cole to let him do accounting instead. I needed to ask her, but I thought she was going to say no, but she let me. I had three pairs of shoes. In accounting I had to sit next to Harlan. Samantha poked her tongue out at me. There were lots of people in the class. Later, we were watching something and I asked Samantha if she watched Heroes. She said ""Yeah, I just love Peter and want to take him home!"" and I started laughing thinking, 'Yeah, so do I'. There was a guy in some thing. People were getting killed and swapping."

People had to throw in one thing of theirs. I had written an introduction and stuff about Terrence was in it. Someone had crossed out my name and had put Kyle. I accidentally got rid of it all and rewrote it."

I got it outside (we were in a room) but it could get back in, so I ran off. I ran down to Nana's house. The outside was different. Daryl was standing in a path. I was locking the doors and I told him about the horse and he suggested I go up to Granny's place. I ran up there. Poppers and Uncle Wilbur were there too."
"0970"	"(2006-12-21 (15)) Nana picked me and Ezra up from school. Poppa was driving. We were going to their house because of a dead cat.

"1013"	"(2007-01-18 (15)) Alex Karev (Grey's Anatomy) had had surgery and had found something that had been left inside him."
"1014"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) Mom made me a ham and baked bean toasted sandwich."
"1015"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) Devil's Rejects was on, but it was halfway through. Otis was there. The grandpa was trying to get a job at a bar. There were pictures on the wall and one was a picture of an eye, with teeth in it. Dad said not to watch it now."
"1016"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) Samantha was jumping over puddles."
"1017"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) I was at school and was complaining about it. Evelyn and Calvin were there. I ate lunch at home. This teacher gave me Goosebumps books. In English we were reading a story about a dog. People kept taking Ezra out for a drink."
"1018"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) I was running and hiding from these bad guys. There was a pregnant girl. I had to jump over this fence."
"1019"	"(2007-01-19 (15)) I was at school and Cedric was there. I was confused that he was there and forgot his name for a second."
"1020"	"(2007-01-20 (15)) Rottnest was having problems. It was actually a manmade island and kept sinking. I went to some Timezone place with some guys. I liked this guy called Shane, but then I liked this guy called Steve. Later, Ezra was on the island when it started sinking.  There were two Spaceman's. Ezra left on a boat and he thought that he'd thrown one off."
"1021"	"(2007-01-20 (15)) Mom and Darren were in this mine, as was I. My pants got worms in them."
"1022"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) We were friendly with these aliens. One of them was called Jenny Broomer (which was just spelt with Greek symbol). She was actually Callie and was with George (both from Grey's Anatomy). She had to eat cockroaches before she'd be with him. She was in our spa. I didn't like her but was trying to be friendly and gave her lollies. I went out there at one point and she was gone."
"1023"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) Mom and I were in a car. This girl friend of mine came up and asked Mom for help but Mom said no, so she asked me. I accepted telling her that I'm no good for advice. She led me to this car and underneath was a 'vagina'. It was actually just a pile of intestines and there was blood everywhere. There was some red thing rammed into the middle of it and I took it out. I was thinking about Ted Bundy."
"1024"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) I was at school and I had to go do this thing with beds, like move them around and stuff. Anyway, afterwards I found the bench and Calvin was there with Evelyn."
"1025"	"(2007-01-21 (15)) Ted Bundy and I were hanging out. He had done something bad and we were running from the police. He had 'powers' and could stop time and rewind it, among other things. We were driving fast in this car and it went airborne over this gap and landed on this mountain sort of thing, with a road on it. There was a goat in the car. He drove on this wobbly road really fast and I was worried we would go over the edge. We ended up in Washington DC. The house thing was near a fair and a restaurant. This lady and her kids were at the fair and I said something to the kid and the mother chucked a spaz. Ted paused or did something weird to the time and I bashed her. She said that I'd said ""Sod off"". He rewound time and we left. Johnny Depp was in the restaurant and Ted said ""Now he's eating"" and then Johnny looked at us for a second and then left. I was sitting at a table and some girl asked if I wanted to go to some back room. I said no, but Ted went. I left the table and saw Johnny Knoxville coming out of a cinema. I asked him for a photo and he said ""It's not important"" and went to rest somewhere. He was going to the back room, so I went in there first. It was all seats, like a cinema. It was dark and I was trying to find Ted. Then all these people started to pretend that they were who I was looking for. Ted made them turn the lights back on and I found him and we left. As we were walking out through some door, I had my arm around him and I realized and quickly took it back."
"1026"	"(2007-01-22 (15)) Ezra was watching some movie with Gene Kelly, which was Hello Dolly, but it was actually called 'Dolly Wife'. I thought it was strange that he was watching it."
"1027"	"(2007-01-22 (15)) I was at home. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were there fixing these cars and the electricity. Dad was talking to them. I was trying to have a shower and was checking the taps, but then Ezra wanted to have a shower."
"1028"	"(2007-01-22 (15)) There was this blob robot thing. It broke out of its container. I was in the games room with Mom. I said ""My name is Izzy, your name is Blobby. What's your name?"". It just stood still and 'stared' blankly ahead."
"1029"	"(2007-01-23 (15)) Ezra and I were going to go to the movies with Dad. We ended up at a zoo near a friend of Mom's. We were actually close to the cinema. Her friend looked like Mr Willingham. He was really rich and had a HUGE pool. I came back there some other time and Charlene was there on a swinging chair. I sat next to her and she said that she wanted his stuff (he was going to sell it and was probably going to give some money to me). He came along and pushed the chair away from the edge of the pool, which had no water in it, and was full of his stuff. Some guy at this new house wanted his books. Some of them were called Idiot, George and Stumpy. The Idiot one fell out but pushed Charlene into the pool."
"1030"	"(2007-01-23 (15)) I was at school. We had a gay seating plan. I was then in this shop and Dmitri was following me around in a wheelchair. I ended up at an aisle with PC games, and then he left."
