"B-001"	"#B-001 (2001-06-10 (16)) This is the first time in a long time that I've actually been able to wake up and remember the dream that I had. They've been slipping away from me as soon as I gain consciousness for some reason. But the other night I had a dream that I was at this run-down house -- kind of like Aunt Kristin's house -- and we heard this band playing. And Christina and I were walking around, and we were going to try to record this thing, and it was playing in one of those portable classroom-like things. And we were walking around to get the best vantage point because she wanted to record it. And we even stepped inside and realized that it was much quieter in there, because their amplifier was, they had the wires like under the door and everything outside so that we could hear them. And it looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner, only without the hose. [laugh] And then I was listening to a tape that was supposed to have some oldies on it, but instead it had some bluebird songs and some oldies. And I dreamt that Christina and I -- it was dark by then -- we were walking and she gave me three numbers. One was 898-2956, the usual one. The other one was one that she had gotten for her birthday, but she got it taken away because she violated her curfew. And then the third one was another one that she got."
"B-002"	"#B-002 (2001-06-10 (16)) The other night's dream, the one I just said, had a bunch of silver things in it: a silver unit to play the tapes on, a silver recorder that Christina was going to record the band, and the band's amplifier was silver. It looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner without the hose. And last night's dream was full of red things. I don't remember, I have no recollection as to what happened, but I remember walking in a red house and seeing red things, and having a little toy house that was red."
"B-003"	"#B-003 (2001-06-12 (16)) This is the morning after. I have to record this dream before it slips away. It is now firmly implanted in my head. First I dreamt that Josie and Marilyn and Dad and I were staying in a hotel, and I confronted Dad about canceling the Buxton House in the spring, and he actually felt bad about it. And he took us to this -- right when I confronted him, he was wearing this robe like judges wear -- and then we went to this park called Cumidy (sp?) Inn Park. And it was out towards Miramonte, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Miramonte. And when we got there, we didn't have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn't terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam -- I swam right behind Dad, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him [laugh] , and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn't swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer [laugh] . How can you mix without a mixer? But anyway, after that I was just glad I could get down out of there, and Mom was saying she had to clean that pool area pretty soon. And then I woke up."
"B-004"	"#B-004 (2001-06-13 (16)) I was in my room listening to my sound system, scanning the airwaves and trying to look for a song to record. And I must have been in there for an hour in the dream, and Dad comes in and says, ""Time to shut it off now."" And he clothes it in a weird meaning. He says that the CD burner is a p__peeing??_ unit because it's going and recording in the same way that we go pee. I woke up at 1:30 in the morning and I was kind of scared, but I had to go pee. Maybe that's why I dreamt that."
"B-005"	"#B-005 (2001-06-13 (16)) Mom had brought me a Beauty and the Beast doll that sang the way Ariel (sp?) does. And I was, before I opened the box I was wondering where could the audio module be, because in Ariel it's in her fin. And when I opened the box, I saw that she was just like a regular Barbie Doll on top, but she had, she had like a thing without a tail. She had no legs. And apparently that was the sound thing for her. And then, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park. Anyway, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park, and she was singing louder than anything without a microphone.. This pen is driving me insane. She was singing as loud as she could without an amplifier, and it was just like that she had one. And then I walked in to her hotel room and I saw her and her kids kind of peeking around in there. And I got to see the outfit that she was going to wear to the concert, and I got to talk to her, and her voice was quiet, just like Sandra's voice. Anyway, I dreamt that me and Melinda's family ran into her family and just talked. And then I woke up."
"B-006"	"#B-006 (2001-06-14 (16)) We were all this party, and Dad and Mom and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their 40s, and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn't even sing to. The real song goes, ""Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!"" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, ""Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done."" I can't explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Six Flags or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn't because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn't go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn't even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn't have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody's key is - oh, what's the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, ""I have never noticed that,"" and she said, ""That's because you're never sick."""
"B-007"	"#B-007 (2001-06-17 (16)) Dad wanted to put together a CD for Grandpa and he went to Specs and he got these CD's. And we were standing on balcony at the mall and he knocked them over the banister and they all went falling and crashing down to the first floor. And, I don't know, all of a sudden they had this CD writer on a picnic table, and he said that he went back and he got another one, and he was saying that this nun named Angelina wrapped the CD's. And then I was, he had to take the sound equipment and put it in a box for some reason, and then he gave me the box and told me that I had to put it all back together. And I took the equipment out and set it back on my desk like it goes, and I was started to put the wires back in and they were all going in pretty good, and then the wires for the speakers on the west wall weren't going in so good and I needed help putting them in. And Dad was on the phone, so I needed help putting them in. And I woke up before the wires could be connected again."
"B-008"	"#B-008 (2001-06-18 (16)) A few nights ago I had a dream that my sound system upstairs belonged to the school system, and that sometimes I would see some maintenance guy in a suit and tie come over and put the receiver and the CD writer on a cart and wheel it into my closet. And he said that that was going to be storing it until next year. And as soon as he left, I would take it out and put it back on the desk. And I had to return a book to Mrs. Talmadge, but I was too afraid to go up to her, and I don't think I ever returned it before I woke up. Last night I had a very peculiar dream. First of all I dreamt that we were near a sea wall at the waterfront, and everybody wanted me to scuba dive. They said that if I wanted to stay down there for three weeks, I was going to need scuba gear [laugh] . And also I dreamt that Tweety was this paper Styrofoam bird with paper wings and a napkin folded and all for her tail. And she was really a listening device so that I could monitor what people were saying on the phone. And there was also these two other birds, Archie, my cockatiel and then there was this white bird -- very delicate with a plume -- and wings that were raised up. And then both of those birds were kind of in cahoots with the Styrofoam Tweety somehow, and the wings of the other white bird also stayed up for some reason. Then I also dreamt that I was sitting on the steps with my feet towards the up of the steps, and I was trying to get the mini-cassette to work, and the terminals were like way loose, and it wasn't really cooperating. There was this big cardboard box ____??_______. And then Dad comes up the steps. Anyway, this tape is really squeaky now. And then Dad comes up the stairs and says that it's my problem. And then I woke up."
"B-009"	"#B-009 (2001-06-26 (16)) I was back at Bancroft Middle School, kind of, and I was in a stairwell, and there must've been ten alarm boxes all on the same wall. And some administrator was saying that when the alarm goes off, these doors locked, and then you were stuck in there for the next half an hour. People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they'd lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass. And I dreamt that a police officer came and put me in handcuffs and then I woke up. Never experienced this for real, not sure why I'd dream it. The next one I don't even remember."
"B-010"	"#B-010 (2001-06-26 (16)) I was already in Spain and that we were staying at this place, this lady was big and fat, and she spoke more English than she did Spanish. And she had a husband and three sons and we were all swimming in a pool, and then we got out and I remember that her house was kind of dark and that, hmm, let's see. We were walking around these gardens and things and it was all supposedly a city of Salamanca, but there were no real buildings besides her house. And hmmm, I don't remember anything else now, but I remember that I was so shocked that this big, fat woman could hardly speak any Spanish and she lived in Spain. "
"B-011"	"#B-011 (2001-07-01 (16)) Mom and I wanted to take a walk, and we were going to bring the personal CD player along with the hand-held portable radio in order to listen to what the boats were doing out in the water. We were going to walk down to the waterfront. And we started walking and I got lost, and I just sat down and listened to the personal CD player. But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody's Fox 13 truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn't a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker. The sound was really thin and flat, though, but for some reason we were all fascinated by it. The next thing I know, we were walking In the park with this thing clipped to my belt."
"B-012"	"#B-012 (2001-07-28 (16)) I was still in Spain, and that we were still in the apartment thing. And the apartment thing was really much blander than the one that we had, although you can't get much blander than that. The girls came and went without me, as usual. Anyway, we were talking about going to this little school at night, and afterwards going to this theme park. And then we were at the school and Aretha Franklin and this other lady named Elizabeth were going to show us how to cook something, and then they started showing us how to cook it. And everybody was like zoning off and wanting to go to sleep and wanting to not pay attention, but then I remember going on a roller coaster that everybody was talking about, and you held onto some orange handles. And you would go down for a long ways and you'd go upside down and around and all over. And we never did get to the theme park. I woke up first. "
"B-013"	"#B-013 (2001-08-01 (16)) Our receiver wasn't working and that Dad got all upset and mad and decided that he didn't want anything to do with it. And so Mom and I were going to fix it by ourselves, and we started working on it, and we got the front left-to-right channels to work just fine, but no matter what we did, we could not get the surround sounds to work and we had a movie on pause while we were doing all this. And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main buildings looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Richards and Ms. Salazar, and we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody's classroom. And then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Kendra that was sitting at the sound board and her and I were talking. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things, and that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends. And I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes. And I would get all nervous and jerky when I would see one. Continued on Side 2. "
"B-014"	"#B-014 (2001-08-04 (16)) I was going to have to go to Southwest High School this coming school year. I dreamt that I had Tweety on my shoulder while I was walking around this hallway with white floors, and that we were going to have to go to the Guidance Counselor's office to get my schedule, but the Guidance Office wouldn't be open for the next three days until the coming Monday, which would mean that I would have to wander around until the office was open. Everybody else was wandering too, and these boys really liked Tweety and all of a sudden she turned into a gray pigeon. And then I woke up."
"B-015"	"#B-015 (2001-08-07 (16)) The Spanish group and I were staying at this strange hotel, and it had many, many, many rooms. And we were in this one room that was like a gift shop display room. And there was this fake wedding cake to feel that was supposedly Celine Dion and Rene Angelil's, and supposedly there was a painting of Celine and Rene doing it on the wall, and the girls wanted to go somewhere else. This room was really neat. So I walked out with them and I walked around, and we got on this elevator that was absolutely bizarre, and the elevator would like go sideways for a long ways, and then slowly get down to a floor or two and then go sideways some more, and then get down a floor or two, and then go sideways some more. And so on and so forth. And then we got off and I was walking around again. Anyway, I was walking around with them, and I was ___?____ to go back to the room with them, but instead of going back to the hotel room, I went to the room with the wedding cake and stuff and was touching the pretend wedding cake. And then I seem to recall some man entering, and I remember walking around with this man for a while there, but then I don't remember who he was or where he came from. I woke up."
"B-016"	"#B-016 (2001-08-08 (16)) I was back in Spain and that I was with Kendra, Theresa, Hannah and Norah. And I had bought a suit case for somebody over there, probably myself, but I don't remember. And I was rolling it around on the cart and Kendra, Norah and Theresa were helping me roll it. And we were staying in this theater place, and everybody else was in a family-type place, and I was with Kendra and she was helping me roll this thing around. And I had to cross this main___? To get outside _____?_____, and [laugh] this dumb tape. Anyway, _____ found these steep stairs and she picked up the whole cart and was carrying it down, and it got steeper and steeper as we went down, and all of a sudden it turned into a swimming pool instead of a stage area and we were trying to cross with this cart thing. And the girls were, I sat down on the side because I couldn't go any further, and I said, ""Could you please help me?"" and finally somebody came. And there was this Spanish guy and he swam me across. And finally we got out of the water and we were walking beside the pool; it was dark time. And they were still rolling the cart for me. We were going for the bus, and I told Mrs. Hollander about the incident, and she said, ""I knew something was going to go wrong. I just knew it."" Just the way she is. And then I woke up."
"B-017"	"#B-017 (2001-08-10 (16)) Dad and I had been staying somewhere, and living somewhere, and I somehow had the notion that it was Spain, but I didn't know for sure. I had just gotten back, and it was a week or so into school, and I was coming in, and I was walking back in the aisles in Mrs. Hollander's class, and it was real crowded, and the desks were yellow. And everyone was filled, and I got the one in the last of the back row. And Dad was telling Mrs. Hollander about what a hard time he was having teaching Spanish, and this one desk in the very back was yellow, but it was like mounted onto a table with the old Optilec (magnifying machine) on top of it. And I thought, ""How weird."" And Mrs. Hollander was going to start a lesson and I then I woke up."
"B-018"	"#B-018 (2001-08-12 (16)) Dad wanted to move his fire truck and hitch something up to it. So I crawled under it and it was like a trampoline thing, and when I went in it, it was kind of low to the ground, and I wondered how am I going to get out of here. But when I realized what they were going to do, I was scared, and I thought to myself, ""I've got to get out of here somehow."" And then I asked Dad, who was up above, I asked, ""Can I walk and down the walk while you guys do this?"" And he said, ""Sure."" So I wormed and squirmed my way out from under the truck. There was just enough room for me to squirm out from under it. And I realized that they were going to start up the engine and back it up a little bit, and then move it forward, so the result would be I would hear the back-up alarm and then hear the siren. So I figured I would walk as far away as I could and then be far way when that happened. So I took my bag -- I don't remember what I had in it at this time, but it will come to me, I'm sure. I took my bag and I went walking, and I walked, actually then I realized that the truck was parked in front of our house and I walked all the way up to 8th Street. And then I turned down 8th Street and went to 23rd Avenue and like went around a few blocks, and then I came back and they hadn't done it yet. And then I figured, ""I gotta get out of here somehow."" So I started crawling over all these boxes that suddenly appeared, and I started crawling faster and faster and faster as Dad started -- I couldn't see him, but somehow I know that he was getting in the driver's seat and getting ready to start it up. And I crawled faster and faster and faster, and all of a sudden it started becoming dark and I faded into consciousness. One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went ""drive, park, reverse"" and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn't the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn't have any of that on the side. In real life it was just hunky dory, but it had bad sound."
"B-019"	"#B-019 (2001-08-14 (16)) Okay, I had a dream that I was at this place, I was with this group. I must have still been in Spain because we were speaking Spanish sometimes. I'm kind of stuck on that. [laugh] And we were going to see somebody ice skating or rollerblading or doing some kind of tricks like that. And we were on rollerblades ourselves, and we were hurrying up to this place. And then we jumped on these escalators that go twice as fast as regular ones do. And so then they started, we like jumped on these escalators and they go really fast up, and then we arrived at the top and there was this ramp. And I couldn't stop my, I sat down on the edge of the ramp and I couldn't stop my feet from rolling down into the ramp. They were like hanging off into the middle of the floor there. And then I think I had another dream. I think we were there too early so we couldn't see the show then. Then I had another dream that I was at dinner and we were eating, eating, eating these things. I had just finished a course, and already this Spanish guy was serving me these things. He had a tray with like six compartments and he had to take these two spoonfuls ... [tape not working] . This is a horrible tape! "
"B-020"	"#B-020 (2001-08-16 (16)) I was at school already, that I was in homeroom and we had to fill out these forms which they called ""desk-writing forms"" that told your GPA last year and some information about yourself, and that they were going to grade us on that. And somebody was showing me mine from last year and I couldn't really read it. It was like diagrammed out, though. And then we were watching some kind of a movie, and then Melinda came and looked at me and said, ""Let's go."" And then I'm riding in a brown car with her, with brown seats in it. And we go to this restaurant and we're ordering this steak burger thing and all of a sudden she disappears, she takes off. And then I woke up."
"B-021"	"#B-021 (2001-08-20 (16)) Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, and that Ryan was over, and we were all sitting in the living room with Dad and talking about something; I don't remember exactly what. I seem to recall having a similar dream before. And Dad was sleeping and Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I were all out at the park, and I was carrying the silvery portable boom box down, and I was going to put it somewhere. And I was sitting on the couch with it, and I was playing a tape of sound effects that I recorded. And then I remembered that Dad was sleeping and I figured I'd better take it back upstairs. And then I said to Mom, ""I'm getting my exercise hauling this thing up and down the stairs."" And then all of a sudden I was under the water with a plastic bag [laugh] and supposedly I could hear Sebastian and Ursula's eels, and then I woke up."
"B-022"	"#B-022 (2001-08-22 (16)) I discovered this tape (Wee Sing tape), that we were at a little house that we were staying with Mrs. Hollander in and two other students, and I discovered this tape that I just described. And I put it in a boom box, and I started playing it, and it had ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and a couple of other patriotic songs on it, but it was totally different than what I just described it to be. That was strange."
"B-023"	"#B-023 (2001-08-23 (16)) This was the day after my first day of school. I dreamt that Dad was kind of crabby and that he was in Mom's workroom and I whispered to Mom something or other and somehow he heard it. And somehow he heard it and then he came in and started disconnecting the wires to my sound system, and I said, ""What are you doing?"" and then he made some kind of smart alec remarks and he said, ""I'm not worth anything to you."" And then I said, ""Well, think of all our walk time, all our family time."" And he said, ""Family time? Yech!"" And then I said something, I yelled something and then I slammed the door behind me and I ran out with Mom to go to the Thai restaurant with the firemen people. I think this dream was brought on be a subconscious overreaction to his teasing last night about I didn't use his binder and so he was teasing about he's just an old bird these days. Now I remember something else about that dream. After Mom and I walked out, we went to Circuit City and I think she was tell me she dropped something, and she was going to have to pay for it. I don't remember exactly. "
"B-024"	"#B-024 (2001-08-27 (16)) First of all, we were on the nature trail and we were walking along looking at different things -- Mom and me and my sisters, Samantha and Sandra, and Derek. And we were showing pictures in the picture album; we took a few more pictures. And then we came home, we stopped on the way home at like a big service merchandise store thing. And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I'd done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn't even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then Dad was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on. And then I was with Brad and Randy and Mark from Home Improvement, trying to make them work something out, and showing them our family pictures. And then I woke up."

We had Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and Grandma and Grandpa, and Grandpa was doing the passing. And Uncle Carl and Vince and Uncle Charlie were all little boys, and it was like it used to be. Carl got all kinds of nice things and the other two were real jealous. And before I knew it, somehow -- I don't remember unless we changed scenes -- like we were our family and we had all these little things in front of us, and then Dad said, ""I'm going to bring the presents out in a little bit,"" thinking that it was the big one. And I also dreamt that the magnifying machine in the dining room was a computer and that it was on and I had to hit control-alt-delete because something went really screwy, and then I remembered, and then I woke up."

And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she couldn't find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn't turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Warrior Vision room with Melinda and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and Mrs. Talmadge sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Melinda is teasing and she says ""Yeah, that's Jasmine, messing up your room in there."" And then we go out a back door and we're in this field thing, and then I'm with Mom, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I'm tired; can you tell? [sigh] There were these kids around and so I can't. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I'm in this church and I'm auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Hanover. And they give me a song that's completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff. And I have a microphone and the board is right behind me and I'm trying to adjust things to make me sound a little bit better. Then I woke up."

And it was a little different than the usual story really is because, first of all, there were only a few events in it. Eric and her had a few more dates before they got married, and King Triton was never in the scene. And she stayed a mermaid while she was up on land with him. It was just so weird, so strange, so different. And after the movie was over, I woke up."

And I got on the bus and I realized that I didn't have any shoes on, but then I looked down and I saw my sandals, so I put my sandals on. And I got to school and I was walking in the hallway and it was almost dark, and I realized that they were going to not like me wearing my sandals, so I was going to call Mom on the pay phone to bring them and to give me my other shoes. And I just thought about them and they were on my feet and I didn't have to call Mom after all. Later we walked out to the football field and it was real cold and there were several little fires going. And there was one that was almost burned down, and I put my hand in the embers to get a little statue of a parrot out of there, and it didn't burn me at all, it only tingled a little bit so I figured I'd better get away from here before the teacher sees me sticking my hand in the fire. And then, after I pulled the statue of the parrot out, it started burning big again, and Mrs. Hollander and Mrs. Dougherty and I sat down on the bench in front of it to keep us warm, because it was cold. And Mrs. Dougherty's voice was getting lower and lower, and I was really afraid that she had been hurting it yelling at the class, which she never did."
"B-030"	"#B-030 (2001-09-04 (16)) I had a dream last night that I was in a hospital for some reason. I didn't feel like I was hurt or sick or anything, but for some reason I was in a hospital. And Melinda was in the hospital. I think she was either in the hospital or visiting me. But there were two rooms that we got to roam around, and one of them was my room and it was like all messed up with other people's junk. And I don't remember if it had one or not, but the other room had a radio that was kind of falling apart, and it was turned on and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. It had a CD player top thing to it, but the lid came off. [laugh] And things were just all falling apart on it. And eventually I got it to shut off somehow. And then I was talking to her about what would we do if we ever had a fire drill in here, and then this message came over the intercom that they were going to have one. But here's the funny thing: the funny thing is that the fire alarm sound was going to be like frog's croaking, and that was how there were frogs croaking outside when I woke up."
"B-031"	"#B-031 (2001-09-05 (16)) I was at a boarding house somewhere. I thought it was somebody's birthday. And before we celebrated the person's birthday, we had to have everybody put their bags up on the table and have a writing essay thing as to describe somebody's bag that you think is neat. And I started out and before I knew it, it was Sandra's birthday, I think, and we had presents for her and she had presents for us. And we were going giving her her presents, and she was giving us ours, but I woke up before we could open them."
"B-032"	"#B-032 (2001-09-10 (16)) I had a dream last night that I had multiple handicaps and that I couldn't hold in my bladder, and that I had to wear pads all the time for if I had to go pee. And I would just have to let it go. And later I dreamt that I was at school in Mrs. Hollander's room and we were doing something, and I had to put my book bag somewhere, so I went in the auditorium and I put my book bag down. And the auditorium had no seats in it; it was just a big room. And then I heard Mr. Vaccaro's class coming and I went in the closet and closed the door. I didn't want him to see me. And then I figured it was just his students and it was safe to come out. Then I came out and got out and told Melinda that I had wet in the closet. And then I dreamt that I was in my room, in my bedroom with somebody -- two other girls -- and I was playing a destiny's Child CD, but somehow we could see them singing and performing. And they said, ""Don't they have strange outfits on?"" And I said, ""Yeah,"" because one of them had a table as a hat and a black and white dress."
"B-033"	"#B-033 (2001-09-16 (16)) The morning when Mom and Dad are supposed to leave town. It's 5:30 this morning, so I sound a little distant. Last time I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty was in Spanish class, and that she was going to teach us to sing ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" which was very appropriate. And Mrs. Dougherty comes over and sits besides me, and she said that she saw me in AP Spanish, which I really am not but in my dream I was, and that I should translate ""The Star Spangled Banner"" into Spanish while they were doing a staff writing sheet so that I could get some AP credit. And so I started in, and I can recall that I did it perfectly. I started with the first line, ""Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver"" (sp??) and I was having a little trouble fitting, ""by the dawn's early light, con la loof temprana de amanese (sp???)"" into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Melinda driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don't remember for sure what that was about. One other thing about this dream that I had, when I was translating ""The Star Spangled Banner"" and I could hear Whitney Houston singing it in my head, I started crying a little bit because I had such sympathy for my country and all, in my dream, of course. But I still had a tear in my eye when Mrs. Dougherty came over to talk to me again, and she thought that I was disappointed because everybody else got to hear it and I didn't. [laugh] Oh, it was funny!"
"B-034"	"#B-034 (2001-09-19 (16)) We were at school -- Melinda and I -- and I was running out of the Media Center full speed ahead and tumbling and rolling, hoping that I could get out of there before they caught up with me because I didn't want to do what they wanted me to do. And then I came back in because I knew I had left them in the dust and I didn't want to leave them in the dust, so I came back in. I bumped face to face into Mrs. Talmadge, and she started telling me how, she was like, ""Melinda told me your father's back-up alarm scared you when you were little, and I understand you're afraid of 'oo' sounds and my name has 'oo' in it."" [laugh] You know, I never thought about that consciously. That's weird. Ooo-oo-ooh. But anyway, then when we were at the fire headquarters, and I was supposedly playing a computer game in virtual reality and I was running up the stairs with this like three-quarters of a birdcage that I was holding onto. And it was around my body and I was like holding it up. And I bump into Sharon and George, and they start saying, ""Oh hey, how are ya? And how'd you like the trip up to the river, and all?"" And then I woke up."
"B-035"	"#B-035 (2001-09-21 (16)) I was going to show Mom where the Warrior Vision room is, and it was supposedly in the Bell Building. And it was past the bathrooms and now, in my dream, it was turned into somebody's bedroom, almost like a hospital room, only it was really pretty decorated. And I asked Mrs. Talmadge, ""Where is it this year?"" and she handed me a set of keys and led me down this set of stairs in like a cellar in the Bell Building. And then before I knew it, the steps led to outside. And she lifted this cover off the ground and showed us a little panel about twelve inches long and about six inches wide with just two or three knobs on it and said, ""This is our panel. This is what we use. This is the extent of our equipment now."" And she lifted another cover and there were these mint candies in that cover, and I took a handful. And she lifted another cover and there were cinnamon candies, little green ones. And then I woke up. That was strange."
"B-036"	"#B-036 (2001-10-04 (16)) Mrs. Dougherty and the class was over here and they were going to practice, we were going to practice in our living room and give Mom and Dad a concert. And so we were warming up in our living room, and that was neat. And we had this cake that looked like a dollhouse with all these little figures in it, and on top of it and in it and stuff. And I was sitting on the floor of my room cutting it up and putting plates of cake on the steps for everybody. And Gerard got one with a parrot and a dolphin, and Mrs. Dougherty got one with a big bear, and she said, ""Make sure I get a plate with french fries."" And so I piled all the french fries to hers. And then we were walking in this restaurant, from table to table holding hands and singing. And we climbed up on this one table and were singing. And my voice was louder and more resonant than anybody else's. I think I had this dream because I was practicing our songs into the amplifier yesterday, and I went into a sound field that made me sound like I was in a big bathroom."
"B-037"	"#B-037 (2001-10-07 (16)) Dad and Mom and I were on a trip and he was telling me things. First of all, he was explaining to me the things in an elevator, and one of them was like a little hatch that you could talk to other people, and another was like -- I don't remember exactly what. But he was telling all these horror stories as to what could happen in an elevator, and how you could like fall ten stories. I was really nervous when we got on the elevator and went down to the ground floor, but we did. And then he wanted me to ride around the perimeter of this garden. First there was a little place where people could go in with a fan blowing out of it, then there was a little pool, then there was the air conditioner and then there was the other side opposite the house. I went around everything he said, but I didn't go past the air conditioner. So I don't remember anything more."
"B-038"	"#B-038 (2001-10-08 (16)) I was celebrating my birthday in the middle of October. I was trying to show Mom how to draw the amplifier in the living room and how to make the perspective when some people started showing up for the party and I realized that I forgot to call my friends and invite them to the party. But there were people showing up to the house that I didn't even know. They were really rough teenagers and stuff, and they were bringing presents. And one of them brought me a little church ornament from Spain. I remember I was going to tape the party, so I went up to get the recorder and I put a tape in it and it started making this squeaking noise and that meant it was getting eaten up. And I just put it there and I decided I didn't have time for that."
"B-039"	"#B-039 (2001-10-09 (16)) Krystal and I were going back and forth between her house to my house while Mom and Dad were out of town. First of all we were at her house and she had this beautiful little patio that turned out to be her front yard. And one time while we were running around her house she went in the back room, she did something, and the whole house started to tip on its side like the Titanic ship did. And I was holding on to the stair banister railing and my voice was gone and I couldn't yell for her. And she said that the guy living here was on drugs and that he was doing that. And then the next thing was that we were over at our house and I was setting up the Halloween game, and there was this one Halloween figure that I had forgotten about. And it was a witch with a little skeleton thing, and the skeleton twirled around and there was a man's voice that talked in this thing. [laugh]"
"B-040"	"#B-040 (2001-10-11 (16)) First of all I dreamt that I was watching ""The Little Mermaid"" and there was more to it than just the story that they had. And as per usual, my mind keeps making up more details. I dreamt that Triton and Ursula were doing it, and that's how he got all his princess daughters, and that Ursula was their mother. And after she had Aquada (the eldest mermaid in the movie), Triton took her to the, some meeting somewhere to kind of show her how things were done. And she was talking to like a teenager. And then the scary part was when she had Ariel and Triton had Ariel and they came to the part of the movie where he destroyed her human treasures. Instead of singing ""Part of That World,"" she sang ""Bluebird."" And then the movie ended. And I, oh my gosh. And once Mom was up in my room and there was this dinosaur soap that had broken in half and we called it a bluebird soap, and it wasn't really scary. And then I differentiated between the bluebird tape and the bluebird soap. [laugh] That was kind of funny actually. And then she put on this really pretty dress and decided she was going to go to the store, and I told her, ""Well, wait a minute. How in the world am I going to do this without you?"" because I was getting ready to record something, I don't remember what. And she said, ""We'll do it as soon as I get back,"" and I was like, ""Yeah, right."" And then the scariest part. I dreamt that Halloween witch could record people's voices, and it recorded somebody saying, ""If you want to have a dream in the category of ""pushed or drawn to danger,"" just turn on the radio and play ""Bluebird"" and you'll have your own."
"B-041"	"#B-041 (2001-10-14 (16)) I had a dream last night that we were reliving a movie about World War II and that we were doing it at like this park like Adventure Island and stuff. And first Mom and Samantha and Sandra would go off these steps and I was yelling after them, ""No, don't go that way!"" And so then they came down and we were swimming in this pool, and the side of it had these slime plastic spike things that, if you would put your hand on them, you would sink into them and be engulfed in them, your hand would be, and you'd never know what would happen in the pool. And so finally we were out of there somehow and there were all these people and everything. And this people-mover thing, we found out that Derek was now an officer and we were on this people-mover thing and it went to this hotel room. And I was standing like up on a thing looking down at Terri who was in the water, and I had a feeling they were filming a movie or something. "
"B-042"	"#B-042 (2001-10-22 (16)) I haven't been able to remember my dreams in a while. But I had one last night, and I dreamt that I had drawn some pictures. One was of a green guy that was supposedly Dad after he slammed on the brakes. I drew a picture of Mother Mary, of another girl, and some other figure -- I don't remember. And Mom had put them in a folder in the computer with a digital camera. She had taken a picture before her and saved it to a folder. And Dad and I were working on some animations that were in a program like a slideshow, like PowerPoint like we used in Mass Media last year, where you click on one and you see one after another after another like a slideshow. [laugh] And Dad and I were working on adding some animation to that, and adding a piece of MIDI music there and s that they were going to do a remake of the ""Titanic."" Oh, before all that, I happened to be riding a bike, the tandem, down the street without the front. [laugh] But anyway, we were going to remake the ""Titanic"" movie, and there was this lady going to show it, and she said that she wanted me to sit on the floor right up close because there were going to be kids come and sit behind me, right up close where the TV is and she was going to show some movie about the remake. And next thing I knew, I was down at the sea wall of Oceanside and I was standing on the little ledge down below where we used to jump off of, and there was a boom box on top of the sea wall. And I was getting ready to jump into the water. When I turned around, and I turned the volume of the boom box down some first, and then I jumped in the water and there was this inflatable ionic column floating around in the water that I grabbed hold of, and then I was swimming around and somebody was saying how the main thing in the movie is volume and how to visit their website and all."

Somehow I got to meet in this big white dome-like area with this black guy, walking beside him, and we were getting on this people-mover thing to get across this area. And for some reason he was talking about that he still had some slaves and that he was one. Let's see. Then I had another dream. Then I dreamt that Dad and I were up in the sound room doing something, and I don't remember what we were doing, but all of a sudden we were laying down and he had the remote to the receiver and all of a sudden, ""Born to Be Wild"" was playing while Mom was vacuuming downstairs and he didn't seem to mind too much. He was asleep. And ""Boom,"" the feminist song, started playing and I was hoping that he was still asleep. And then Mom turned on the power suck head of her vacuum cleaner and it was really loud and it sounded really strange, I moved over close to what I thought was Dad and I woke up and found out that it was Mom. The last dream that I had, I dreamt that we were all in a little theater and that I was sitting in a rocking chair in the very, very back of the stage. No, wait. First I was down in the bottom, and somebody called me up on stage and asked me what, what level I was, whether I was the first or second soprano, and I said, ""I'm the first."" She put me way in the back in the rocking chair that we have in our living room. And I'm laying there in the rocking chair, almost asleep, while we're singing and I'm like three half-steps lower than the rest of them, and I can't seem to be any higher. And it's Monday night already, and there's tons of people out there watching us and we're just not cohesive. Everybody, half the group is talking while the rest of us are singing. Ms. Dougherty was in this big, white tee shirt with white pants. I've never seen her in all white before, but in my dream she was. And another dream I had last night, I dreamt that we were having some kind of a party in the kitchen and Uncle Larry rode up on Mom's bicycle with his boom box in the basket, blasting. And I knew he was coming because I heard his boom box. And we started talking about sound stuff and all, and then I woke up."

And then we were driving in the car around the block party site and there were like 20 kids in line to take a ride on the fire truck. And the sirens were like unusually loud.

And they wanted everybody to sit down and turn a certain way, but we were all in the aisle. And we started singing, ""Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la."" And then we started going faster and faster, and I thought to myself how the words were tripping over each other, and how it got to be tongue twister when we started going faster and faster. And we got to, ""Fa la la, la la la, la la la,"" I had to go into my own octave, and that happened to be when Mrs. Dougherty was standing right next to me. And I kind of went up a little bit too high, I think. And then suddenly her and I were walking in the park together, like Mom and I do, and she started running and I held onto her one arm with both of my hands and we ran together. She said, ""This is good exercise."" And then she, with her other arm, puts her other around me and starts spinning us around and around and around, and then we start just walking again and she yells something, something like, ""Didn't That feel good?"" and I say, ""Easy, won't that hurt your voice?"" And she didn't answer. So we kept walking and before we knew it, we were home. And I told her I had to, it happened to be when Mom and Dad were home, and I told her I had to vacuum up some bird seed on the porch. And she said, ""Well, let me run home and get my car, and I'll vacuum for you."" And I said, ""No, you don't have to."" And she said she would vacuum for me.

And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like 9:30 at night, and I figured I'd better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department. And Mr. Vaccaro answered, and I was really a befuddled buffoon as to what to say. I thought at least Mr. Hanover would answer. And then I woke up."

And he brought me this set of stuff because he thought I would like to mix up concoctions and things. And, oh yeah, I was standing at the kitchen counter mixing some chocolate batter and all the food was on top and all the bits of chocolate were on the bottom, and I tipped the container over when I was mixing it, and the motor was running underneath the container, I guess keeping it warm or something. And I dropped the mixer ball and it somehow goes down the drain and the motor starts doing funny things. And I told Dad and he called the company, hoping they can come out here and take it out, but there was still another mixer ball, but it wouldn't work if the other one was stuck in the drain.

Okay, but anyway, Dad was off doing something and it was Mom and I, and we were coming down in an orderly fashion out of the hotel and standing in the parking lot without a bag or anything.

And when it goes forward, it doesn't do anything, but when it goes backwards, it makes the back-up alarm sound. And there were these ambulances things and stuff that would ride around the perimeter, and then Ms. Dougherty was busy running around doing things. But then we were in our kitchen and Dad was questioning Mrs. Dougherty about the way she teaches, and she's defending herself. And Mom says, ""Why does it matter, who cares?"" And he said, ""Well, even better if people are trying to contribute,"" and he goes in the bedroom, and her grade book happens to be sitting on the bed in the bedroom. And he looks through her grade book and he sees that she does actually have an orderly way of keeping things. And there's these CD's, these really flimsy CD's that are bigger than normal CD's that are running there and then we go around and we do different things, and we were talking about going to this restaurant, and then it's dark and we're on our porch and Mrs. Dougherty suddenly appears there, and she was talking about how she was thinking of doing this certain song.

And we were all sitting around, and I was sitting far away at first, but then I heard where they all were and I came with the left-over bowl and joined them. And I thought that they were singing the Westport High School alma mater, but that was some other group of people. And the thing that Sound & Vision shipped to us by accident was sitting behind our table and was like, it was like what do we do with it, and not related to the fact that that's not where it came from. And then I woke up."

I dreamt that we were in the back yard and that Lucy and Robert were planning to buy a house, and we had several rows of chairs set up in the back yard. And Lucy and Robert were looking in the window of our house, and they were going to tell the people in the back row, who were going to tell the people in the next row, who were going to tell the people in the next row until it got all the way to the front row, about the comments about our house. And it was supposed to be like a communication system without them having to yell. That was weird. And then I dreamt that we were in this hotel and this guy was kind of like overstaying his welcome. He didn't check out or something. And he wasn't supposed to be in that certain room. So they took him and they were going to take him to another room, and the other room was like a dark cellar thing like an elevator shaft, and they just threw him down the elevator shaft, and he went, ""Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....""

And she said, ""She was beautiful, but now she's cracked."" And the case and the CD were both cracked. And then we were running around the lake and we were playing a tape in this tape player that I'm using right now, and it's just this little thing about twice the size of the palm of my hand and it has a little strap on the side of it. But in my dream it had a much longer strap that would go over my shoulder, and I had it over my shoulder and I was running with it. And it was playing something; I don't remember what. And then I kind of woke up."

And we were going to take an intermission for a while, and I put it on tuner and, it started doing this thing where it went louder and louder all by itself. And so I took it and I held the knob and I kind of clicked it back into place, and then it was okay for a while. Then it started going down, down, down, down instead of up, up, up, and so then I had to kind of click it into place again, which is really not the way to do it in real life. "

And we got off and Mom called her to make sure she got to the place where she was going, and we were at lunch and then I realized it was 12:40 and there was no point in going back. Then I dreamt that I had Chemistry first period. Another dream I had was that -- I can't remember it now. "

And then I went up on the deck and was ready to dry off. And Mom was trying to convince me to listen to a personal player, but I was too chicken. Then I convinced Mom to go in the car and get our lunch and we sat in the car and listened to the radio and ate our lunch. And then I dreamt that we were staying at this hotel, Mom and me, and I think Mom and me and Dad was supposed to come later with Sandra and Uncle Charlie. And Mom and I had this room. I'm trying to think. Oh, we went out to dinner at the little restaurant that they had there, and I can't remember, this was something scary in the room. I don't remember exactly, but I dreamt that when Dad and Sandra got there, I gave Sandra this purple rose which was called a la la loo flower [laugh] and I wanted to sing ""La La Loo"" on a CD along with a harp playing it, which we really don't have a rendition with no words, but I dreamt that we did."

And we were crossing busy streets and going through alleys, and I was carrying Mom's little flat recorder, the black one that's flat. And I had the shoulder strap over my shoulder. It was kind of under my arm, the way I carried it. And I was playing the Wee Sing tape as we were walking, and for some reason or another I didn't want Dad to hear ""Bluebird"" when we came to it, and I kept hoping that somehow this tape would stop or something. And I don't remember exactly what the final -- oh, I remember. We had finished our walk before ""Bluebird"" was supposed to come on, and we got back to the house and I shut off the tape, and we went on with our day, and then I woke up.

I don't know what it was about the picture I was drawing, or anything, but oh, it was so embarrassing. I woke up relieved, but when I woke up, I didn't remember my dream until I got to school and I sat down at my desk. Every so often I'll have a dream like that, because the dreams tell the truth about your subconscious. "

Then I was watching a variety show, and they had Jackson Browne perform the Stay (Loadout) song. And then we were having this Christmas party, and Alicia was there, and Mrs. Andersen and Lawrence were all there. And it was Allison's birthday, I think, and Allison didn't come yet. And then we put on this CD of instrumental stuff, and Mrs. Andersen and I were singing. And I was telling Mrs. Andersen, I mean, I Mrs. Andersen was telling me that my grade was gift (?) of my voice, and I told her that Mrs. Dougherty really brings it out in me and she should volunteer for us sometime. And then she said that she had to go, but then she came back with this big jar, that was like a candle thing, and she gave it to Allison for her birthday.

And all of a sudden I was at school, and I needed a book from the library. And I went to Mrs. Thayer at lunch time and I was telling her that I needed to check out a book, but then when I got there, my memory went blank and I didn't know, I didn't remember what I wanted to check out. But then I just said, I made up a story that I needed a book about growing plants, and so she took me into the Warrior Vision room and she was looking on the computer for something, the card catalog in the computer. And Mrs. Talmadge was over working with the other people, but, and then I was eating my lunch and she handed me the book, and I said, ""Thank you,"" and she said, ""We'll have to make a lunch date some time.""

And I never did get to class before I started having another dream. I dreamt that we were at the, we were going to ride our bikes to the mall, and we did and we got there, and I was running along behind Mom and Dad with this pillow.

Then I went and I came into the auditorium and I sat down with four other people who were kind of in the auditorium; we were up in the balcony. And Mrs. Dougherty was kind of pacing around and talking to us, like she does, and kind of instructing the other people as to how they were supposed to stand and all when we went on stage, and then all of a sudden, in poured the class and they were noisier than anything. And they were just real loud and ruckussy in their sound filled the auditorium, and trying to get everybody quieted down, I don't remember exactly how. But we were supposed to be taking pictures for the yearbook, I guess, and everybody had to be in long pants and some kind of a shirt, which really didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's how it was in my dream. And then Mrs. Dougherty was explaining how some of the boys were so fat that they couldn't even sit down in their chairs. And then I woke up and it was like 6:00. Then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt, first of all, that I was in my bedroom and that it was daylight. And I had this bathtub full of Christmas decorations, which that's the place I was storing my presents for Christmas. But I was taking the bears out and putting them around, and this one bear I hung on the door, and it was this snoring musical bear where it had a three-way switch to just snore or just snore and play music too. And the other thing was this reindeer. It was just like the mechanical one that I used to have, only the mechanical one doesn't run any more. But in my dream the mechanical part didn't run, but for some reason it was playing 94.9 and it was sound, and that just made me go bananas in my dream. [laugh] I closed my door, I closed both of my doors so they latched in my dream, and [whispering] I kind of perched on the bed and then it was the bathtub that I perched on. It was so wild that I was kicking my legs around and stuff, and I was holding onto the railing. [regular voice again] Oh, that was another one of those embarrassing dreams. I hope nobody ever listens to this tape. And then when that wild episode was over, I came back into the bedroom from being in the bathtub, I came back into the bedroom, and there I found Mom on my bed snoring away, and I wondered how she got in there and what she saw.

And I went over to her and I talked to her, and she was this really high soprano that could hit this high B-flat, and she couldn't understand why I couldn't. And so I told her that, I told her to tell Mom and Dad to meet at the big Christmas tree at 7:00 o'clock. And then she kind of led us on this tour thing, and we went into this other foyer that had carpeting and there were like boxes and stuff all piled all over everywhere. And she watched me go into this other little room where I had to climb over boxes to get to her, and there was like a broadcast booth and I sat there in the back. And it turned out that this is Melinda's car and it's not a transmitter, but a receiver in there. [laugh] And Melinda's car drives away and drives back home.

And I'm waiting and waiting for us to go and Dad's on the computer and watching TV and talking to John and doing stuff and getting computer games, and we haven't been yet. And then I woke up from that one and I kind of drifted into another dream that we were driving around town up by Penelus (?) Park and Mom was scared to carry a two-way radio to keep in touch with me. I don't why, probably because I was, or I used to be, well, I used to be. I dreamt that I was at the radio station for my first day my title would be ""teletist"" -- and it looks a lot like my bedroom, and I was sitting down talking to either Katelyn or Lydia or somebody, and then I realized I was naked. And so I closed myself in my closet and I got some clothes on and then I came out and started doing some things.

And Ms. Garland kind of turned into Mrs. Dougherty and she was leading us in song, and then I realized that we weren't on a ship but we were in a building and I was singing with the group in this building. And then I went into this office and I started speaking Spanish to Lydia, who is the promotion lady at the radio station.

And so I went upstairs to get my sound system set up, get the mixer ready to take the keyboard and mix it with my voice. And I, for some reason the CD burner was sitting on my chair. And then I realized that there were two of them; there was one in its normal position and one that was sitting on my chair. And I was supposed to put it on top of the tape player, which is to my right when I'm sitting at my desk, and the amplifier and CD burner are to my left. And I was supposed to put the second CD burner on top of this tape player, and there was also this extra external CD player that would feed stuff into the mixer for me that I had to, and so I was stacking up all these units and then I turned the light off and I sit down and I turn on my amplifier, and the amplifier is just this massive, this massive receiver like I see in Sound & Vision and it's got this fluorescent display that these wild colors that change color with the tone that I hear. And it had a tape deck built right into it. I was like, ""Wow!"" And I exploring all these different functions, and I was listening to a Kenny Rogers tape in it and it sounded pretty good. It didn't sound as good as my other tape player though for some odd reason. And if I was listening to this tape and watching the display fluorescently change and the indicators flash, I slowly faded into consciousness and my radio came on and startled me awake.

[laugh] We also saw this box, this big Grand Year box that had a picture of Celine Dion, and it was a keyboard, a Celine Dion keyboard, and it was supposed to be a replica of one that she played. And Mom got it for me, and I was thinking to myself, surprising Mom by learning to play, but I was thinking how this Celine Dion keyboard was brown and it angled kind of slightly up like the mixer. And it was really strange because it had this stand-alone amplifier with an internal speaker, and I used a like speaker wire to connect it. I was sitting on the stairs with this keyboard on my lap and I connected it to this amplifier with speaker wire and I was going to play, and I was going to surprise people. And things kept happening and I never got to. I think they were going to the beach and walking along the beach and I was telling people that I was going to do it. Then I woke up. I never did get to do it. "

And we were kind of dancing at this little dance bar buffet restaurant on the cruise ship, and then we decided that we weren't going to, we decided we were going to get in little dinghies and go row alongside of the ship. And so I was in my little dinghy and I kept tipping it over like a canoe, and by the time I knew it, I was floating on top of it. And then all of a sudden we were at home, and Mom and I were blasting the sound system waiting for Dad and the fire people to come over and join the party. And some lady -- I think it was the HRS lady from Melinda's case -- came in and wanted some tea, some herbal tea from Mom. And she was real rude. And we ended up shutting off everything before the people got to the party. And then I woke up."

But Mom was going to bring Terri and Mrs. Dougherty over for tea or something. I knew I had to hurry up and get them in the oven so they'd have time to bake, but I couldn't get the darned things to stand up. But once I did get them in the oven, Hayleigh, something happened and Hayleigh pushed two very delicate plates off the shelf and they broke all over the floor and everything, so then I had a mess to clean up.

And Dad was showing me this ride that was like a race car and he said that if it was going to go on a roller coaster, it had to have three seat belts for the same passenger, one that goes on top of another. And they had to wrap around the front seat and go in the back seat so that they could be for two passengers. And all of this looked really scary, and I noticed that this car had something in it that most race cars don't have, which is in the audio system. And then we were looking around at some other different rides and seeing how wild they were, and we figured, ""Hey, let's go on this conveyor belt through this place."" And it was like a building with a couple of different things in it. And we went, we jumped on the conveyor belt and we saw this monster just running across it. I started running too and I couldn't figure out why we were running. And then we were at this show watching the Little Mermaid swim around this fish aquarium tank. It was supposed to be like she was singing a song, but we all know she wasn't singing in the water."

And it was playing and going on and going on like the stuff that it has and then a couple songs before ""Blue Bird"" I decided it wouldn't be such a good idea for us to hear that, so I shut off the tape and put on the radio. And soon after Flounder from the Little Mermaid was coming up to our blanket like a pigeon and he had claws like a bird and he perched on my hand for a little bit. And then he jumped back into the water and I jumped in with him and I swam around for a little bit. And then getting out was like no challenge at all. The water was like a few feet down from the sea wall and after that we were going to meet Mom at this far thing like Disneyland and there was this playground that we were going on and I was supposed to have a tape machine, because I was going to record all the noise and sounds and everything from the fair, but I guess I left it at the picnic area. It was really Mom's boom box and we were going to go see Mom on this playground. And we did and I found her sitting on the bottom of this like walk-in bird cage, and we started talking about different things, and we planned to go to this like show with elephants or something. But I woke up before we got there. That was weird! But I think it has a lot of roots of my past. In this dream about me singing ""Blue Bird"" I wasn't really scared; I just didn't feel comfortable playing it in front of Dad. And the Disneyland fair thing, there was a lot of, we went to Disneyland a lot when I was younger and we met up with Samantha, Sandra and Derek at different places. So that's that."

And I was mostly, I was standing like about two or three feet away with the wireless microphone and talking while Dad made some adjustments and some checks and some tests at the board. And then I was going to sing something but we really didn't have time. We had to pack up and continue on the journey home. And as we were taking down the Peavey system and putting it away, it was getting really dark and we built a campfire. And I dreamt that Dad told me he planned to bring me there for my birthday, and he said, ""I've been checking out your equipment"" and I was like, ""Why?"" And, ""Well, I want you to have a nice evening,"" which I can imagine what that would mean. And I said, ""Well, I would sure like to have the Peavey system along for my birthday thing.""

And I also had my vocabulary to do, and I was thinking maybe I could handwrite it, but I wouldn't get very far. And so typing up a storm and also something happened to the computer, and it gets this weird thing going on, like it shows the keyboard on the screen like highlight the letters as you type them. And in order to get rid of this, we have to like do a whole bunch of ""escape"" and all this stuff, and I haven't even saved my work to a floppy. And then I wake up with a start and I realize that the whole time I was typing I wasn't writing my essay, I was describing and writing about the system, the system from my EJ thing that's called the Escort 2000.

And I was supposed to go to the doctor and get this shot to take it away, but instead they gave me a pill and it was a pill, it was like an olive and had been soaked in juice. All the olive juice went down my throat with the water and kind of made my mouth numb. But the olive wouldn't go down. I asked her to cut it in half. She was looking around, she didn't have a knife, so we had to take it home and cut it in half. And in the second part of the dream we were walking with Grammy to -- I don't know -- just around the neighborhood, and we stopped at this church that had a fountain and everything and I wanted to explore while they walked through. Well, I went around the back and I climbed up the back steps and I perched on this little ledge and grabbed onto the window and I could see the sound board and stuff.

I never got to see the sound studio either. "

We were getting ready to sleep but I couldn't go to sleep, and I was like taking my shoes off and getting off into a recliner lounger that was sitting on top of two beds, straddling two beds. I was like wiggle, wiggle, wiggling around, and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and it was the next morning. Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly gave me this ""Wee Sing"" CD/ DVD-like thing and I was kind of afraid to look at it and stuff, and it played in my, you know, that Spanish thing, that Spanish dictionary. It played in the card slot. And then next thing I knew, it was on TV and they were alike singing songs like on the other ""Wee Sing"" tapes, except it showed them like playing in their tree house and stuff. And I know there was more to it, but I can't remember."

And Mom was like complaining that I wasn't doing the faders right or something, so I got up and I left. I shut everything off and I left, and I walked around the park and then I came back and I told Mom that when she did that, it reminded me of when I was in Mass Media and stuff, and I started mixing it again and then I slowly faded into consciousness, kind of like a fading in and out the audio.

And then descended the stairwell, which was totally in the dark for some reason. And then I was in the living room decorating this fan, you know like the fan we have in the living room that is portable? Well, I was decorating it with like these sequins that were supposed to represent MP3 files in some way. And there were light bulbs inside the fan that lit up, and Mom was suggesting to me that there were light bulb sockets on the outside and that I should take them off and put them on the outside. And then there was this light-up frog. I couldn't tell if it was a frog or an owl, and Mom was talking to me about somebody who gave it to me, and I was holding it like from the bottom, and this fan-thing inside of it like turned on and made a wind. I threw it down and it went dark, and then I woke up. How bizarre! How bizarre! [laugh]"

And he was showing us this light-up light system where the lights light up, and they'd like turn blue and the theater floor would actually like tip back and forth and back and forth to the rhythm of whatever was going on. And then the strobe light part would turn on and it would just go all out of control, and hopefully nobody was up walking around at that time, because they'd just fall down. And then we went out of the auditorium and we each had rooms there that we were staying in -- it wasn't really a hotel, but it was a place where people could stay. And I was looking for the bathroom, and I found it and I went in, and it was like this real loud engine motor thing in there, kind of like when you go in a plane bathroom. And then I was in my room, which looked like my room here. Oh, I know why we were staying there. We were staying there because we were going to take the SAT. Dad said, ""Call the office on the intercom and see if the SAT was ready to start any time soon."" And so I looked around and didn't see a thingy. Then, I spotted one way at the top.

And then I had to go to the bathroom and Mom was telling me to go across the street to the hotel and go up to the second floor and go in and use their bathroom, and I said, ""Why can't I just use ours?"" So I went around in the front and our double doors were much more ornate than they really are, and I knocked on them and pounded on them until finally she came and opened them.

And then we went in the restaurant to sit down and eat, thinking she'd come in the restaurant, but she didn't. We never saw her again. We went to this area that supposedly the family owned, and it was, it had this little nativity scene thing set up, and we were looking for the baby Jesus in the nativity scene, and we were like unlocking the manger, looking in there, and we didn't see it. And there were a bunch of tropical plants and things around, and then all of a sudden I was at school, taking the elevator to the third floor; I don't know exactly why, but I guess I had to talk to somebody.

[laugh] So we picked up that box, and we picked up a little wind-up helicopter for Bobby for Christmas, and I dreamed Bobby was still a little boy. And we picked up one or two other things; I forgot what they were. Then all of a sudden I was in school and watching Warrior Vision and saw that it had changed majorly. And they were giving us these little newspaper on civil rights, and so we just walked around to see how it had changed. And we found out that they were doing things a lot more on computers, and that the computer had taken over my job as the sound person and the b-roll job and the director's job. The only thing that needed to be somebody monitoring the VCR and somebody anchoring. And the board was kind of like off limits to everybody. And next thing I knew, I was back in there and they needed a sound person right away and I was doing the sound for this show.

And it would play like the station does; it would play about 20 minutes or so of songs and then about 5 minutes of ""Bleah, bleah, bleah."" And I was thinking how odd that was, and I was thinking it must have been they sent us in the mail. And then I dreamt that there was this other blue and white CD that I couldn't find the case for, and it was supposed to be something like Snow White soundtrack or something like that. And then I dreamt that I was putting two of them in a bag, like you do at the bookstore. I was putting like Maggie's Mo Jo with the Concert 90 and the blue and white one with Mariah Carey or something and two other Mariah Carey's together and so on and so forth, thinking that maybe I was going to organize them better. And then I dreamt that Mom had paint up the kazoo in the bathroom closet, and I was looking through them and half of them hadn't even been opened. It was like a stockpile for a store or something. It was totally ample. And I suggested that she move her tape rack into the bathroom and get a CD rack for her work room.

And in the house I was afraid for people to come to the door and ring the doorbell, and so on and so forth.

And the sound technician says, ""Well, I'm not the one to talk to, but I know this area is reserved for military people."" And so Mom and Dad recommended that I just go to my seat, which was at at the far end of the balcony where I really sat to see the Zarzuela (Spanish musical play). So I started climbing the stairs, and I got to the third floor, and there were living habitations up there with bedrooms and bathrooms and stuff. And somehow I knew that people lived up there. And I got so lost and so turned around up there that I just, I looked out the window and I was talking to Mom and Dad, I was like almost in tears. And they said, ""Just come on down the stairs and we'll be outside."" So then I was outside, and this was really weird.

But I was all distraught over the fact that he was going to crab and complain as to why did I call when I didn't need to. And the doctor who took time out of his schedule to check him out and see if there was anything wrong rigged a sound board in front of somebody's yard, like a booby trap, knowing that I would go up to it and check it out. Well, he rigged it so it would go, ""Whoop, whoop, whoop,"" and so all kinds of sirens and ""yoo hoo"" and stuff when I went up to it, but somebody we know cut the wires so that didn't happen, and I went up to it and I checked it out in this person's front yard, and I turned it on and it started doing what it was supposed to do.

We had a big boy named Quinn, like in his 20's, we had a big Derek, about 17 or so and we had a little Derek who was like 8 or 10. And the two big boys were alright; the girls were kind of reserved and shy like I was probably at that age. And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Derek was scary, though. He had red hair and he would run around. He was a boisterous little thing. And, you know, I think I saw him near the keyboard a few times. He was carrying it around and running through the woods with it. And I can't remember too much about what happened during the dream or anything. I just remember that whenever the little Derek was around, I was really scared. And that's all I can remember. [Mom: I think you can identify with the big Derek, because he's your big brother that you talk to on the phone with music and stuff. But the little Derek is the little guy that scared you with the noises when you were little, and in your dream you've kind of combined both of them because they always, there was a while there where Derek and Ronnie were wearing camouflage and they were big boys compared to you when you were little.

Okay, I can't remember any of the miscellaneous that were going on beforehand and some other little side dreams, but I do remember the main part. I dreamt that I had been practicing on the keyboard and I had it plugged in with an AC adapter to the extension cord under my dresser, and it was set up on top of its box on the bed so that I could stand up straight and sing, but still be able to see the keys like I did that one time when they were at the movies. And all the lights were off in the bedroom and I was talking to Mom in her work room. And I go in the bedroom and I turn the lights on, but for some reason, me turning on the lights powers up that extension cord underneath my dresser -- it doesn't really, but it did in my dream. And having power at that AC adapter powered up the keyboard, even though I didn't turn it on. And that familiar robot voice that greet us and I was like, ""Oh my gosh, you mean to tell me I didn't put it away?"" And so, and then it said, ""Select a song."" And then it starts playing this song because, see, in real life it can do this song demonstration thing, and when you activate it, it says, ""Select a song."" So we did that, but it started playing this song to demonstrate, but it was like a Celine Dion song from 94.1. That was kind of cool. And then Mom wanted me to teach her how to do some things and teach her about the notes of the staff and all, so I turn it off for a minute and I go to my desk and I draw a five-line staff and I start labeling the lines and spaces on scrap paper. And I'm ready to go back and give it to Mom and start teaching her, and next thing I know, she's back in her room sorting her papers and I missed my chance to teach her and show her. And then I woke up, and I was so mad when I woke up. I think I had this dream that I missed a chance to show her something because I don't want to be too stuck on a one-track mind. I've been thinking a lot about that lately, and I've been practicing on it every chance I get when there's nobody in the house. And I really am dying to show Mom some music theory and stuff, but I don't want to just, I'm so shy, and it's like when I bring this thing out and am practicing on it, I swear I'm never going to tell anybody.

And it wasn't connected to any amplifiers or anything, so I don't know how she got sound out of it, but I remember it was pretty, kind of neat, and I was thinking, oh, she could finally play CD's and maybe she'll start getting rid of her tapes. And then I dreamt that Mom had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with Mom, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, Mom told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but didn't want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV. And what do they call that -- obstetrician? [Mother: for the woman; for the baby it's pediatrician.] But I mean when the baby's pregnant. [Mother: no, when the mother's pregnant with the baby.] [laugh] [Mother: you mean the mother's going to have the baby, not the baby's going to have the mother.

And then I was just sitting down doing nothing, and I had my mini-disc recorder for the radio station, but I didn't have the personal CD player. Next thing I knew I was riding home in the car with Dick Jorgenson, and he was talking to me about editing and stuff, and about -- I forgot my personal CD player, but I could have transferred some songs to the mini disc player so I could have one thing to do both jobs.

And then next thing I knew, I was still laying down on the stage while they were doing all this, they were putting ""Planet Soul"" on the CD player and they're playing it [laugh] , and next thing I know we're all standing up and we're posing for a picture. And there's this little boy, and then when we were standing up posing up for the picture, I realized that we were in the Oceanside Elementary School cafeteria, and there's this little boy down at the floor level where the lunch tables are, and he said, ""Smile for the picture. Thank the sound engineer."" And then somebody flashed a camera and then I woke up."

And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And [sigh] then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, ""I'm three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you."" And I don't remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up."

And I was still inside rummaging g around, trying to get all my CD's together and stuff. And it took me like a half an hour to an hour to get them all together and ready. And then I came outside and it was dark already and there were some more people. And I was going to, I sat down at my table and I was putting this CD in, and everybody was just kind of totally like they didn't even hear it, and nobody was dancing, they were just all kind of ""duhhhhh,"" like they just didn't even hear it. So I put on something else and I crank it up a little louder, and they still just like kind of ""duhhhhh,"" like they don't even hear it. And I can't remember what I did, but I think I just was totally not ready and my system was cuckooing out on me and stuff, and it was just a real bummer of a party."

And we stayed on one side of the park that looked like Circle Lake and then we were at this petting zoo section, but we didn't go in the section where all the rides and the show and stuff are that I'm familiar with. We mostly just stayed at one end of the park and walked around and stuff. And then we met up with Dad over at the petting zoo section and all the girls went on to do something else, and I was stopping and talking, and I was standing under the post of the fence of the petting zoo and I was talking and she said that there's this, he was glad we stayed on this side and all. And I was thinking, ""Yeah, of course she would be."" And there was this person that was going to do a concert show that was a guitarist from the '50's, and I didn't know the difference in my dream between a gunner and a guitarist, so I kind of thought that guns were like guitars and guitars were like guns. I don't know why I would think something so whacko. I mean, they're, I don't know, they don't even make a similar sound. Well anyway, and then I dreamt that we were home and I was looking around the house as if it were Six Flags, trying to find stuff, and then I realized I was at home and I shouldn't even be looking. Then I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, which they were because they were at Six Flags with us. And they were, I mean, I was laying in bed and Derek was like in the shower and he had this tube and he was spraying water at me and stuff. And so I closed the door. Then he came in with a cup of water and I thought he was going to pour it on my head, but instead I like got him in a wrestling hold, and he was like, ""Ahhh, you gave me snake bite."" And I was thinking, ""What in the world is a snake bite?"" And we started like kind of wrestling and the cup of water just kind of went away, and he kept saying, ""Ah, you gave me a snake bite!"" And then I dreamt that that all went away and I was kind of snuggling with Sandra the way I snuggle with Mom and I was telling, I felt comfortable enough to tell her the story of way we found the keyboard, and I started asking her if she remembered when we had it, and she said, ""Yeah, I know. Your mother kept asking us to take it each time we came, and I didn't want to take it because Dawn [their real mother] said don't take stuff from you."" And I was just like, ""Okay,"" I wasn't hurt or anything, I mean, I was just sort of like, ""Okay."" And I was drawing little bitty pictures in this notebook while I was talking to her. Somehow And I didn't tell her the rest of the story; I never did. And then I woke up. Oh, and I dreamt that the time said like 10:35 and when I woke up it was 7:30."
"B-143"	"#B-143 (2002-07-13 (17)) Okay, this is sometime in the middle of July, 2002. Last night I dreamt that I was at Bancroft Middle School, but I was in Warrior Vision from Westport High School, and I was sitting there at their board and it had a blue faders except they weren't uniform all the way across. The mono-mike channels were pots and the rest were blue faders, and I was trying to work this board and we were under a lot of stress to try and get this show done right now, and Mrs. Talmadge was trying to get us to do something. And then the bell rang and Melinda came over to me and said that Mrs. Hollander's class was going to be in the auditorium. And then all of a sudden the halls and stuff were like at Bancroft, and Mrs. Hollander's class was up on this other floor and I had to run up to her room and get my stuff. And then I was like running through the halls to get to the auditorium on time. I had books in my arm, but no bag, and I was running through the halls and I was coming down a stair thing and I fell face first, I was like falling down the stairs and then I woke, and my books went everywhere and I woke up."
"B-144"	"#B-144 (2002-07-14 (17)) Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, ""Wow, girl!"" And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they weren't ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I wasn't steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I didn't want Dad to know that I ""drove"" even though I didn't drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, ""Nah,"" and I don't remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up."
"B-145"	"#B-145 (2002-07-25 (17)) First of all, this was after everybody left and after all the dust settled and I could start remembering my dreams again and I wouldn't get so tired. I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and I was all dressed and ready to go, and I had my book bag and my books and stuff. It was going to be my first day. And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control. And I went in there and I got myself all wet. They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, ""Alright."" And then I got my shoes and stuff and told Mom about it, and I don't remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, ""Where is that coming from?"" and Samantha pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, ""This is a magic chick; now watch it."" And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, ""Hi, I'm a magic chick. If you want to play magic,"" something about the something blue. You'd have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something. And then it would say, ""Hi, I'm a magic chick, if you want to play magic,"" something like that, and then it would start to play this recording of when I would do magic shows. That was like weird. "
"B-146"	"#B-146 (2002-07-27 (17)) My birthday was fast approaching. I was at the fire station and they were making me this birthday cake. They like putting roses and stuff and sprinkles and I would go over and snitch some. And they were gearing up for a birthday party for me, but then I remembered that my birthday wasn't until March, and then what in the world were they doing, getting ready for a birthday for me? And as I was getting my stuff ready to go out the door, the parrot started singing, ""Happy birthday,"" to me. [laugh] That was kind of weird. Then I dreamt that I was taking a music class in college, and that this kind of Spanish lady was teaching it. And we were going over some theory and stuff, and she was surprised at how much I knew. And she was saying how she's going to have to catch me up a little on what I missed. Then I dreamt that there was this battery charger thing that was supposed to absorb the acid if they corroded. It was like a traveling duffel bag, and it was for the keyboard. It was like put the batteries in all in series, and Mom said that it reminded her of cow poop, the way you put them in. And then they would gather (?) they would provide 9 volts and then you would plug it into the adapter. And [laugh] I don't know, somehow we had the notion that that would make it work. And I woke up before we could test it out."
"B-147"	"#B-147 (2002-08-01 (17)) I was starting school and that things had really, really changed. We were in this auditorium that kind of put me in mind of a cross between the Hayes High School auditorium and the gym at Bancroft Middle School. The seats were not just slanted a little bit, but they were like way slanted like bleachers are. And they were different colors like in the Hayes High School auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage. And I had the notion that for chorus class there was going to be this male performer opera singer going to teach it, and for some reason I had the notion that he wasn't as good, that he was very basic. And I reasoned in my head that the more advanced classes were going to be taught by Mrs. Dougherty, but that this man was going to teach kind of the introductory and beginning and basic classes. And I can't remember too much, so I woke up."
"B-148"	"#B-148 (2002-08-05 (17)) The kids were still in town, and that Samantha and Sandra I was having such a good time with, and I was really sad about them leaving. But for some reason I was remembering a lot of things in my childhood to do like with Bluebird and stuff, and I was pacing around upstairs, and I was really nervous. And it seemed that all the girls were taking a shower and Derek was reading, but I came downstairs and I thought I heard Derek playing the keyboard in the bedroom. And I know this is really stupid, but I'm going to have to say it anyway in order so that I can analyze my thoughts later. I dreamt that in order for the keyboard to work, we had to bake a cake, and there was this cake. And [laugh] everybody would eat a piece of the cake, and when it was all gone, it wouldn't work any more. And I don't know what the connection was or why that happened like that, but it was weird. And it wasn't anything wild like he used to do. He was really sincerely trying to learn a song, and it was the Entertainer song that the ice cream truck plays all the time. And let's see, I dreamt that we also had a pineapple cake and a pear cake that I really wanted a piece of, but apparently Mom said they had containers that snapped shut and she couldn't get them open without making a whole bunch of noise. But she wanted to save them for when it was just us, so when I wanted a piece of cake, I had to have the other cake that made the thing work. That is so bizarre. How bizarre; how bizarre. And I also remember that later on I got my school schedule, and we had to whip up this like cake mix in order for my schedule to coincide. [laugh] And it was this like real powdery, awful-tasting cake mix we just had to whip up, and we had to spread it all over everywhere. [laugh] And I dreamt that I was going around on my first school schedule and that I stayed back and was talking and talking with Mrs. Dougherty with Mom, and that I missed Math completely, and there was an absence on my first day. And Dad was complaining about it, and we said, ""What's he complaining about now?"" And there were these pictures, and there was one of Mrs. Gresham, there was one of Mrs. Hollander and there was one of Mrs. Dougherty. There were these pictures that were like photo pictures, I guess. And Mrs. Hollander's was bigger than life, and it was like almost poster size except it was just the head. And she had a blue background, like she had this beaver outfit on like she was this beaver on stage, and her hand was extending off to the side into the next picture. And her hand was extending like almost over the top of the Mrs. Dougherty picture, except you could still see her. It was just that the hand was in the way of the picture. And I dreamt that I was going to enlarge the other one and fix it up and get rid of Mrs. Hollander's hand and all, so that hers would be bigger than life. Now I think that could have some meaning to it because Mrs. Hollander is pretty vain and stuff, I think, and [sigh] so, I think, and that's it. That was bizarre, huh?"
"B-149"	"#B-149 (2002-08-06 (17)) I had one of those stupid dreams I could have sworn I've had before. Has anybody ever had some of those? Well anyway, I dreamt that I was sick and that I was going through cards at my desk. And somehow I had the notion that I was in a Bible school for elementary kids. I think that came from Melinda's church and all. But then I had this card that was signed by Celine Dion and I just knew I had to keep it safe with my other memoirs and stuff. And then I had this goofy, goofy card, it said, ""Oldies 95.1"" and it was like all gold and silver and stuff and it had a hole in the middle where you put -- I don't know -- a pin or something.

And apparently a fire got started, a little fire with some of the matches, and Dad was showing me how to put out the fire that distracted me from being scared of the voodoo in the ""Snake Bite"" song. And then I dreamt that there was this movie that Mom and Dad were going to see. It was in the middle of some kind of a theme park. And how they would do it was, it would be totally, totally, totally dark in the place where they would go and stand, and this mask that they would put on would be blue. And they would not see anything until the movie would come on, and sometimes that would be a little scary. And I don't remember too much else, but it was kind of fragmented last night."

But anyway, we were still in Spain and we were all roller blading down the street, and then we were going to go see a show of somebody rollerblading. So we got in these escalators and held onto the railings. They went twice as fast as normal ones do. I think maybe even three times faster. We went up four or five of them until we got to like this place where there were chairs for everybody and a little road thing. And I sat on a ramp right in the front, and my feet like dangled into the middle of the road thing, and then Mrs. Hollander told us that we were too early and we have to come back in a half an hour. And then I had another dream that we were at dinner, and we were eating and eating these things. And I had already had a course, and this Spanish waiter came by with this tray with six compartments in it and gave me two spoonfuls from each compartment, and it was like, ""Oh gosh, more to eat?"" And I had some water that I was drinking, and then I was offered some vanilla ice cream and it turned out to be milk. And then I had another dream that we were walking around we went in this church. Let me think a minute. I remember more to it now. Some of our group was performing up there and going to sing and play their band instruments, and Clark and Marilou and Colin Hanks were sitting by the sound board, and Marilou was going to run it. And she was showing it to me and showing me all the things about it. And it was silvery with white faders, and it had these little white levers that you could make it say certain words, so you could just like make them say these words. And then the preacher came up and was preaching about these boys that all they wanted to do was fight and broke things up. And there was an image of some men up on the wall and the priest asked, ""What would you do if this image wasn't there?) and these wives would stand up and say, ""You stole our husbands' image.""

And so we sat back down. He put this like practice thing up on the overhead, he gave us each a little notebook about the size of a, about four times the size of a matchbook, and it had little tiny shapes of staff paper in it. It was kind of like a measure note pad, and we were supposed to, except these little pieces of staff paper were like dated and titled and stuff, and we were supposed to keep our little practice things in it. And he was going to collect them, like writing a sharp on this line and putting this something-or-other on that space, and what does this mean, what does that mean and stuff like that. I don't remember too much about what it was.

And I was walking around and looking at different stuff, but I saw a bunch of furniture and stuff in addition to that. Then I went up to the front counter, and the lady at the front was so impressed with me and she was showing me these things that she had in her display case. First she showed me a porcelain music box rocking horse with this saddle that was made out of this really, really soft material, and it was ornate and stuff. And then she showed me this snow globe that was in the shape of a Santa face. It was flat and it was plastic, and when you tip it upside down, the lyrics to ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" -- each word was on a little black piece of plastic and they would all just kind of fall into place and be suspended in the water, and you'd tip it upright again. And then lastly she showed me this show globe that had a cardinal in it, and it was like the one with two cardinals from M____ that ________. And it was part of that collection.

And he was telling me about how he likes to play the trumpet. And I guess it was Thomas, because Thomas plays the trumpet. And he was saying how a keyboard is such a great thing because you can make it make all kinds of different sounds. And if you don't really play a certain instrument, but you want it in your song, you can make it make that sound if it's the right kind of synthesizer. And by this time I was like swinging on a swing, hanging from one of these stairwell things, and I think Mom comes in from the pouring rain and we go in that small little kitchen, and Melinda's asking about a mini disc.

And then when we finally did get out of there, we went to these people's wedding, and I was so mad because we didn't get there to catch the beginning of the wedding. We got there like after the ceremony was over. And I can't even remember who it was, but I had the notion that I was one of the bridesmaids for some odd reason. Then were at Westport High School and I was asking Melinda how I went with Mrs. Dougherty because she had talked to her the day before, and she just said that she wanted Melinda to help her collect notebooks and things. And that's that."
"B-161"	"#B-161 (2002-08-25 (17)) We were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn't screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn't see them. And I don't remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I don't know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting. [laugh]"
"B-162"	"#B-162 (2002-08-27 (17)) We were watching this movie in the living room on the TV. It was about these fish and how they act, and how they kind of like babysit each other and stuff. And that's all I remember about that, and then some thunder woke me up. But then, when I went back to sleep, I dreamt that I was looking at these clocks because I was doing something before and I can't remember what I was doing. I sat here and thought about it a little and I can't remember. So I was looking at several clocks and I realized that neither one of them was giving me the right time. They had crazy whacko things. And then I woke up when my alarm woke me up, and I realized what time it was."
"B-163"	"#B-163 (2002-08-29 (17)) My friend Cathy and I from freshman year skipped 5th period and she drove me over to some, she drove me over to Roanoke's, the health food store, and we got spinach rolls and spaghetti and meatballs and we took the food to the park. And we sat on a bench and we were talking and talking about all kinds of different stuff. And we were talking until like 5:30 pm that night, and then she took me home. And I had no idea what time it was, and Mom and Dad weren't really mad or anything, but they were wondering why would I be out so long with somebody and not call them and let them know. And I guess that was all."
"B-164"	"#B-164 (2002-08-30 (17)) Mom and Dad were getting ready to take a trip and that for some reason they were going to go to Eastport Airport and fly to Westport Airport, which seemed really, really strange because they could just drive to the Westport Airport. And so when they were in the parking garage, everybody was oohing and ahhhing over their car and stuff, like they always do, and for some reason we had all of my equipment set up outside, and I had to bring it inside because it was going to rain. And I just took it one piece at a time and started bringing it inside, but I didn't get too far because Mrs. Dubois came over and said she was going out of town. And her daughter wondered if I wanted some Halloween things that she had. And then I woke up."
"B-165"	"#B-165 (2002-08-31 (17)) Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Clementine Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I couldn't find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time's getting short and it's really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there weren't three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I didn't care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They weren't there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound & Vision in the back seat of the car. [laugh] And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I didn't need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it wasn't on. It wasn't like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I don't know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Clementine Springs; I wonder what that could mean."
"B-166"	"#B-166 (2002-09-03 (17)) I had this dream, and it's 4:30 in the morning, and now I am wide awake. [laugh] But, oh well, this dream is quite interesting and encompasses a lot of different things. First I dreamt that I was in the bedroom and I was trying to set up a two-channel stereo system. Or no, I was trying to fix the speaker connection because they'd come undone. So I shut off the receiver and unplugged it just to be safe. And I was making the connections with the binding posts -- you know how that goes -- and I dreamt that in my dream we had a sub in the bedroom, which we don't. And that seemed to be alright; I didn't have to do anything like that. So I fixed the connections and then I turned the receiver back on and I was putting the speaker back in place, and the wires came undone. And I was real afraid to touch them because, of course, when the receiver's on they're carrying power and I knew not to touch them or I'd be shocked. And then I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake. By the way, this dream is going to probably take up the whole of this tape. I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake and it was really cool, and he was kind of joking, like he is, about ""Don't let Mom get all the cake,"" and stuff, and we were deciding on sizes for the cake by how many faders we have because we were cutting the cake with lines and we were cutting it according to, like we would say, ""I want four of these channel strips, so I want two of the shell (?) strips,"" and that would be how we'd know what sizes of the cake we want. Then I dreamt that I was writing these notes about how my life is being changed over the years, and I was writing these notes so that I could write this essay. And I was writing about the different phases that I went through, like first it was the toddler stage and then my animal magic show stage was 6-9, and I said that I had went through a real shy phase when I was little, which I really didn't, but in my dream I thought I had. And in all of this Dad asked about the music major, and, of course, I hadn't said anything, I haven't said anything to him about it. So I just kind of said, like I just kind of like beat around the bush, I guess. And he asked about it more directly again, and I was kind of stunned. Well, actually, I wasn't really too, too stunned yet, and I just said, ""Oh, we found it like 20 years later and it needed work,"" or something like that. I then I stepped away to do something and he's baking another cake. Or I think then I come home from shopping with Mom, and there it is, sitting on the table, and all the flour and all the mess. And it's like sitting there in all its glory, and I'm like stunned. [laugh] But the thing of it is, Dad thinks he can connect the mixer cake to it. [laugh] And it was hilarious because it's not even a real mixer he's trying to connect to it. And I know for a fact that it didn't have any a______ or audio out, but I was able to mike it and record it through my mixer. [laugh] Here he is, trying to connect a mixer cake to it. And I'm like, he's having Mom and I help him like move stuff, and I'm like grabbing Mom's wrist and like doing the intermittent grip signal, like, ""Oh my gosh, what in the world is happening here?"" And I hated to see it in all the flour and all the mess, but [laugh] everybody was trying to connect it to a real mixer. Oooohhhhhh! But, and then, I had one more part to this dream. I guess you could see why I'm wide awake! Then we were in Cash and Carry and we were looking at Easter bunnies, and over in the Easter Department we were looking at Easter bunnies and I was dancing to this disco music under this strobe light. [laugh] I guess I meant what I said in my song when I said, ""When I run through the pastures of my slumber, you're never out of sight."" I feel I need to add to this that I didn't really feel was important, but now I see it could have some meaning. I dreamt that I was wearing a tee-shirt with a picture of it on it, almost like the tree bird shirt, only it wasn't. It was the color of the tree bird shirt and it had a picture of it on it, only I was walking through Cash and Carry. And I think maybe this could mean that some day -- how should I say it -- I think that I mean to say that some day I'll be brave enough and confident enough to tell the world its story and wear it openly on my heart instead of hidden the way it is now. And I don't know -- I just [sigh] , I've just still got this shy thing going on, I don't know."
"B-167"	"#B-167 (2002-09-10 (17)) The only thing I really remember about my dream last night is that we were at this festival thing where we were getting ready to see this concert show. These girls were going to come out on a big stage and start singing. It was like in a big open space; there were no seats or anything. And so Dad and I were getting ready to get a really good spot. And he takes me and he puts me up on the stage where I can talk to the girls, and they're like sitting there setting up their instruments. They're like high school age. And I talked to them like, ""Hey, how you doing?"" and stuff. And then we come back to this boardwalk and we were standing out on the boardwalk just looking at stars and stuff, and that's all I remember."
"B-168"	"#B-168 (2002-09-14 (17)) You know what, guys? This is a horrible tape, and I should know never to use it again. It's getting old and it goes, ""Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak!"" And it's got these little breaking up on the cell phone type of sounds when you play it back, so I'm never using this horrible tape ever again. Let's have a go. For a simple mono voice track, one voice up close that doesn't really record a whole lot, yes I will use this horrible tape. And some -- I don't know -- I used to think it was years, but now it's like a couple of months down the road I might be able to rip all my dreams to MP3 files and put four or five tapes on one disc, because I don't have to worry about the big long explanation, I'll explain it later. Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like Mom and I sit sometimes when she says, ""You big baby."" And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street-like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning -- the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I didn't have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I didn't have time in the morning; it was like 8:00 o'clock already. But now it's all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up. The bit I do remember is that we were supposed to, we were gearing up to go to this Sweet Adelines workshop and next thing I know, Dad and I are in the car and Mom's riding her bike alongside, and then I woke up."
"B-169"	"#B-169 (2002-09-15 (17)) We were at this house with Grandma and Grandpa and Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Lucy and Robert and Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry, and I think Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were there too. It was like a family reunion. And, you know, I think they were all, I don't remember Lucy and Robert or Aunt Janice being there. But anyway, most of them were there. And I even think Ms. Terwilliger (?) was there and Aunt Janice was in this blue dress. We were all sitting in the living room and this house had like a white tile concrete floor and it looked like a typical modern house. And I didn't know whose house it was, but it was one of their houses. And whoever's house it was, but there was this side room like a dining room almost, except there was no dining table. There was a keyboard in there too, and we were all sitting out in the main room talking, and there was this dog that was running around. And then we decided we would all move into the side room for some reason [laugh] and the keyboard was by this time kind of in the way, kind of half blocking the doorway and they were kind of worried that I was going to knock it over. But, of course, I just kind of stood there and like stared for a minute at it, and Ms. Terwilliger told me not to touch it because she had no idea what it was going to do or sound like. So we all sat down on this little couch thing and we started talking. There were chairs and a couch in this room, and we like resumed our conversation. And Aunt Janice goes over and turns this thing on and starts ""practicing,"" except there's only one problem -- it doesn't work really, and she's like practicing away and moving her fingers all around, but there's no sound. There's only a tap, tap, tap, tap. And it's like, what in the world? I guess we know where that came from. And then I woke up and I went back to sleep and I dreamt, I kind of like resumed the dream. I dreamt that we were still in the same house and that I had to get Mom's boombox out of the attic. This house was like some modern house downstairs, but it was our upstairs. So I got Mom's boombox out of the attic, and somehow I had the notion that the people's keyboard wouldn't work because the record key on Mom's boombox was broken off. So I was like trying to fix it, but I think ""record"" and ""play"" were like attached together somehow and I was trying to figure how to attach it back on so that I could record somebody saying something with the boombox. And I attached it the wrong way first, so I had to like take it off and reattach it. And, you know, that's all I remember at this time. What a shame! I should have done this when I first woke up. Oh well."

And Mom and Dad were there to pick me up at the Washington Dulles Airport, and they told me that they had moved our house into Washington, DC for the time that I was on the trip, so that I wouldn't have to fly from Washington, DC to Eastport. And that was really bizarre, and I had the notion that our house had like shrunk or something. And anyway, I realized it was the same-sized house, but I could not fathom why they would move it into Washington, DC when I was on the trip. I also dreamt that we were watching this mermaid movie that had this different story to it. It's all the basic same thing except they say that they're looking and looking all over everywhere, and it kind of takes a twist like Pocahontas because they think Eric kidnapped her and they see her and Eric really love each other and somebody yells that Eric's trying to rape her. And she like, they're all like running after him, trying to get him, and she stops them, actually similar to Pocahontas. And there were these like statues that were drawn on the back of the movie box. One was Triton holding one of the Mermaid's sisters. Another one was Eric at the ship, and the other two I don't remember. Hmmm."

But the second verse was just altogether missing for some reason, and I couldn't figure out why. And then I said, ""Okay, that's enough of this,"" and I was closing out the Little Performer, but when I went to close out the whole thing, these windows kept popping up, and I really couldn't, and it was like a maze trying to get out of it. And then there was something that went wrong, and just about in the middle of all that mess I woke up. Phew!"

I remember there was a really scary part about them telling us what they wanted to do, but I don't remember it. And then I remember that after we put the candles out, I went down and I locked the front door. And then I went to come upstairs and look for Sandra, and I told her I didn't really feel safe until I locked the front door.

But I couldn't find the right connection for the receiver and the X (?) alarm wouldn't go in right, and I turned it on and I had the fader all the way down, but I turned it on and it made the loudest squeal of feedback I've ever heard in my life. And I dreamt that I was trying to connect these two quarter-inch connectors to the board, but they were all dirty and acidy and stuff, and I was wishing I had some of that spray that Connor had, because I think I had dropped them in the dirt or something like that.

I dreamt that we were at a carnival thing like in somebody's parking lot, like and it was almost dusk and we were riding these rides. There were only a few of them. I can't remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it's too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason Dad had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I don't know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task ____ board is on my desk now, but here's, Mom gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boombox. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, isn't it? [laugh] Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, ""Do not enter, surprise things."" And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don't remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, ""Oh man!"" But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like [sings a little song] ""______ in the song I sing today. You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a ______ of my slumber.

And then I sort of dreamt that I was seeing red and signs with red writing and I was hearing the first two notes of ""Bluebird"" repeated over and over and over, kind of at a fast tempo. And I was seeing all this red, and It was really scary. And I was sort of somewhat conscious to know that I was in my room, but I was seeing all this red. And then next thing I know I hear Dad's voice, and he said, well first, then I dreamt that the radio was on and it was playing this song from 94.1. Again I was conscious that I was in my room. And I heard, there was this one jazz song called ""Turn Off the Light"" and Dad was there and he was saying, ""When you hear this song, sing lilacs and lilacs, because if you sing, ""Turn Off the Light"" at night, it'll make you think of dark and you'll be scared.

And then I would kind of elbow him off and pretend to punch him or something, and he would just, he would not give up, no matter what. He was a pretend fighter. And I was in the yard, and I didn't want him to get me, so I went in the garage and I closed the door, and I was in there with the chickens for a while.

We were sitting around on the picnic table listening to some rap song on the garage outside system that we used to have. And we were like writing songs and stuff for this band, and I was like ready to play the drums [laugh] on the picnic table. And I don't know, but some time before that I was working in the kitchen and I lost my thumb, my left thumb got just sliced off by a knife, and it didn't hurt me too bad or anything.

And so they went out scouting around. Well, for some reason the seat came out of the car and was like rolling along on the road, and it turned into like a swing, and I would be able to like fly along the road because of it.

And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers -- one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback. [laugh] Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens! [laugh] So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD/ tape player and they gave me a Spice Girls tape [laugh] . And so we got home and Dad and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it's like an interface with DP. That's bizarre!

But instead they were looking at the digital performer program and how it's set up. And so they did most of the work. They took the rig down and set it up over there in their little sound booth, which was more like a café-style box seat right over the stage, which there were a few spectators in, but there was mostly us. And I made sure I sat the closest to them so I could help them should anything go wrong. And we were all supposed to kind of help each other and do it, but the guy and his 7-year-old daughter did most of it, and I did more watching the play than helping them. And I was looking, from this box seat I could see everything that was going on on the stage, and I could see out into the seats, and I was thinking how Mom and Dad would be looking up at me in the assistant sound technician seat, but I really I did more watching the play than helping them. They didn't really want me to help; they just wanted to use my equipment, so I sat there staring out into space and glancing down at the play every so often. I can't remember anything more.

I couldn't remember if I was singing ""Brahms Lullaby"" or ""La La Loo."" But then I was at school and I was in English class, but first I was waiting to get into English class and there was like this thing in the hallway that was like a steering wheel. It was green and it would say if you turn it, the alarm will sound. So I had to get away from that one. The college rep person was there and a few other students were there following me to English class because they needed to get there too. And there was like, I told them I'm usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about the State University and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, ""If you drop out, we'll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we'll still give it back to you."" And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was [laugh] -- well, this is the funny part -- while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo. It was all kind of funny. And then I started fading into consciousness and I was thinking of those things, and I realized I was laying on my back with my arms above my head, and then I woke up."
"B-180"	"#B-180 (2002-10-07 (17)) We were on a boat, and while we were going to this boat show, we were walking along the dock. And we met this guy who had a boat who was really, really friendly. He ended up taking us on his boat because he was impressed with all I knew about sound and stuff, but I don't remember too much about that. But I remember that I got out and I start swimming and there was another boat close by and it was just sort of anchored out. And then I couldn't really help it, I was right at the stern and something just cut my leg like crazy, I think how the propeller does. It wasn't stinging, but the edges were real sharp like a knife, and it just cut up my leg like crazy. But then when I came back into the guy's boat all I had was one little scrape, so I don't know what that was all about. The next thing I knew, we were on land and we were back at the house and trying to, Dad thought we had such a good time, he wanted this, we still had one in our dream, and he wanted to get ours insured and give it a name so that we could. And then I dreamt that we were at this place where 104.7 was sponsoring this ""Friday, Thank God It's Friday"" party. And Mom and I were sitting on these restaurant booth benches, but there was no other side to them. There were these restaurant booth benches with a long table and out in front people would get out and dance and sing and just be real showy like. And there were some people sitting on booths and tables on the other side and a lot of people standing around the edges, and people would come up and dance and all. And everybody was cheering, ""Friday, thank God it's Friday!"" And we were eating some kind of dessert thing, and next thing I know, what should appear in front of me but a keyboard that spanned like six or seven octaves. And it just like appeared in front of me! And Mom said she just laid it in front of me, and I asked her where did she procure it, and she didn't answer me. And I didn't really make a big row thing or anything. All I really could do was smile at her and nod my head, which I think she got the picture because she smiled at me too, I think. And I took her hand and I shook it a little. That's all I really could do. And then next thing I knew, we were in this restaurant, which was adjacent to this party room-like place and it was still there, and we were finishing up and cleaning up some stuff and we were keeping an eye that it was still there. And then Mom went to the bathroom or something and it just disappeared into thin air, and Frieda returned in her place. And Frieda wanted to climb up to the top of this observatory tower with me, and so I started climbing, but I wasn't really into it. We got about half way up and then we turned around. And then I saw myself on TV, and I heard something on the radio that I had the notion was my work, but I don't know. Oh well, then I woke up."

But we cleaning out some stuff, like from Mom's shed, and there was a whole basket of like stuffed animals and stuff from when I was little, and a couple of towels and a couple of little baskets and a couple buckets and, you know, little miscellaneous stuff. And most of it I went through and I said, ""Okay, I want to throw this out and this out and this out. [laugh] But then we came to some stuffed animals and things, and there was this one teddy bear that was really cool. He was sitting in a chair and the chair was covered with a towel. And the towel was like real pretty with like stars and seashells and glittery stuff on it. And I lifted the towel, and it was this talking, singing teddy bear, and he had a keyboard on his lap. And he would like sing songs and play it, and like do like little kids things and stuff. And so anyway, I really thought he was cool and I wanted to keep him for like when we were babysitting. But then when I went to cover him back up with the towel, so nobody would see him, the towel was totally missing. The towel was gone. And I couldn't find it anywhere. It was like it was part of the chair, it was part of the thing. I told you, it was real fancy. And then, since I couldn't find the towel, I sat him in this basket and covered him up with an ordinary towel. And I came in the house for a second -- let me think for a minute -- I think Dad had the TV on and there was one of those parades of things that I used to make when I was real little going around on the floor. And I can't remember what I was doing or where I went or why I went in the house, but I was thinking, ""I have to go out to the picnic table to where I was cleaning out and b___ the teddy bear before somebody throws it out because it's disguised as some other thing. So I can't remember if I did or not. [laugh] Then I woke up. That was strange, man."

It was Mom and Dad and I, and we were supposed to like meet somebody somewhere, I think. And Mom was setting up a little campsite. She was setting up some cooking and some tea and stuff, and Dad and I were going to take this little roller coaster ride type thing, and so we did. We got in line and we sat down on this little two-person roller coaster thing; I was behind him. And we started going and I had forgotten to fasten my safety harness, and I was yelling, ""Wait, wait, wait!"" but it was too late. We were already up in the air, and we like went up in the air off the tracks, and my little seat detached from his and it turned into like a glider, and it would fly how I moved my body and so I kind of flew it with my body. And it was really, really cool. And then we got to this, we were flying across this body of water, this little lake, and we were coming to the dock and I was able to land my little thing right on the dock, which I thought was pretty cool. And so we walked down this little dock bridge path thingy until we got to the little campsite that Mom had set up, and she was like hanging out some wet clothes to dry and cooking up some tea and all. And then I had a second little dream that she had prepared this poster thing, and she had found three or four pictures of Derek with the music major and me like as a little toddler of three years old with a scared look on my face, and then a picture of a guy (?) itself and then a picture of me 17 years old near it with a big smile on my face. I don't know why that keeps coming back to me in my dreams. That is just silly, silly, silly. [laugh]"

And for some reason I was setting these things up in the garbage closet instead of on the porch and I also had my other little c_______s and stuff like that. And I was afraid that if we left the candles in there too long, they were going to start to melt down and set things on fire. And so I took them out, and I just took everything out for the time being. And then next thing I knew, we were up on the roof doing a play about some Halloween characters. We were like acting it out, and I was just like a spectator watching all of this. It was Mrs. Dougherty's class I realized, and she was like sitting perched in a tree a few feet away watching us as well. This was in front of my room. Part of the roof in front of Mom's room, we heard Al Jerot playing on a tape player and we heard people singing. And Mrs. Dougherty said, ""Wait a second. My class is supposed to be up here."" And so she kind of got out of the tree and walked over there and saw that it was Mr. Girard's class over there, which really this was switched around because our class should have been doing the singing and his class should have been doing the acting. So then she comes back from talking to him and says, ""My class over here."" And she has us climb out onto the tree and down, and then we're like running around our back yard, which is like four times bigger than it usually is. I think this is going to auto-reverse. I can't believe this thing can't even auto-reverse on its own any more. I have to help it along. But anyway, [laugh] that was the basic point of that. Then we were just running around and playing around. Oh, I know, this group of girls said, ""Jasmine is so good. She only talks to her boyfriend and to her mother."" And we were like holding hands and saying little crazy stuff like that. And that's all."

And I had the notion that they were going to serve us lunch and I had to get down there in time for lunch, but the elevator was doing some crazy stuff. And we stopped at one of these floors where they had this like little sitting area, and I dreamt that we were, then all of a sudden, juxtaposed, I was at home with the monitor reading this children's book that was like a variation of Little Mermaid. I keep having dreams about the Little Mermaid having slightly different details to the story, like this time I dreamt that instead of Eric being saved from drowning, for some reason Ariel needed CPR, and in order to break Ursula's spell, instead of kissing her, Eric had to give her two breaths of human breathing so Ariel could stay a human forever instead of a kid. Now that was rats, man! [laugh]"

And then all of a sudden I was at home working on DP. I was editing a file that had some variation in it as to what was going on and what was going to happen at the party. And I didn't really want Dad to hear it, so I kind of like tried to close it out real fast before it actually opened, and it got all screwed up. And then I woke up. [laugh] Hmmm."

I was kind of trying not to touch the bottom with my feet, thinking there was a pool cleaner roaming around, which a lot of time is what I do anyway. I try to grab the side because I don't want to reach down and find anything buried down there. So then we got out and we were walking around the side and there was this kids' slide that had stairs leading up to it, and then the person would like slide through the puddle and then out and down the slide. And there was this pail of plastic potato chips that really smelled real with a shovel and a couple other play things that kids could play with. And then I went inside this like club-like type place and the lady said that she does birthday parties and things, and I gave her my card and said, ""Call me if you ever need a DJ."" And then I dreamt that I was home and Mom was telling me this big secret, that there was something that she had that was really secret and not to ever use it until her and Dad went out of town. But I don't remember what it was, but it was something small and electronic like a camera or a cell phone, or maybe she was referring to the mini disc recorder, I don't know. But then her and I were dancing around in the living room because we were so happy about something; I don't remember what. And let's see, and then when Mom and Dad came back from being out of town, Mom confided in me that the car had automatic horns, whatever that is! [laugh] And that would mean that whenever somebody's singing in the car and they hold a long chromate at the end, the horn will start honking after you're through! [laugh] That was crazy, man! "

Then I had this notion that I had to go out to get something; I don't remember where it was or what I had to do, but I had to go somewhere. So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to know. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I don't remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I don't look like I'm of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this ____ thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn -- that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I didn't want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boombox out on the front lawn and played some CD's and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up."

And at the end the presenters asked for comments, and nobody but two people gave comments. And then when I was walking up to get the newspaper at 24th Avenue and 7th Street, I was still carrying the mini disc recorder and the straight ___ microphone in my other hand to get any kind of other sounds I could, and I saw Mrs. Dougherty at the corner there when I was getting the paper and she said, ""No wonder no more people made comments. You had that thing!"" Oh, I know, I left it like in the grass the next block away, and then I went up to see her and then she said that.

And so we stopped the car and we got out, and we went over, we started walking around and they, this guy was giving out big candy trunks, candy bar-like trunks in this box, and I took a big chocolate one. It was just kind of like the size of a rock. And I took a bit of it, and before I knew it, it turned into like a chocolate walking stick, so I was walking around with it. And then Dad thought that would be too dangerous, so he took it. And we walked around the park and we were listening to the songs, and Mom was kind of miffed because he didn't sit down and pay attention to her. He was walking around and listening to the concert with me. And then I just remembered something else. Before all this, there was another part of the dream, that we were at Westport High School and Mrs. Dougherty was holding a Christmas concert in the little theater. And we were invited and her chorus was going to put it on. And I was thinking that I would finally hear something from her chorus.

And it was all real fully lit and they had a sound system down there so people could dance and sing. And I remember dancing and taking the microphone and singing something, but I don't remember what. And then I remember this boy got up there and did the same thing ______________. And we were all taking our turn and doing our things.

And it had some flashing lights on the railing like emergency vehicles have. And Mom took me down there and she was showing me how to turn on the other lights. See, what people did when they went down into the cellar, okay, so what a person would do when they'd go down in this cellar, is they would turn on the big lights before they turned off the small lights, because if they turned off the small lights first, they would be in total darkness. And I was trying to tell Mom -- she like had me on her shoulder -- I was trying to tell her to turn on the other lights before she showed me how to turn off the small lights, but she didn't listen to me and we turned off the small lights and we were in total darkness.

"B-199"	"#B-199 (2002-11-27 (17)) I was at school and I can't remember what in the world we were doing and why I was there, but I had the notion that I was at Bancroft Middle School. And I also, then I suddenly dreamt that I was at this like outdoor sound studio under this little walkway, and I was at the sound board adjusting levels and stuff, and doing a test-test-one-two-three kind of a thing. And there were a couple of people on the other side, and I was recording all this on a mini disc. And then I dreamt that it was starting to rain and we had to get the board inside, a little shelf thing was taking on water. The two engineers and I kept dumping it as we went. And I know there was more of a connection; I just can't remember it. It's so frustrating."
"B-200"	"#B-200 (2002-12-04 (17)) I was at a party at a three-story house. It was kind of a big house. I had a notion that it was the Richardses that were hosting it, but I didn't know who was hosting it. And there were like these tables around with these snack things. There were like two or three bowls of snacks at each table. And there was a pool at this house. And there was like this man. We were on the second floor and we were on a balcony overlooking the pool and this man was like giving us very specific instructions about how to open bags of snacks and serve them, and when to put more out and when to leave the bowls empty, and not to put too much out. And on further analysis, I think this man must have been Mace, Barbara's husband, because when they sent us our invitation, they gave us real specific instructions as to when to come, where to park, don't bring a gift, and please let other people sit down and eat when you're done, and all kinds of stuff like that. So I think that's where that came from. Also something very strange -- the past two times I have dreamt about hearing the ""Wee Sing"" tape, I've been really, really scared and wanting to cling to Mom when ""Bluebird"" is about to come on. I stopped having dreams like that a while ago, and whenever I would dream about the tape, it wouldn't be scary. But now I'm starting to be scared when I have those dreams, but not when I wake up, just in the dream. So I dreamt that all of a sudden we were in this bedroom at the house and the tape was playing and ""London Bridge"" was on, and Mom was going to do something, she was going to fill up more bowls of snacks. And ""Bluebird"" came on and I just clung to her and I was like, ""Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God"" and I was ready to start crying and things. And then I slowly faded into consciousness and I woke up. I don't know what all that's about. But at least the good news is, is I don't wake up really scared like I used to. I just wake up and it's over, and I think about it and go, ""Wow!"" That's strange."
"B-201"	"#B-201 (2002-12-06 (17)) Mom and Dad both thought that I wanted a keyboard for Christmas and Mom didn't know the difference between that and the s_______ board. And Dad [laugh] -- this is kind of funny -- Dad found this like multi-track recorder that would record like ten minutes of audio and put these different little sounds on triggers, and it was kind of neat, but I don't know, Mom said that it wasn't the one. [laugh] And then Uncle Fred told Mom and Dad what I really wanted. Next thing I knew, it was set up on a little tray like my typing keyboard is in my studio. Well, it was set up on a little tray in the TV cabinet in the living room, between the TV and the amplifier. And when Dad and I were sitting there listening to Celine Dion, I got up from the couch and moved the computer chair over in front of the TV cabinet and I pulled out that little tray, and we were hearing this the way it is, and I was trying to play it along with the CD, which I think it was a horrible job, but I don't know. It was just a dream anyway. And then I stood up and I was going over to Dad to ask him how he thought I did. He was sound asleep. He was snoring away, which I thought it was pretty good because I really didn't want him to see me and hear my anyway. [laugh] Then the next time I sat down was when nobody was in the house, and I thought, ""Okay, I am going to sit down and practice and do a decent job this time."" And I sat down and turned it on and it was not connected to the amplifier any more, so I sat down and started checking it out. The amplifier was as light as a feather, so I just lifted it off the shelf and turned it around and looked at the back of it, and it was nothing like I'm used to seeing when I'm conscious. There were no RCA (?) connections whatsoever. It looked more like the back of the car radio, which is probably because that's what we were kind of doing like a few days ago. And I was trying to find a way to kind of jam some bare wire into some connection so that I could get this connection made and get this thing connected to the amplifier again. And just as I was doing that, I heard Mom and Dad coming home in the car and I had wires and connections and stuff all over the living room. And I didn't want them to see that I had been messing around, so I met Dad at the door and said, ""You can't come in right now, I'm working on a surprise."" And he said, ""Well, just guide me in, I'll close my eyes."" And then I woke up, realized it was all a dream and said he can come in if he wants to. There's no wires and stuff scattered all over everywhere; it's a dream. That was weird."

And for some reason we needed to run this great big hose from the pump outside into the kitchen, and we had to, instead of having the sink spray into the hose to prime the pump, we had to have the hose spray into the sink to prime the sink. And then, after spraying the hose into the sink faucet for a while, we had to spray the hose down into the garbage disposal and run the garbage disposal for a while. And it made the most horrible, horrible sound and it was the most horrible feeling to me. And somehow I had the notion that this had to be done because I like stayed too long at a party and left the sink running while I was gone or something stupid like that. And it made a sound that really scared me, and I was pretty sure, when I think about it now, I'm pretty sure I've heard it somewhere, but I don't know where. So I know there was more to it, but I can't remember now. That was kind of stupid."

So her and I went up the elevator, and the elevator was dark and I kind of lost her in the elevator, and then I proceeded to English class, but it was so late I didn't want to go in without her. So I kind of ducked around down a flight of stairs and I kind of hid in a corner somewhere. And I was kind of like waiting for her, and she never came. And then I somehow made my way out to behind the gym and I was kind of walking back and forth out on the field while the people were having P.E. And then I made my way in into the girls' locker room so I could get out. And I was getting ready to go out the front of the gym when I realized that the doors had Christmas decorations on them and they were all taped shut. They had like artificial pine bows with those crystal angels we saw at Fletchers, and I got tangled in a bunch of wires because they had a TV and a VCR and stuff over there. And I dreamt that I was kind of like really skipping the last period too, so that it would look like I went home. And that's all."

So I'm glad it wasn't any kind of a big audition or anything I had to do. I just hope that tomorrow is a big Christmas surprise for Mom and Dad and I hope I won't have to disappoint the people I've invited. I just have to; there's no way I can back out of tomorrow. Tonight is one thing, but not tomorrow. Anyway, to the point, this is right before Christmas. This happened to me last year. I had a dream last night that, well, I dreamt that I had to get up and go take my exam early in the morning, which I did that day. And I dreamt that I had some last minute audio editing to do on DP, and so I sat down and, first of all, the colors on the contrast were like all messed up and I like opened up one of those set up pages, you know how they go. I was having Mom read things off to me and I wasn't making sense of it, and I was getting more and more confused and I kept losing the cursor, as I often do. And I finally said, ""Okay, I'm shutting down and I'm getting out of here."" So I closed it down and set it down, and next thing I know, I'm at school and Mom's a little late and I'm racing to get to Mr. Perry's class on time because I dreamt that it was his exam I had to take. And what the material of his exam was going to consist of was reacting appropriately to a fire drill. And we were racing to get to his class before the alarm class, and we didn't make it. It went off while we were in the hall, and, you know, sound, acoustics-wise, the hall is the worst place you could be when the fire alarm goes off. Then I don't remember too much more, and then I woke up."
"B-205"	"#B-205 (2002-12-24 (17)) First of all, there was this thing that you could record video and audio while you're sleeping, and it looked just like my mini disc recorder. And I asked Mom to show it to me and how it worked because I was curious. And, like I said, the main unit looks just like my mini disc recorder, and there's this magnet that connects to it, and you have to put the magnet on the front of your good foot. And you have to like put this little candle thing on your shoulder. And then you have to take this microphone thing and wrap it around in a coil sixteen times, and let it sit on the bed next to you. And I said, ""Well, isn't this going to be obvious to whoever you're sleeping with?"" And she was like, ""Well, the whole purpose of it is to catch somebody who's not sleeping with you, like ____ and his girl coming walking into the bedroom, you could record them. And how about strange! And I dreamt that I was all mixed up on the calendar, like yesterday was the day before Christmas Eve, and really in my dream I thought it was the day before Christmas Eve, but it was really like a week before.

And I was in Health class, and we had this substitute that was just, she's a black woman and she was just sitting back and letting the kids run wild. And Dad got so mad about that, he was going to call the school and everything and do everything he could to get her fired. And I said to myself, ""I'm never having him come into school again."" And then I dreamt that the school had this like system of boardwalks and planks and exits and levels and stuff, and I wanted to get to the very tippy top. And I can't remember exactly, but I told Dad I would meet him at 2:00 o'clock, and I was like walking around these different places and things, and I came down this dive ramp thing, I like walked down it and I was in the water. Dad was right there at the bottom of it, talking to somebody, and I like waded around in the water until it was time. And then I dreamt that I was at home and involved with concert information from Mrs. Dougherty. And I was just going to take it to the monitor and read it, and then I woke up."
"B-207"	"#B-207 (2002-12-27 (17)) There was this lady, one of my teachers, I guess -- who had this box of CD's and she wanted me to go through them and pick out a few of them that I wanted. So I went through them and they all looked kind of blah except for these two. They were both done by Celine Dion. One was called ""The Little Green Captains"" and it was like a real cartoony cover. But I had the notion that it was one of Celine Dion's first albums, so I picked that one out. And there was another called ""The Swedes"" -- you know, like people from Sweden, the Swedes. And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else. And the rich guy was kind of left hanging, and the servant girl ended up marrying the rich guy and got out of being a servant, which is what she wanted. And there were, this CD, this story was told in songs on this CD. And I had this like baby CD player in my closet that I was playing this CD on, and it was light blue and it had like red buttons on it. And it was like for babies. And I'm in my closet listening to this, with my door closed, and Mom needed me to come downstairs for something, and then I woke up. But that was kind of cool. You know, maybe she will play in a movie. Singers who like go and act, I think they kind of get distracted from their singing. So it's good that she never tried to act."
"B-208"	"#B-208 (2002-12-30 (17)) We were having some people over, and this girl who was sitting next to me -- oh no, it wasn't just one girl, it was three or four kids my own age who wanted me to show them my sound equipment. Oh, I know what it was now! I had set up, well, first of all, I dreamt that all of my sound equipment resided on the computer desk downstairs and that the PC was really the Mac that ran this little performer, and it was all down there. And I had set it up in just a certain way, and there were these three or four people who wanted to see it, how it worked. And all of a sudden the three or four people dwindled down to one girl, and so I explained the difference between the two mixers -- the Peavey and the task cam -- but in my dream they were both black. Then this girl turns on the computer and she's waiting for it to start up, and she doesn't see a desktop right away and she gets a little alarmed, like, ""Hey! Where does this reside in the..."" and then she was like, ""This program, Digital Performer you're talking about, where does it reside?"" And I was like, ""Just be patient; it will come up."" And so when it came up, the desktop was green and I showed her the icon as to where to go and stuff, and I don't remember too much about what she saw when she got in the program or what her reaction to it was. But I do remember all of a sudden there were a ton of people, like Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and a bunch of other family people and a bunch of the Fire Department people. And all of a sudden they wanted me to sing for them, so I go up and I start warming up. Now, you know that when I set up my equipment, I know at least a day in advance so I have a whole half an hour to set it up, to get ready to be amplified on the system. Well, I just wanted to have some accompaniment this time, and I had some stuff started on the CD RW, but my CD recorder is the only one that'll play CD RW's, so I was really in a rock and a hard place because what I was fixing to do was record it onto a tape and play the tape on Mom's boombox while I sang along and not involve the sound system this time, which is what I did, and I came downstairs with the boombox and I set it up, and all the people were gone. There was only like one person and Dad in the living room. And Dad was like, ""You'd better go out there and yell to them. They're all in their cars."" And so I went out there, and I yelled, ""Hey, you guys!"" And they were all gone. But the bird was just going nuts, screeching and screeching and screeching. So I yelled at him, I was going, ""Hey, birdie, stop!"" And at that point some car honked its horn. It had a really funny sound to it. And then I went back inside, and I figured, ""Well, that's a wash. That was a lot of work for nothing."" And even the girl was gone, who was supposedly looking at Digital Performer. And so I went upstairs and I was arranging some stuff back to the way it was, and I realized that I had left the sub on from the last time I had the sound system on, and you know how they require more power and so they have their own amplifiers. So you gotta click the switch on and off, so I forgot to click the switch off and I could hear that it had a little bit of chubba chubba chubba chubba sound, which meant there was an internal cooling fan cooling it off. And so I figured I'll shut it off so it'll quit getting hot and it'll cool itself off. So I reach down, I clicked the switch off, but when I did that, its fan like kicked in full force and it blew all this warm air out at me, and I was like so spooked by that and I ran out of my studio with a yell! And [laugh] that was funny! And I was still spooked and I jumped up on my bed, and I set my hand down and there was a moth ball under my covers, but I got so scared, I thought it was either a mouse or something. So I screamed again. [laugh] And Dad was like, ""Are you alright?"" And then I woke up. [laugh] That was crazy, man."

And I had to have this test in History or something, and she still lived at the school, so in my dream she was having a hard time finding a place to go and read the test to me. And I told her there's two conference rooms in the library, so we went in the library and we sat down and she started writing out the test bigger on another paper. And she was telling me how concerned she is that I won't make it along in life. Now I know she doesn't really feel that way, but in my dream she did. And finally I woke up.

And there's this -- as we were singing it -- there's this part that goes, ""Ticka ticka too, ticka ticka too, ticka ticka too"" and for some reason I got scared and I started grabbing people, anybody I could find. And Melinda was there; I think I grabbed her. And I had this basket of Easter candy I was trying to keep track of, and I was dropping things out of it. This was around Easter time anyway.

He started yelling at Mom for something and then he started walking away. And I picked up a cinder block that was sitting in the sand and I threw it at him, but I didn't hit him fortunately. [laugh] And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn't hit us, fortunately. [laugh] That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn't scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that Mom's Bose wave radio CD and her boombox both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA's and the boombox needed C's, like it's always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, ""Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"" sound instead of your audio. And you'd think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you'd think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no! So I dealt with that for a while, and in my dream it was scary, and so I was thinking up all kinds of ways to tape the -- the thing of it is, I don't think the boombox had a door to keep them in and so they would fall out.

[laugh] And so we were at the beach and I was going to have the baby in the salt water to make things a lot easier and to make it so I wouldn't have to go through so much pain of labor and stuff. And I started having the baby and the head popped out, and I was asking Mom, ""Does my body naturally push or do I have to act like I'm going poop?"" And she said, ""It naturally happens,"" and the baby was starting to come out and we were going out deeper and deeper into the water. And then when the baby's body started coming out, it was like really, really painful and Mom was like lifting me up to the top of the water and putting me down in the water, and lifting me out of the water and putting me down in the water, thinking that it might shake the baby out. [laugh] And then the baby came out and fell down to the bottom of the water and was going to drown, so we pulled it out real quick and we raced up to the shore.

And there were these clowns and things running around, and we got out and showered off like nothing happened, and then we were going back to the water.

And then I think there was more, but I think I just faded into consciousness after that."

And she was a foreigner to the others, of course, and we had two white chickens in this dream. So two white chickens and a red one, plus the black one that we found. And the black one was a foreigner to the others, so they would always shoo the black one away. And I had to distract the others and feed the black one. And she wasn't real tame and we had to tame her and like hold her and talk to her to get her to like us better. And I don't think we've ever had a black chicken. And then I dreamt that I was keeping up with Mrs. Hollander and her AP test, and I dreamt that she had totally no confidence in me, that I was going to do well at all in my AP test. She just totally thought I was going to not pass. And she wanted me to come in when she gives her class a practice test, and she wanted me to take it. And I was so nervous because I didn't want her to have my head if I didn't pass the AP test. And then I woke up."
"B-222"	"#B-222 (2003-01-26 (17)) This is the most bizarre dream I've had in a while. I dreamt that there like these friends that I had over at the house. There were like three or four of them. They were kind of okay at first, but then they kind of didn't want anything to do with me. And somehow I had the notion that we had a fire alarm system in the house, and that Dad and I were sitting out in the back yard reading or something and they were in the kitchen helping Mom bake a pie. And somehow they knew they knew that she was going to burn something in the oven and that it was going to go off, so they came out of the house and they got in back of the truck, in the bed of the truck, and I was like, ""What are you guys doing in here?"" And they were like, ""I don't know; we don't want to tell you."" And I kind of figured that it was probably going to go off so I climbed in the back with them, and there was just enough room for me to like lay down. And it was real greasy and kind of dirty back there. And Dad got in the cab of the truck and started it up and drove us away, and drove us around the block a few times. And then I dreamt that somebody was getting married and we had to go see them get married, and that they were going to like walk down the street any minute with their stuff. And one other thing -- I dreamt that I was looking through this book of biographies on techno singers, and I was looking for the girl who sings, ""Come Into My Planet Soul."" I can't sing at this hour of the morning! [laugh] And I couldn't find her, and then I think I woke up."

I just threw them in my purse because I didn't have the lunch bag thing that they gave me any more. And I was going to sit down at the gorge (?) and edit some stuff I had recorded with him, and so, and also Mom was going to make this soup, and I told her rather than make it before we go and have to wait, why doesn't she take the stuff over and make it in the little kitchen there and make enough for everybody. So she did. She took the ramen noodles and she took some other vegetables and things, and we went to the radio station and I was there with Dick, and I don't really remember doing too much editing. But I do remember her making the soup and stuff."
"B-224"	"#B-224 (2003-02-01 (17)) I had another song to learn for chorus, and Mom was helping me learn it, and she was like reading the music for me and I would play the notes on the music measure. And then I would sing them, you know how you do when you're learning a song and you sight read it. Well, it was pretty different. It had several more octaves and the on-off keys and all like that were to the right instead of to the left. And I dreamt that after we were done -- well actually, I dreamt that we kept getting interrupted by phone calls and requests from Dad and people coming over. And we were moving around all over the house. And [laugh, sigh] I was kind of, you know, I don't know. [laugh] What the heck?! Finally when we were done, I dreamt that Mom like stashed it away in her work room."

He was really doing a lot of stuff with the City, but I dreamt that he was training these actors and actresses and he was part of the scenery. And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn't want to tell because he said he's sworn to secrecy and he doesn't want the word to get out. And I was thinking, ""Man, that's a show that I really like, and I never knew that my dad was part of it until now?"" And let's see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marilou and a couple other people. And I think I was in a hurry to get home because I knew Mrs. Dougherty was coming over, so then I tell him I'm going to break away from the crowd and I start running. And I'm almost home, and then I woke up."
"B-226"	"#B-226 (2003-02-01 (17)) Mom and I, when I was sight reading, that we kept getting interrupted because the first time I tested it out, it took me a while to hem and haw and get over the heebie jeebies and stuff, and finally admit to myself that it's okay to be a little kind of cheesy and all, and so, but that day when I was doing that for the first time back in June, Mom and Dad had gone, were going to go to a movie, which they did, but Dad left to go do an errand real quick. And Mom thought that she was too late and that he had left for the theater without her, and so she got on her bike and rode down to the theater. And then Dad came home and wondered where she went and I told him that she had gone to the theater, and so they said that they would meet up. So then when he left, I was reasonably sure that it was safe, and I took it out after some hemming and hawing and all that, and it was sitting on its -- oh, I get so tongue-tied! -- anyway, it was sitting on the bed in all its glory when first the phone rings. It's Mom calling from a pay phone to say that she hadn't seen Dad yet. Then I hang up the phone and I go back to what I'm doing, and then the phone rings again like two minutes later, and it's Dad to say that he met up with Mom. So then I go back to my business, and while I'm talking on the phone, I'm just hoping that nobody's going to come to the door. [laugh] And let's see, oh yeah, and then I go back to business, and then Quinn calls! And I'm like, ""Jiminy Christmas, when are these phone calls going to leave me alone!?"" [laugh] And another funny thing that happened is I took care of that and I set it aside. I put it back in its box and I went to set up the sound system for Dad's party that was going to happen that night, and I was done, and so I figured, ""Well, I've got an extra hour before they're supposed to come home. I can go learn some more songs."" And so I took it out again, I set it up, and so I'm learning, ""My Heart Will Go On"" by ear, and I'm chipping and chipping away at way, screwing up here and messing up there, making a terrible total mess of it, but having fun. And next thing I know, what do I hear but the truck, and remember how those keys to turn it on and off are so difficult, and you can't do it with the wrong kind of touch. You can't do it with nervous fingers. And, of course, I was like, ""Ahhhhhh, oh, my gosh!"" And I finally was able to turn it off and saw the LED's go dark, and I shoved it back in its box so fast, and I shoved the box back in its corner. I raced down to meet them, trying to be as calm as I can, [sigh] -- that was some ordeal! But, you know, Mom found out anyway because, first of all, I couldn't keep it from her too long. You know, I tell her everything. And second of all, the box is right by the phone and so when I put the box back, it sat on top of the phone cord, and she knew that I'd been handling it."

I dreamt that Mom was sleeping in bed with me, which she does a lot, but that she was playing the ""La La Loo"" tape, and it was okay, I wasn't scared or anything because I dreamt that the real song that would scare me would be, I think it was, ""Stra la la, stra la la,"" and some other kind of German or Russian words.

I dreamt that I didn't understand natural logarithms at all, and whenever, and my calculator would act up too, and whenever I would enter in a natural logarithm, it would go, ""Error function"" and it would do something really screwy. And I think because of that, Melinda was trying to get me back into Ms. Forrest's class, who was my teacher last year, first semester. She wanted me to just be there while Ms. Forrest was reviewing something. But in order to be in Ms. Forrest's class I had to skip Ms. Marcos's class. That was just a dumb dream about math!"

Okay, anyway, we had this salad bar set up and it was kind of, I don't know why it put me to mind to a sound board except it had faders on the front, and the salad went where all the rest of the pots would normally go. And Dad was trying to get me to do a mathematical problem to see if people would get more salad if they divided it up evenly, or if people just went up there and just got however much they wanted. That was kind of dumb. I know there was more to it. Lately I've been real bad about not putting my dreams on the tape when I first wake up because that's the best time. I say, ""Oh, I'll do it when I wake up more and my voice sounds a little better,"" but then I forget and then it's like blah. So even if I sound half asleep, I should do it and capture everything I can, and I'll wake up as I go."

And I was climbing on these trees, and there were these ducks and seagulls, and it seems nobody ever fed them because they were so hungry. And these pigeons were just so tame. One just sat on my shoulder the whole time until I could get him some bread. And there was this bird bread I was giving them and they were just all over me. And then I dreamt that we got back in the car and we went to this beach. I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, but I'm not sure. I do remember, however, that I had to sing at this beach for some reason, and I was trying to figure out how was my voice going to be able to soar above the roar of the sea.

Well, that's what they were doing, but they winged her, they lifted her all the way up to the mezzanine of this auditorium where there was this huge knight statue with big arms, and just let her hang in front of this knight for a while, and she was still singing. I can't imagine how somebody can sing being hung from a thing like that. They must have the words already and lip sync it because you just can't sing unless you're on your two feet.

And Melinda and this boy sat down and they were like listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn't want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using -- not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Melinda kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, ""Why don't you just use one finger?"" And I was like, ""Because two fingers is more precise for me."" And about that time I woke up."
"B-248"	"#B-248 (2003-03-16 (17)) My graduation party was in a week already, and that I was in there kind of inspecting and looking around to see how the tables and stuff were. And they had this like, they had made up a long head table, but it didn't seem they had put any table cloth on it yet, and it was this blue table that could seat three. And then they inter_____ these little square tables that can seat four. They put a blue one and two yellow ones together. So as a total, it could seat eight people. Well I thought that we could get more chairs if we took the yellow table and moved it over to the side, and we put Jeff and Nikki and Bart and Quinn over there, and then we could seat -- one, two, three, four, five, six -- we could seat six at our little table that we had joined and then we could have a total of ten seats. [laugh] That was kind of odd. And then we went up to this, oh, and in this ballroom they had like couches around the perimeter for some reason. And then in the, we were up at the counter and they gave us our, all the food for the buffet to take home so that we could keep it cold. That was strange."
"B-249"	"#B-249 (2003-03-17 (17)) We were looking in somebody's fundraiser catalog and there was all this kind of junky, expensive stuff. And but there was this one thing -- there was this Easter bunny, there was this karaoke Easter bunny that sang popular songs and I just thought that was the coolest thing, so we had to get it. But we had to order it online, so we went to this crazy website and we finally found it, and we ordered it. And then, then another dream, I guess, but it seemed contiguous to me. All of a sudden we were going to meet the chorus at Countryside High for that competition thing, and we were sitting in a car for whatever reason, and we were almost late. And there was another school parading past us. We didn't want to jump in their line and screw up their order. So we waited until they went by and then we raced up to our warm up room to find out that I didn't have my black shoes. I had my white shoes. And Mom was saying that Josie probably had some. I had the notion that she was there. And then they said, ""Just don't worry about it."" This was the wrong day anyway. We were supposed to come on a different day. And then another dream, I dreamt that there was this TV commercial advertising like a Frankenstein series of like shows, like Jag. And it showed Madonna talking to Victor, and she said, almost like a kid playing -- first she said, ""There's something I know you know how to do, so let's do it."" And at that she like, she created another person, I think. And it was like, ""Whoa!"" And oh yeah, then a little transient dream I had was there was an empty vitamin bottle [laugh] and Mom wanted me to put it outside for the chickens, and she said, ""Let's give the chickens a nothing treat!"" [laugh] And then I said, ""Okay, let's give the chickens a nothing treat,"" so and I was getting ready to put it outside, but then I realized it still had half my vitamins in it so I put it back in the fridge. That was stupid! And then I woke up."

Well, I find out that Samantha has a dog and she's just giving my white chocolate bunnies to the dog like dog food treats. And I was so mad because those were supposed to be for us to eat, and here she's giving them to a dog! And here I paid $7 for those suckers. [laugh] And I can't remember too much more."
"B-251"	"#B-251 (2003-03-22 (17)) We had this black chicken who was kind of learning a little bit about how to be tame with people, and kind of watching what the white chicken and the red chicken were doing. And one day they saw the chickens jumping up on me, like they do, and being friendly and wanting food. Well, this black chicken decides she's going to jump from the nest onto my arm, and hang onto my shoulder. And this chicken was so heavy, I thought I was going to die. Actually what it was, was she was perched on my arm and trying to hang on by gripping my shirt with her feet on my shoulder. And I don't know why, but I could barely hold up this chicken's weight, and so I kind of had to put her down. And then I dreamt that Serena was coming by to bring us something and she had a portable radio and she was kind of using it like a cell phone to dial toll-free numbers. I can't remember anything else; I know there was more."

"B-253"	"#B-253 (2003-03-23 (17)) I was at the stadium with Joshua (?) and I was doing a bunch of stuff, and I was traversing the, well, first I was up in the control room with him and I had to go down to the desk to get some papers for him. And then I think I was going to go, but some lady gave me a graduation pencil and I forgot it, so I went back up there and I had my cane because there were so many steps and so many odd things, and nobody really seemed to ______ out any different, I just kind of found my way around. And there was this one set of steps that you had to down like a ladder, and I was glad that I had it, because if I didn't, I would have just went ""splat"" off the edge. [laugh] And then I made my way down and for some reason I had the notion that the audio control room was outside and down a little path, and down some more steps and down next to the water, where like a fishing deck would be. And that was kind of cool."

But some people said that they just don't go to the beach, so we didn't, and we were all kind of sitting around the table kind of deciding what we were going to do. And we decided to go scuba diving, and so we kind of stayed on the dock, Mom and Dad and I, while the kids actually went in the boat and scuba dived. They were like anchored and they didn't really scuba dive at all. They just kind of jumped in the water. [laugh] So what the thing was, is you had to jump off backwards off the ship, meaning you had to stand on the back of the ship and face the ship and then jump off without facing the water. That was pretty odd. And also, I think at the same time, they were doing some kind of concert where they had these like mini synthesized accompaniments and various people were coming up to sing. Well, you know Dad and his control factor, he went over and he put on this one song that he liked, and nobody went up to sing to it. He just let it play. [laugh] That was strange. I know there was more, but I can't remember it."
"B-255"	"#B-255 (2003-03-29 (18)) My birthday. I had a kind of a strange dream last night. I dreamt that I was in the summer transition program for Wilcox Center and it was more like being at _______. Me and three other students were in this room and there was this big, huge synthesizer mixer board. It looks like a huge version of my Tascan (?) board, but it was this guy that was the instructor and he was showing us about how, he was showing us with an organ p____ sound and he wanted to change it, but he couldn't get any ______. And so when this other guy came in with another student, he asked the student to show him. And you had to mix automation and change it. Then I dreamt that we were in the car with Bonnie and Josie and Bobby and they were all kind of, you know how they're all kind of complainers. Well, for some reason Josie gave me a thing of milk and said, ""Here, take this so we won't have to wrap it."" And they took us home and then we were home and then I woke up."
"B-256"	"#B-256 (2003-04-01 (18)) We were at this Great Explorations exhibit or some kind of fair thing, but it was inside. And there were all these various things, and there was an area that said ""Teachers,"" but it should have been ""Singers,"" because they had a Sha_____ display, they had a A______ display, they had a Celine Dion display and they had a bunch of other displays, and there were a few rides and a few little movie things going on. And I was there with Mom. Before they showed the exhibit -- I can't remember what it looked like, though -- and we saw the Celine Dion exhibit -- well, actually the Shaday exhibit was kind of elegant, kind of nice. The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout ch____ plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song _______ would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we hadn't gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, ""Teacher's Exit"" and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So we, ______ like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we're running around and we don't know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher's exit, I tell Mom, ""Open the door and run out,"" but she doesn't. We just run out the back door to avoid all that, and I think she gets it under control before it really turns into anything major. And then I woke up."
"B-257"	"#B-257 (2003-04-04 (18)) I was going to my birthday party and it was going to be a place that looks like Morrison Park's Club Saturday dance room, and so the plan was that I was supposed to enter real slowly with a wireless microphone in my hand and give a little speech and sing ""Happy Birthday"" to myself, like I'm going to do at my graduation, kind of like. But I forgot all about the plan and I run in there because I want to be involved on the party, and I have this notion that I'm late to the party. And so I get in there and I start partying and dancing and stuff, and then I get up by the sound table and I'm ready to sing ""Happy Birthday"" and Dad goes over to the sound board and starts screwing up the levels, so that I'm way low and the music is way high. And then I go over there and I'm like, ""Hey, what the heck are you doing?"" And I'm like trying to readjust it and having to justify why. And I dreamt that the CD player had two separate outputs for its two separate trays, and that we had to mix on the mixer so that the right hand try would be on the right channel only, and the left hand tray would be on the left channel only. And I understood this and Dad was having a problem understanding it. And I'm trying to get him to realize what's going on here and what we gotta do, and before I know it, well first, everybody at the party is gone by that time. And then I woke up. I was going to say this early this morning, but I had the machine out and ready to go and rewound, and before I could record and speak, I like fell asleep with the thing close by.

So it's okay to ride the bus naked, but it wasn't okay to go to the bathroom all over everywhere. So [laugh] I really had to go, so I'm like by the side of the house going to the bathroom, and buck naked, and I'm peeing like a totally gully washer, and I finally finished that, and then I go poop. And oh, that was a lot! [laugh] And there was like gooey yucky mess all over everywhere and I can't even wipe up because there's no toilet paper. And then the bus pulls up and I'm running to the bus and trying to streak past these squeamish girls. And I get on the bus and I sit down and I'm finally okay.

And I entered slowly and gracefully like I planned to, and nobody even seemed to notice; they were so busy eating and talking, they didn't even see me coming in. Then I don't know where, I was outside, and I realized that it was a different party that I was barging in on, and so I had two hours before mine was actually going to start. We were looking at these Hershey kisses and deciding whether to put this on the table or not, and Dad said that if we put them on the table, people are going to throw their wrappers on the floor and it's going to look sloppy, so if they want Hershey kisses, they can ask us. And then I said that, well, if people want Hersey kisses, how will they know to ask us? If they're not on the table, they won't want to bother us for them.

"B-260"	"#B-260 (2003-04-15 (18)) I was at Memorial Stadium on a Saturday and Benjamin (?) was showing me this hand-held, real heavy device that reminded me of, it was about the size of the talking calculator, but it was a little heavier. It was some kind of audio editing device, and it was kind of a bluish color and it had a real wide LCD display. And it had a few keys along the bottom and a few up the side. And Benjamin was seeing that the labels were unusually large and they could actually see all of them. And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these -- what's the material? -- I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose. And I didn't know what I had to do with these alphabet letter blocks, but I had a feeling it was like making a story board for a movie. And there was also this book that was like the length of a novel that went with it. And Benjamin was going to try to teach me a few things so that I could make an order, because I had a notion that I was having a party that evening and I was going to make a border for the playlist for the party. And then we like ran out of time and he let me just take the thing home and learn some stuff on my own and show it to him on Monday, because he realized we weren't going to have any more time before the party. I remember looking at the time and it was 4:50 and I had to get home because the party was at 6:00. So then I make my way to the front and up the, I mean down the elevator, and I realize that I'm at Jungle Park [laugh] and I ask the lady at the front to use the phone because I dug in my purse and I didn't have the cell phone. And her phone was like whacko. It was like you would pick it up and instead of a dial tone, there was this commercial for like Spanish food, and you had to actually push a number before it would have a thing. And so first I dialed 505-0054 and realized that wasn't the one, so put it down and tried again. And then I dialed our land line and I don't think I got through. Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I'm going to say that before I could get through, Mom came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn't have to call. She picked me up in the parking lot, and instead of the car, she had the blue car that was like all beat up and these broken windows and this yuckiness, and I kind of was a little startled, I was like, ""Where did you get this?"" and she was like, ""It's Nan's."" And she said that it was a special model that was made to look like this to show that it had been through the war. And I was like, ""What?!"" And soon after I woke up."

And so we sat down and we were watching it, and we had the surround sound turned on, and I went up close to see it, and of all things [laugh] Flounder and Ariel were at a casino gambling and Flounder was like putting money down with his fins. And there was like all kinds of flashing lights and stuff going on [laugh] , and there were these other mer-people there that were like doing the same thing. And then all of a sudden, in the middle of their like card game, I guess it was, Ursula comes in and like waves her magic wand and makes everybody like silent and still. And Ariel and Flounder managed to escape because the other mer-people turned to stone, and then all of a sudden I'm like in the movie and I'm at this like Adventure Island kiddie pool, and this girl who's kind of dressed like a mermaid is saying, ""Jasmine, come this way; you're going the wrong way."" And I'm trying to remember what else was in it. I don't remember too much else. And that's all I remember unfortunately. I didn't have time to take this down this morning and now it's like 24 hours later, I guess, oh no, it was like a few. Now I'm all confused. Well anyway, you get the gist."

So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn't know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, Dad was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole. [laugh] So they set up the equipment -- the board and the CD players -- and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so Dad was like, ""You don't have to turn the power off,"" but I didn't want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn't; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn't, so I was real, real cautious.

And Dad decides he's going to turn off this tub faucet and make it flab, and so I'm like naked in the bathroom and I like came out of the bathroom and walked down to our room, and it was totally dark, so nobody could see me, but there were other people in the hallway. So in our room, and then I decided to go back to the bathroom and I go to the wrong bathroom. I go to the men's room and there's this guy taking a shower in his clothes and everything. He doesn't even really notice me, so I'm okay. [laugh] And then I go back to our bathroom and things are kind of okay. Oh, and then I kind of got some clothes on and took a walk around, then I was coming up the stairs to go back to our room, and this lady comes up to see me and she's like, she gets on a portable radio and calls the audio man, Jon Onion -- his name is really Jon Bunyan, but they call him Jon Onion from the Dome -- and wants him to help me.

Matter of fact, let me say that, first of all, this dream was the first one that I've ever thought was too silly to put on this tape. [laugh] Here's what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, Dad put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this like little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle (?), so I had to take this torch -- believe it or not -- the plastic end (?) -- this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn't light. It was starting to like get out of control and so I like threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn't go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and I had to like, it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more.

And I was in it by myself, and I had to go up to the third floor. And I kind of had the notion that there were more floors than three, so I kept pushing 3 to get to go up higher, and then all of a sudden I realized that it was going up past the third floor and into the control room shaft and the little trap door thing on the roof kind of lifted up for a minute and then banged down. And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press 1 and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing -- kind of later when I was outside -- I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff. And I realized I was in Ms. Marcos's class, in her 5th period, and I didn't want to be caught dead in a math class for an extra period than I had to be, so I got up and I walked out, and then I went downstairs, and I think I was going to some kind of party, but I woke up before I could get there."
"B-266"	"#B-266 (2003-05-12 (18)) First of all, I dreamt that I was at school and it was kind of like one of my last dreams and we weren't doing much in class. And [laugh] we were all kind of hanging out and partying and having assemblies and stuff, and there was this show, movie-like type thing that I was going to go and see in the auditorium with Mom. It was going to be a combination of Celine Dion and a few other people singing and doing things and stuff. And one of the officiants in the VE specialist office -- I can't remember her name -- but it was Mrs. Bernard or somebody -- was going to show me a shorter way to get there. And she said that I had to go through the Teacher's Lounge and through some teachers' special areas that no other students could go. Well, when I started going through that area with her, it was like a long hallway and a tunnel and several twists and several little office areas to go through, and there was this sound system that was very quiet, but audible, and very keen and very thin and very blah -- no frequency band width to it whatsoever. And so, of course, just like the Dome, it was mixed with this ""buzzzzzzzzzz"" sound, and as you were walking through this hallway, you would hear the sound coming, there would be the speakers mounted -- some on the ceiling, some on the walls kinda of close to my waist height, and some on the floor. And you would be walking by and any time you would get near one of them, and you could feel the sound waves. It would just give your muscles these sensations, these shaky, jittery sensations and you'd like fall down and stuff, like when I walked under one, it gave me these like tingles down my spine and just made me shudder. And then I passed one at my waist height and it like almost made me fall down. And there was one -- I was coming up to one that was on the floor -- and I just kind of totally like freaked out. [laugh] And I can't remember exactly what I did, but this assistant just kind of was walking along ahead of me and this was normal, and who was I to think it wasn't. And I think that I forgot something out of my locker, and I had to go all the way back around, but I went the long way and I wasn't going to go the short way, so I went the long way again. And then I finally got to the auditorium and the show was like starting already. And there were bleachers in there and I was walking down these big bleacher things, and actually there were like bleachers on the side and everybody in the middle had like normal seats. And I was going to sit on like one of the big bleacher platforms up real close so I could see. But I got there and I sat down, and Celine Dion was like in these long leather pants and this black top like I have, and she was singing something -- I don't remember what -- and then in the middle of a song she like takes off her clothes in front everybody and changes into this black dress that's kind of to her knees. And nobody does anything, nobody in the video audience or the real audience does anything. They're just like, ""Okay, this is normal."" [laugh] You know, that's all I can remember. And I think there was some guy, like Michael Jackson who was singing too, and that's all. Obviously this was a spin-off on the Dome offices. It's just that my imagination went absolutely crazy because the Buxton House had a whole house system too, and, of course, theirs sounded nice, but now I hope I'm not going to have this dreadful memory every time I hear a whole house system like that. It's just that I had this dying curiosity of how they work and what makes them work and how they're wired and stuff. But when I don't know these things, it's kind of frightful. I don't know how to describe it. Especially when they make weird sounds and so weird things like that."

And I was so resentful that Melinda sat there, bored as anything, but she was watching that movie that I thought she thought was interesting and we missed all the rest of the goings-on that day. And so I don't know what that means, but that was kind of dumb."
"B-268"	"#B-268 (2003-05-22 (18)) Today is my graduation. Last night I had this very, this dream. It wasn't really that scary, but it probably was supposed to be, I don't know. It might have been set off by Dracula or it might have been set off by being with Sandra and Lee who are Christians. I don't know what it was, but I dreamt there was this really awful like monster's den, but what it was is you would go down this river, and if the current would pull you the wrong way, you would get down this tributary that after a while, once you got down further and further, it would be, there would be more and more monsters trying to get at you. And they would all be surrounding you and they would all be moving in for the kill, and there was no way that you would survive that. And the worst part was, after you died, just like in Dracula, you would become undead and you would become one of them. And I had my little subdreams. I like dreamt that I was awake, and then when I wasn't like awake, I dreamt that I was like involved in that. And I would always like wake up every time and be like in the first level of dream before it would really be like not real. And I dreamt that I like read in the newspaper that there was one way to get out of that, that was to ask Jesus for forgiveness and suddenly you would just be out of that river and back like on some sidewalk. And I don't remember too much more. I know there was a lot more, but, of course, I put off putting this on here."
