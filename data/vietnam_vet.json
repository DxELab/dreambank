    "description": "There are three sets of dreams from this Vietnam War veteran, who had nightmares about his intense combat experience for decades after he returned to the United States. The first set consists of 98 dreams, including many nightmares, that he recorded off and on for more than 30 years after he left Vietnam (1971 to 2008).  The second set of dreams, consisting of 32 dream reports, was written down over a three-week period in 2015 (at age 66) at our request, shortly after he contacted dreambank.net to offer his nightmare journal for future research. The third set consists of 463 dreams recorded between September 2016 and September 2017.\nAlthough much has been written about the PTSD dreams of war veterans, this is the only journal we know of that contains a series of nightmare reports written down shortly after they occurred. Similarly, there are no everyday dream diaries we know of from a combat veteran who suffers from PTSD that consist of all the dreams that were written down daily over at least a two-week period.\nFor more info about this man's life during and after the war, including a glossary of some of the military jargon used in the dream reports, click here."
