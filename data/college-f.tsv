"001-1"	"#001-1 I was in a living room with my several friends. It was almost 9pm. Friend A asked me what I was going to do that night. I said that I was planning to watch Richard Wagner's symphony on TV. Soon, the program began. But the music sounded more like Gustav Mahler's. He is my favorite composer, but I didn't know for sure which symphony was being played. I just knew it was Mahler's, but not Wagner's. TV was showing pictures of the cosmos and a woman in white dress dancing. The woman seemed to be lost to meditation. It was an extraordinarily beautiful sight. Everybody else in the room gazed at the screen. I was still trying to figure out whose music it was. When the first movement ended, TV screened the title of the second movement. It had a name of some comet, which I was not familiar with. But I understood that the music was Gustav Holst's, ""The Planets."" (This is ridiculous because no movement in ""The Planets"" has a name of unknown comet.) Suddenly, I heard an alarm and noticed that the whole room was trembling. I went out of the room and found that I was inside of a big battleship. Many people in uniform were running around in a panic, but I remained calm, looking at the terrible scene wondering why they were so flustered. I went to the deck. It was still dark and the ocean looked very peaceful."
"001-2"	"#001-2 I was in my junior high school. We were supposed to bring foods for a cooking class. But no one in my group knew and brought anything. The school had a school lunch program and pots and pans had been already brought in and the classroom was filled with the smell of food. The teacher said that since we were going to have a cooking class, we didn't need foods provided by the school. I had to take a big heavy pan filled with some soup back to the food serving center. I was walking through a hallway. I was not in my junior high school but in my elementary school. When I finally arrived at the place where the center was supposed to be, I noticed that the school had been reconstructed and I had to go still further. The hallway was colored in green and seemed to lead to nowhere. It was like the yellow brick road in the Land of Oz. I crossed many hallways and each was a different color. The last hallway I crossed was colored in blue with a faint light. It had the name, ""Snow Road."" It was beautiful, and I thought that I had better tell my friends about this hallway when I got back to the classroom. I was now standing in a big hall. The green road forked off in several directions. One of them led to the harbor. I saw a man in a suit and asked him if he worked there. He said that he was supposed to see the principal but had lost his way. I said that since I was a student there, I might be able to help him. He said it was ok and disappeared. I saw the food serving center far in the right direction and walked toward that direction. When I finally arrived at the center, I asked a woman where I should put the pan. She said that I had to pour the contents into another pan. I did as she said, but the pan was not big enough. I left both pans on the table anyway. When I was washing my hands, I saw a teacher coming. I didn't know why, but I pretended that I was working for the center. I went out of the center and saw the man in a suit in the room next to the center, talking with the principal. I came back to the big hall, but I didn't know which road led to the classroom. I took the straight road and continued to walk. I passed the harbor. I was in a downtown area, which didn't look like Boston's or the downtown of any other American city. I knew that I had lost my way, but I kept walking. I was now walking through an alley. I thought that if I knew where the Prudential was, I could find my way. Since I was surrounded by buildings, I couldn't see anything. Then a truck came into the alley. I was almost killed. I saw another truck beyond the building and asked the driver if he could see the Prudential. He didn't hear me. Someone else answered. It was the voice of the driver of the first truck. Then, I saw the city of Boston far away. I asked him if he could give me a ride to Boston. He said that we were on a highway and had to turn around at the next intersection. We walked toward the intersection. The roads were too narrow, but the driver managed to turn the truck and I jumped in. I told him that it might be dangerous to use this highway, especially during rush hour. He said that since no one in Maine went to Boston for work, there had been no traffic jam on this highway."
"001-3"	"#001-3 I was about to take a plane to London with three of my friends. But the plane had already taken off. We followed the plane by car through the streets and finally managed to jump in it. It was a small plane without one [illegible] . Since there was no pilot, friend A had to fly the plane. When I looked down, I saw a map. We were flying over the big map. I could see the details, such as the mountains, the rivers, the deserts, and the forests, but not a single town. They looked real, but I knew that it was a map. We flew over the Middle East through Eastern Europe. Finally, we reached Siberia. All I could see was the frozen forest and I felt chilly. We wore as many clothes as possible. Then, we noticed that we were short of fuel. So friend A decided to make a landing. Landing went smoothly, and we landed in some unknown town. We went to search for fuel and came across a mansion. We entered the mansion and found out that it had been deserted. Somehow I felt alarmed and started running. There was no light inside, but something like lightning flashed once in a while. I knew that someone was following me. I could hear the footsteps. I finally got out from the mansion and found a hut. My friends were already there and there was also a middle-aged man. We asked him if he could spare us fuel. He wanted something (I can't recall what it was) in return. When we were ready to go on our journey, we saw the fuel tank of the middle-aged man blow up with a terrific explosion. Someone had shot the tank with a machine gun from the bush. No one was hurt."
"001-4"	"#001-4 I was in my grandfather's house. (He has been dead for six years.) I was lying down on a bed in a living room. It was an old studio, with which I was not familiar. I got up wondering which I should do: go back to sleep or study for a literature exam. My grandfather was cooking something. I noticed that two of my cousins also were there. One of them asked me if I wanted to have dinner with them. I said that since I had an exam the next day, I had to go home and study. They gave me a ride. It was dark outside. When we came closer to a tennis court, we noticed that there were many people both inside and outside the tennis court. We stopped the car and I went to see what was going on. I saw David Bowie talking to someone on a bench outside the tennis court. I entered the tennis court. It looked like a concert hall in the open air and was crowded with people. I found a friend of mine from high school and asked him what was about to happen. He said that David Byrne was expected to give a concert. Since he was not my favorite musician, I left the tennis court. On my way back to the car, I saw David Byrne singing and dancing a weird dance. I thought that the lighting was beautiful."
"004-1"	"#004-1 I was at my cottage down the cape with my whole family (cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.). We were having a cookout on the deck, buffet style. But when I took a plate and walked along the table, the food consisted of turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, etc. There was no regular ""cookout food."" I also remember getting ready for the cookout and looking in the mirror. I was about 30 pounds heavier and my hairstyle was awful. I was ugly and fat."
"004-2"	"#004-2 I went camping with my boyfriend and a few friends. We were falling asleep in the tent when I noticed a few frogs creep into the tent through a hole. I woke up my boyfriend and for some reason everyone was blaming me for the frogs. By then they were all over the place, jumping on our heads. The next thing I knew we were driving home with all the frogs in the car because I wouldn't let my friends kill them. I made them pull over so I could toss them into a stream off the side of the highway."
"004-3"	"#004-3 I was at an amusement park and I went on the water slide. But it wasn't the kind that you sat or lay down. You stood up, kind of like waterskiing. Anyway, it was crazy, and there was no way anyone could last this ride. The slide itself was metal and I remember looking around, and it looked like I was inside a factory or something. (Now comes the strange part.) I made it through the whole ride and landed in a pool of water. I went underneath and came up, and there was Michael J. Fox in the water with me and we started kissing. I guess he was my boyfriend or something. We just swam and kissed the rest of the dream. (???)"
"004-4"	"#004-4 My sister, Lauren, my mother and myself were at some sort of graduation exercise outdoors. We were driving there and we parked alongside a steep hill. I looked out my window, and I could see the caps and gowns below. For some reason we didn't get out of the car. We noticed a brown station wagon parked behind us. There were two men in the car. They appeared to be packaging drugs and putting them in the trunk. My mother and sister were in the front seat and were staring at them in the rear view mirrors. The guys saw them looking. They jumped out of the car and ran over to us with guns. I yelled, ""Duck!"" and they shattered our windows. My mother screeched away and they hopped in their car and followed us. We finally lost them. Next thing I knew we're at home and the doorbell rang. The driver of the station wagon came in. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and army pants. He had tattoos all over his arms. I pretended to like him and told him I wasn't interested in going to the police. I told him I was very attracted to him and I wanted to be his girlfriend. He believed me. He kissed me. He was gross. Then I woke up."
"006-1"	"#006-1 I had a dream that I was riding on a ski lift with other people. I don't think I knew the people. I was going to class but it took a long time to get there. It became scary for a while because something was wrong with the ride. I remember thinking that I shouldn't have gone on the ski lift, that I should have walked instead. I think by the time I got to class, it was over. I remember leaving some of my things on the ride but there was no way for me to get them back."
"006-2"	"#006-2 I had a dream that my friend and I were walking in my neighborhood all dressed up ready to go somewhere. We were passing some of my neighbors, just saying hi to them. We went to one particular neighbor's house. We both had trouble getting up to his front step. We had to struggle. (This neighbor does have a steep driveway.) There were dirt and rocks involved like we were trying to climb a mountain. We asked him if he would take us out to a club. He told us he could get us into some club. He said he would drive us, but we said that my friend would drive because we know how he drives (crazy)."
"006-3"	"#006-3 I had a dream where I used to work, the guys' clothes store called Dejaiz (a chain of the merry-go-round). I remember talking to people who I worked with but I don't remember exactly who they were. I remember one of them saying that I had better do a better job selling or they would fire me. Then up on the roof there was someone famous, so I ran over to see him. He was on stage so one of the bodyguards told me to go up the stairs because the bodyguard had mistaken me for someone else. So I did and he knew who I was and I knew who he was but then the dream ended because my mother was looking for me. She was calling my name."
"006-4"	"#006-4 This dream was about where I work now, at the candy store in the mall. Only one person works at a time so it is hard to call in. I was supposed to work but I forgot or couldn't get a ride or get down to work. I was working from my telephone at my house, in my room. When I woke up, I figured it was impossible because how can you work from a telephone at your house?"
"007-1"	"#007-1 I am walking up this hill with my friend Carolyn (in the neighborhood where my grandmother lives) and we see her cousin Joe. He is washing a car. (Joe does not live in my grandmother's neighborhood. I also have a crush on Joe, though he is really shy.) We see him and he joins us on our walk. We end up at a convenience store and Carolyn buys a magazine. When we leave he holds my hand and acts in an outlandish way (shouting, jumping. This is very unlike Joe. He is very still and quiet in character.) That is all I remember."
"007-2"	"#007-2 I dreamt I was working as a hairdresser for this woman's private business in her home. I don't remember what this woman looked like or if she was a friend of mine, but in the dream we were best of friends. I only remember cleaning the shop and sweeping the hair off the floor in the beauty parlour. I remember her saying that she would teach me how to cut hair and for now I could just sweep. I remember feeling excited that I was going to cut hair. It was as though it was the only thing I ever wanted to do in the dream. (I have never desired to be a hair dresser in my life.) That is all I remember."
"007-3"	"#007-3 I dreamt that I was in this room with no windows or doors and it was completely black. But, as I was moving around I kept bumping into people. (There were many in the room; I just couldn't see them.) I was also carrying a pile of books and then they dropped everywhere. I tried to pick them up but people kept stepping on me and kicking the books everywhere. When I woke up my heart was beating really fast and I swear the clock was ticking faster. (This was a really scary dream. I think it was the anxiety I was feeling because of final week sneaking up quickly.)"
"007-4"	"#007-4 This dream was ultimately strange and [illegible] enough. I remembered it before I was going to bed (on the next night of the dream). I was at Suffolk and I remember walking up the stairs to the State House Arena across from the Fenton Building. But, there was a house, a huge house with a big fence around it and it had grand doors (like doors on a church - wooden and carved). I went inside and walked up these very steep, narrow stairs to use the bathroom. (I don't know how I knew it was upstairs.) Anyway, there were a lot of people downstairs like a party was going on and as I closed the door to the bathroom a girl walked by the hall and called for her mother. Suddenly the mother appeared and directly asked me to leave. She said this was not the haunted house (?) And she was sick of ""those"" students looking for it and she wished they would get the address right. Feeling really sad, I left. But as I was leaving in the yard playing ping pong, with many people standing around watching, was Al Pacino. (I guess it was his house??)"
"010-1"	"#010-1 I was playing with my nephew in the park, and I demonstrated to him how to go down a slide, but I never stopped. The slide just kept on going and going!!"
"010-2"	"#010-2 I was lost, while driving, and ended up in Dorchester. I saw a stabbing and a shooting, went to police station to ask for help. And all I kept saying to myself was that I would not have been lost if I had a car phone!"
"010-3"	"#010-3 I was driving down the street and I went to put my foot on the brake, and it didn't work!"
"010-4"	"#010-4 The other night I had a dream that I was with an old high school classmate, Randy. We were sitting at this bar and this girl Tina, who we both disliked, came in. And Randy goes, ""Gee, you haven't changed. You still have big boobs and you look like a monkey."" Well, we both started laughing. And Gina replied, ""I don't know why I came here anyhow. You are both still obnoxious and I hate the both of you."""
"011-1"	"#011-1 I was shopping in Osco Drug with my brother. I picked up what I wanted. (I don't remember what it was.) I was then looking at typing paper trying to figure out what bond I should have used for resume in English last year. I remember seeing Mead's recycled typing paper, but I figured that would probably be a gray color. I then walked down the make-up aisle. I was looking for a deep facial cleanser. I couldn't find one. Then I saw a make-up case. It was big, and it was covered with a pretty carpet. I remember thinking it was like the bag Mary Poppins carries in the movie. Then I saw Rob from school (Suffolk). I thought this was strange, because he lived far away from me. He was standing at a counter writing something. A classmate from my high school walked up to him. She started saying to him, ""So, did you hear the news about Type A personalities? (I had this feeling they were studying to be doctors.) I awoke from this dream to realize my radio was on, and they were talking about how Type A personality people have a Vitamin E deficiency or something."
"011-2"	"#011-2 I had a dream about marriage noodle. They came in a blue can that was the shape of the Quaker Oats box. These noodles were kind of like soup only without much liquid in them. The expiration date on the noodles was for 60 years from now. I remember trying to figure out how they could last that long, and if they would last that long if they were opened, or would they only last that long if they were not opened."
"011-3"	"#011-3 I had a dream about watching a show where a dog went blind. It was too sad and I couldn't watch it. Then the dream switched and my cat is blind. Then we had gone to the vet where he sewed something together in the cat's head. The cat could then see. The cat became blind again. Apparently the thing the vet had fixed broke. The cat then had trouble getting around. My mom said he would have to be put to sleep. I refused to let this happen, because the cat was perfectly healthy except he was blind. I believed he would adapt and be able to find his way around without a problem. I remember hugging the cat, realizing they might put him to sleep. I then told my father the cat couldn't be put to sleep, but all he said was he would ask the vet what we should do. I was looking at the cat's eyes. They were bloodshot. My mom said maybe it was just a fluid buildup and it would go away soon. I remembered hoping it was, so he wouldn't have to be put to sleep."
"011-4"	"#011-4 I had this dream where my friend Jen was making fun of my puffy hair. Then my other friend Sara started saying more things about it. I then threw my keys down and ran out down the hall crying. Then I was in a supermarket and a girl I hadn't seen since high school came in line and she was comforting me, telling me it was all right."
"012-1"	"#012-1 Last night's dream was a strange one. I was outside, but I do not know where I was.  I was with my best friend and this kid she is starting to date. He is this kid we have known for about three years. The whole dream was not a complete story. It was just different scenes. I went from being at a friend's house with my friend and the kid she is seeing; to being at the Bruins game with just me and him. We were having a great time. Then in the next scene, we were at a wedding, but I did not know the people who were getting married. It was so strange. I was also in an ugly dress which I would never wear. It was gaudy and fitted and strange. The kid I was with gave me a grin which I absolutely could not stand. Then we were at my school and he was kissing another friend of mine. Then I woke up. It was very strange."
"012-2"	"#012-2 Last night's dream was quite unusual. I was at the place where I work, but none of the faces seemed the same. Everyone looked different except for me. I really felt like I did not fit in there, and everywhere I turned and everything I tried to do was different. It was as if I could not do anything right, and I didn't fit in anywhere. It was an awful feeling. I was wearing a dress and I had long, curly hair. The strangest thing about the dream was that every time I finished doing something, I found the same paperwork in front of me. It showed up in every room I went into. I could not escape from it. I wanted to scream. Every time I put the work away, it seemed to follow me. I could not complete anything the whole day. At the end, I was at my home with some man I guess was my husband. He said he had to talk to me. When I went into the room, he was holding the paperwork. It was [illegible] ."
"012-3"	"#012-3 The dream I had really makes no sense to me. I was at a bar with a bunch of my friends both male and female. A good friend of mine (male) was teasing me and aggravating me, like he usually does, when I had the strangest urge to hit him. When I went to hit him, I could not move my hands. I forgot about this instance, and in the next scene I was in the same bar and this same kid was teasing me. Enough was enough, and I went to punch him. This time I had no hands. This continued one more time, except this last time I had only one arm and one hand. I was chasing him out of the bar and into a forest ready to punch him with my hand, making a fist, when I was awakened by my alarm."
"012-4"	"#012-4 In this dream, I was getting married to an old boyfriend I had seen on the street the day before. He looked really handsome and the whole ceremony went really great. The bridesmaids wore green. Just when the ceremony was going perfectly, I saw that his current girlfriend was one of my bridesmaids. This was really weird, because we do not get along with one another. Another strange thing about this ceremony was that once we were married, we were running in the Summer Tunnel but we could not get out. There were other people walking there too. It was like one lane was for driving a car, and the other lane was for walk-throughs. It was real weird. I still had on my wedding gown and he had on his tux. We just could not get out of the tunnel. It seemed like we walked for days. Then in the next scene, we were in a [illegible] house that was unfamiliar to me and we were eating pizza and grapes. I still had the gown on. Then in the next scene we were still in the tunnel but sitting down taking a break from running. The dream was not like a story, it was just like a bunch of scenes that did not make any sense."
"013-1"	"#013-1 This dream involved only myself. It was very warm outside so I decided to go out. As I was stepping off my front porch onto my stairs, I got hit in the head with a football. The strength of the impact knocked me off the porch onto the yard. I did not see who threw the football. This was my entire dream."
"013-2"	"#013-2 I dreamt that I was walking along the beach with a bunch of my old girlfriends who I had not seen in years. There were six of us together and we were talking about all the changes we had been through since graduating from high school seven years earlier. One of the girls, to whom I was the closest, had told me that she was getting a divorce and she needed a place to stay. The dream ended with us moving her in."
"013-3"	"#013-3 This was a difficult dream because it was all about my good friend's death. I more or less relived her funeral. I was at the church, looking at her in the coffin. I all of a sudden couldn't breathe. In the dream I then fell to the floor, and I had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The last thing I remember was the doctor telling me that I was also going to die and I had only three months left to live. It was at this moment that I woke up."
"013-4"	"#013-4 In this dream, my mother was in the hospital. She had gotten sick and she was put in the hospital for emergency surgery. What I remember most about the dream is that I was feeling so helpless. I remember feeling like I wanted to just drag her out of the bed and take her home. The whole entire dream just involved me sitting in her darkened room with her after her surgery. I remember that I could not stop crying."
"014-1"	"#014-1 I had a dream that it was college graduation time, but not my graduation, but I was still going to graduate. It took place in a school gym room. I think it was my high school gym. There were five people to be seated on a platform that faced the spectators. I was one of them. They were all women. At one point another woman had to squish between me and another because there wasn't any room left. After that there was a speaker. She faced us, not the spectators. She was weird-looking, but voguish, she had walkmans on. She recited this weird poem. When she said the last line another speaker also said it at the same time, as if she knew the whole poem. Then we all got up and I assume we were going to a larger room. This is when I saw people that I knew I wouldn't be graduating with, so I left. I walked up some stairs. I was supposed to be in school, but it looked like the Burlington Mall, but without the stores. I got to the ninth floor and went into my Informal Logic class. My teacher made bacon. Everyone got the first piece free, but if you wanted more it would cost 2 cents a slice. There was even a sign on a plate that had the bacon on it."
"014-2"	"#014-2 I was riding up a street in the neighborhood and stopped at this girl's house to borrow a school book. It was 11 pm. All the lights were out in her house. I rang the bell and her mother answered. She had to go upstairs and get her. While I was waiting, I turned into someone else. My car door was open. A guy came out of his house and was threatening the lady. The next time I loked at her she was burnt (but like in cartoons, not really raw red burn). Then she tried to get away from him in a cornfield. The next scene they were on a cruise ship. There was a lounge. The bartender was talking to another guy. The lady came in and tried to make a scene like they were arguing in an attempt to get some help. The bartender was too busy listening to the other guy. Then the couple disappeared. I think they were just looking over the railing of the ship."
"014-3"	"#014-3 I was in Purity Supreme. In one of the vegetable trays were these mini-mini Christmas trees. I felt like I was a home decorator. There were only about ten. They were $50 each. I think I bought four. I knew they were expensive, but I got them anyway. I was imagining a little town being built in between them. They were all decorated with snow."
"014-4"	"#014-4 I dreamt that I woke up and my bedroom TV was on. Lady Di was being interviewed. She had longer hair. The interviewer (I think it was the famous woman who asks a lot of personal questions) was asking Lady Di personal questions about her marriage. Next her daughter (?) came in from behind a screen door. She was very attractive with long blond full hair, lots of make-up, wearing jeans, long earrrings, blue eyes. She all of a sudden said to the reporter something like, ""Listen, you can tell Skinner (meaning B.F. Skinner) that you can't observe my behavior only; you don't know what I think."" Something like that anyway. She was really strong. Lady Di (her mom?) was strong too. This all took place on a closed-off front porch. i never saw the interviewere, only Lady Di and her daughter like they do on a ""real"" interview shown on TV."
"015-1"	"#015-1 I had a dream that I woke up to go to school and I put my high school uniform on. I walked down the street and went into a store to buy a bagel with cream cheese. When I asked how much the bagel was the woman said something like six dollars and change. I gave her a ten dollar bill and she gave me back ten dollars and some change. Then I left the store to go to school. No matter how hard I tried I could not get to school. People were stopping me on the street and wanting to talk to me, but I kept saying I have to go as I will be late for school. After that my alarm went off and I woke up."
"015-2"	"#015-2 I had a dream that I went into an apartment house and rang one of the bells for my friend to come downstairs. (The ironic thing about that is that none of my friends live in apartment houses.) Finally all my friends and other people were all gathered in the hall. When my friend and I left to go to my car I noticed that someone had smashed my car while it was in the parking lot. The driver's side door looked like someone took a metal stick or pole and scraped it. The front of my car looked like someone just smashed right into it and left. Then some kid who I know because he is an acquaintance of my ex-boyfriend told me that he knew who smashed my car. I kept asking him who did it, but he wouldn't tell me. Then finally he told me that he was the one who did it. I can't remember anything after that because I woke up."
"015-3"	"#015-3 [Before I went to sleep I was in an extremely bad mood.] I had a dream that I was parked behind a red Volkswagen. I was picking up my brother at school. Every time the VW moved, I moved. This went on for a few minutes. The person in the VW was my brother's friend, but I didn't realize it until after he got out of the car. Anyway, you could tell that the person was getting aggravated with me, but I was in such a bad mood that I didn't care. Finally he got out of his car and started yelling at me. So I got out of my car and started yelling and swearing at him, telling him he could take his little red car and shove it you know where. Then before I knew it my mother was calling me to get up."
"015-4"	"#015-4 I had a dream that I was riding in a train on a dirt road. The train had no roof. When the train stopped I got out and saw desks with typewriters, telephones and computers on top of them. People were sitting at these desks and looked very busy. Then I turned around and I saw Roman Brady who is now John Black on the soap opera, Days of our Lives. He came over and started talking to me. Then I was just roaming around and I bumped into all my friends and my ex-boyfriend's friends. My ex-boyfriend was not there. Once I bumped into them I could feel myself getting very upset and angry. They started to tell me what my ex-boyfriend was up to. I can't remember exactly what was said, but I do know that it made me cry. My friends and my family were there and they tried to calm me down. This all took place in my grandmother's backyard. After I stopped crying, I went over to the swings and began to play on the jungle gym and play on the swings. The funny part about that is that my grandmother hasn't had a swing set in her yard for about 10 or 12 years now. She had the swings when I was a little girl. Also in my dream while I was playing on the swings there was no pool in the yard, and my grandmother has had a pool since I was either 12 or 13 and I am now 21."
"016-1"	"#016-1 I dreamt that I was in a huge plane with my mother. I don't know where we were flying to but I believe we were going on a trip. All of a sudden the plane started to have mechanical problems. The captain came over the speaker and said we were going to crash. I was so scared almost to the point of being hysterical. I grabbed my mother's hand and ran to the storage part of the plane. The plane was falling, but not head first. It was falling flat. Since it was falling this way, we were elevated to the ceiling. I then heard the captain say, ""This is it."" I told my mother that I loved her and I think I started to pray. The plane crashed on its belly and I fell from the ceiling to the floor. My mother and I both were fine, just a little banged up. I was so happy, but then this fear came over me that the plane could still blow up. I ran to the door and tried to open it up, but it was locked. I looked out the window and saw a bunch of police out there with their guns drawn. However, all I could think about was the plane could still blow up and we had to get out of there. I saw a fire extinguisher and I tried to knock out the window. As I was doing this, the captain and some passengers were yelling at me not to do it because the police might shoot. They tried to explain that there were hijackers on board and the police might get anxious and start shoooting. But I didn't listen. I think I thought that I would rather take my chances of being shot than die by the plane's blowing up. So I broke open the door. The police raised their guns, but they realized my mother and I were [illegible] so they waved over to us to run to the police cars, which we did. As we were running the plane blew up, but my mother and I made it. Then I woke up."
"016-2"	"#016-2 My friend and I were driving to Boston. When we were almost there I stopped at a gas station to get gas. While I was doing this an attendant came over and said I could park in his parking garage if I wanted to. I asked my friend and we both agreed to park there. We went to Faneuil Hall that night. When we came back to the garage at about 1:30, the parking garage was all lit up with very nice and expensive cars inside. (It looked like the parking area on top of Beacon Hill except it was lit up.) As I proceeded to my car I noticed that my tires were all flat. I was totally flipping out! I couldn't believe that all my tires were flat. Just then I saw out of the corner of my eye my best friend's ex-friend. We never got along in the first place, but when I became friends with my now best friend she became very jealous. She thought I stole her friend away from her. Which of course is quite far from the truth. Anyway, once I saw her I knew that she was the one who did it. I was so angry that I went over to her. She knew I was very angry, so she  started to run. So I ran after her but her boyfriend stopped me. I told her she is going to pay for everything that needed to be fixed on my car. Her boyfriend knew I meant it and even told her she better listen to me."

When we pulled in the front of the mall, Steph put the car into neutral. I got out of the car and walked to the front doors and started talking to her roommate who was already there waiting for us. I saw Steph get out of the car and walk towards us. As she was walking towards us I saw my car moving. I ran out and started yelling at Steph. I was saying, ""Didn't you put the emergency brake on?"" She said, ""No."" I couldn't believe it. I then saw my car going towards a cliff. I started yelling for Steph to go get my car or it was going to go off the cliff. Just then she started to run as fast as she could after my car. Just before it was going to go over the cliff, she got in and slammed up the emergency brake. She backed it up and drove it back to the front of the mall. I was so [illegible] ."
"016-4"	"#016-4 There is a really cute guy in one of my classes this semester. I dreamt that, after one of my classes on Tuesday, I had a couple of hours off before my 2:30 class. I was on my way to the Sawyer building when I saw the cute guy coming out of the Sawyer building. He was on his way to a shopping center which in my dream was at the bottom of Beacon Hill. Since I had nothing to do I decided to follow him. I couldn't believe what I was doing, but I really liked him. He walked into the store and I followed him. I pretended that I was shopping and that I didn't even know that he was there. When I went around an aisle I more or less bumped into him. I acted like I was surprised to see him. We talked a little. It was a bit awkward because we don't know each other that much. We were both pretty much done with shopping and we more or less walked over to the counter together. When we got out of the store it was just about 2:30, so we walked to class together. I [illegible] went to class. When it was over we got on the [illegible] to go for a drink. Of course I said, ""Yes."" Then my alarm clock went off and woke me up."
"018-1"	"#018-1 My first dream since I received this sheet has consisted of some strangeness. To start off, I had a dream about my best friend (Patrina). She was working in a shoe store. I was in the store trying on shoes. Three girls came into the store who we did not get along with. They wanted Patrina to wait on them, but she didn't. (My girlfriend really works at a hospital, but she loves shoes.) Anyway, later on in the same store, my church had a fashion show. There was a lot of food. The dream just seemed to switch. I didn't even know about the fashion show. the next thing I knew I saw one of my old friends Andre. He said hello to me, then I woke up."
"018-2"	"#018-2 My second dream consisted of two of my good friends. One is my best friend, Trina. Well, I was at my girlfriend's house (Trina), at least it looked like her house. The view was kind of foggy. I was climbing up her banister in her apartment. (She doesn't even have a banister in real life.) Anyway, I don't know why I was climbing up her banister. The next thing I knew, I saw her father-in-law arguing with this woman who he was supposed to be dating. He was trying to tell them both that it was over. Their names were Mary and Toni. So after a while I found myself outside with Trina and Pam. We were going out to eat. We walked by the Boston Common. All of a sudden, Trina started collecting popsicle sticks. She would eat the ice cream and then she would save the sticks. Trina gave the sticks to some guy so he could make a funny object (a doll stick). The next thing I knew Trina and Pam were fighting over the pendant that Trina had found. Then I woke up."
"018-3"	"#018-3 My third dream was kind of crazy. I went with my ex-boyfriend to the mall in Canton, but it was my other ex-boyfriend. One's name is Devan, the other Bobby - both are my ex-boyfriends. Bobby would always be talking in the dream, but his appearance always looked like Devan. It was Bobby's voice, but Devan's face and body. Anyway Devan/Bobby gave me money to go shopping in the mall. I bought soap, lotion and a jacket. Plus, I had my own money. Devan's mother met us at the train station and took us to the Canton mall. His mother thought that we were back together, but we told her that we were just friends. Then I woke up."
"018-4"	"#018-4 In my fourth dream I was in McDonald's getting some French fries. Then I went to the bus stop to get on the bus. When I got on the bus the bus driver took my French fries and started eating them while driving. I noticed he had a McDonald's cup near him on the window side. While driving I saw the top of buildings and the top of trees. As I got off the bus, the bus driver gave me a beautiful sapphire ring. I smiled. As soon as I got in the house I called my ex-boyfreind. Bobby (who I just broke up with recently), but his mother told me he wasn't home and hung up on me. Then I woke up."

And over them into the backyard I saw a pond with ducks, geese and swans. As I looked into the house, his brother was on the phone. Once his brother, Donald, saw me, he looked relieved! He hung up the phone and came towards me! He said, ""Am I glad you're here! I can't get these guys out of my house!"" As I looked around, his deadbeat friends were all other the place. The house was a mess. Garbage all over the floor, graffiti spray-painted all over the walls! That was found in every single room. Donald didn't know what to do! As I inspected the house, I started to get angry! These kids were disgusting pigs! Slobs! I remember going downstairs after him and seeing Donald saying something to his drunk friends! The next thing I remember saying was, ""Okay, everyone, get the hell out of here now!"" And the guy downstairs said to Donald, ""Why should I listen to her?"" And Donald responded, ""Because she's my sister-in-law!"" And I remember feeling very happy about him saying that! So I went around the house kicking his so-called friends out and slowly, they left!

We were lost for a bit until this guy helped me find my way and he also carried my luggage! He got us to our gate in time to check in. I remember grabbing my bag from him and running  to the gate! Then as we checked in, we still had some time before takeoff! So I turned around to thank the guy, but he was gone! So we went back to the mall part to look for him. I do not remember if we found him, but I do remember the reason for Mary and me to have to take this trip together.

And the both of them did not want to hold the guy's hand that was next to them. They wanted me to get between them and the guys. They were squirming away. But I had no problem with it at all!

She was always always late, and Beth made rude comments about her to me! Beth didn't like her, but was extremely fake to her! She pretended that she liked her. Our boss was overweight and wearing a pair of tight leopardskin bicycle shorts. Her stomach was hanging over the waistband.

When we first arrived we setup our campers and tents. Then each family cooked their meal for supper. Later on in the evening the young children and teenagers went to the Rec Hall. Back in the campsite the older crowd sat down and played the game Screw your Neighbor (4 corners) and Scattergories. The following day my mother, my father and I went down to swim in the pond. But the pond was no longer a pond; it was more like a brook. While I was swimming I began to notice the bottom of the brook was filled with slimy creatures and there were squirrels everywhere. I remember looking to the side of the brook and there were squirrels looking me straight in the face."

The man was first telling us there were no cars left. Then a car was found for us. I thought it was awesome because we had to travel across the country in order to reach New York. I was excited because I felt independent and knew it was going to be an adventure."

I'm wearing nylons and a white slip and I pick a real pretty bright flowered skirt which I have never seen before to wear for the day. My boyfriend picks another weird outfit. When I try it on it looks awful and too tight. Also on my bed are these pins to wear with my outfit but somehow I can wear them as clothes too. Some pins look like mannequins others look Halloweenish. We all are in the living room now: me, my mother, my boyfriend, my brother and, I think, my father. We have three small Christmas trees with red tinsel and my boyfriend brought over green tinsel for my mother. She is happy about that. As it's time for me to leave, I realize that I forgot to take a shower and my hair is all up and somewhat messy. I fix it up quickly because I am in a rush. Then I ask my boyfriend if I can have a ride to school, but he says he can't and I think he has a good excuse. Suddenly I'm walking him outside and my dog is barking and howling like he's really mad! Then I notice that there is a hole dug up by an animal in my front yard and the animal looks like an opossum. But as my boyfriend goes outside, it seems to be a different kind of animal than I have never seen before. They try to bite him. One did bite him and I was so mad!

Our date consisted of a jazz festival-type fair with another couple. But on the way to the park we had to cross over a bridge that was very narrow and unsturdy. It felt like if we moved even the slightest bit, we'd fall. There were rocks below us. Oddly enough we were then buying cotton candy and watching clowns juggle in front of us. [The next thing I knew I was awake; it amazed me. The wierd thing about this dream is that I actually understand it and it makes sense to me. I don't know if I'm supposed to tell the significance of all this but since I know the background, I might as well. This guy and I have had the rockiest and most controversial relationship ever. Our getting together was what we saw as inevitable, but we have actually come far. I think that's where the narrow bridge and rocks down below come into my dreams. This was a big obstacle to overcome and if we overcame that we could actually survive. The odd part is the big cookie, which he never actually gave me in the dream, but when I was awake I knew what it was. I woke up before he gave me the box and I still knew what it said. I think this is due to all my friends saying how much he really cares about me.]"

It seemed as though I knew about this restaurant from a long, long, time ago in real life, but I can't seem to figure out what it reminded me of. (It has been sort of bugging me since the dream.) We then had to walk through quite a nice hotel lobby and there were formal dances going on. We were still trying to get to, at that point, an unknown destination. We were trying to figure out elevators and other things. A maitre'd asked us if he could help us but we thought we could figure it out. The restaurant didn't seem to be much of a priortity at that point.

This surprised me quite a bit in my dream (also after I woke up!) because we are good friends who have known each other over 20 years and have never expressed any romantic interest in one another. I only remember saying, ""Oh,"" in my dream and thinking that what he said was so nice and tender.

I was then in her apartment, only I knew in my dream that this was my house that I was renting out, not knowing it was to her, or that it was once my house and I sold it. I'm not clear as to which was the case. (After I woke up, I realized this house reminded me of the house of my mother's friend who I used to visit quite often as a young girl with many differences. My mother died eight months ago and her friend has been dead for many years.) The first part of the house I recall in my dream was the roof patio. Natalie had expressed that the house was in bad shape and needed quite a lot of repair. We were looking at the floor of the patio and its red terra cotta tiles that looked quite nice to me. However, Natlalie wanted to replace them. I'm not sure why. We then went into the living room. The wallpaper was so old, dirty and torn. It was in terrible shape. As we were walking through, I saw some kind of porcelain doll that I thought had belonged to my mother. There might have been other items that I thought to have once been mine or my mother's. I was surprised to have seen them there. (I did not recognize any of the items in real life.) I also think there was a sort of hurricane lamp. I was trying to fix the chimney part of it. (In real life I do feel a sort of connection with this sort of lamp and feel as though I remember my family had one that resembled the one in my dream a long time ago.) The chimney was either missing, broken or crooked, I'm not sure. I was quite agitated about this doll and some of the other items. I may have felt that I didn't want to lose them and felt connected to them in some way."

He asked, ""Are you parking here?"" and we said, ""No."" He said, ""Then I don't know where the stadium is."" I said, ""If we were going to park here you would know where it was?"" He said, ""Yeah."" We parked the car on the street and walked down one street. A man came up behind me and grabbed me. He was older with glasses and his hair was messed up. I kicked him and grabbed onto his clothes. They ripped and I ran away. I was screaming and running as fast as I could but it seemed like I wasn't getting anywhere, like slow motion. I finally reached my friends and the man was arrested."
"035-4"	"#035-4 I was home at my mother's house with a bunch of people: Carey, Sascha, Lisa and Candy and some others. We were building a whirlpool in the backyard. We had to rake the yard first and figure out a location that would be best and where there were the fewest trees. I was raking near some bushes and found some old magazines with the cast of LA Law on the cover. I then went into my mom's house and we were sorting out the mail that came. For some reason Carey's friend Lisa gave us a present. It was a necklace with charms on it. Then we all were outside looking at the mail and went back in."
"038-1"	"#038-1 Thursday night, 1/28/93 I'm in my bedroom and I hear a scratching noise. I turn and see a brown paper grocery bag which is in front of my shelves where my stereo is. I walk over to the bag. I know there is a lobster inside only I can't see him. I remember thinking that this situation was familiar as if I were thinking, ""Oh, yeah, I remember that there is a lobster in the bag in my room that has been there for two days, going on three. I don't want to eat the lobster (I don't like lobster), but I know I am going to cook (boil) it. I have to cook it. I feel badly because it is suffering by being stuck in the bag trying to scratch its way out. I want to let him out but I resist. I'm not sure if I should. For the life of me I can't make a decision on how to end his suffering. I know what the answer is. All I have to do is let him go, but I can't bring myself to do it. I know I can't cook him yet, but I need to end his suffering and sadness. So I go upstairs to my brother's room (my older brother, Dave) in the attic and I ask him how can I end the lobster's suffering. I have no idea what Dave said. End."
"038-2"	"#038-2 Tuesday night, 2/1/93 I went to surprise Rob at the studio. I got there and I couldn't find him. I was asking around and no one knew where he was. I was in a hallway in my house upstairs only on a larger scale. All of a sudden Rob comes out of the bathroom in the doorway and says, ""I don't want to see you anymore."" I was in shock because it was very sudden. I was relieved in a very small way but mad at the fact that he didn't seem a bit remorseful. I felt stupid like, ""How dare he dump me?"" I was mad at myself. When he came out of the bathroom he was holding a razor and his mustache and beard were gone. He had shaved them off while he was in the bathroom."
"038-3"	"#038-3 Tuesday night, 3/93 I was in my friend's apartment (it was a girl from work, Charlene) and I was amazed at the apartment. Jaimie (from my old job) answered the door. I was happy and surprised to see her but I didn't feel I needed to make a big deal. We were sitting around. The apartment was big. It had a contemporary artsy look with pastel colors (pink, green, yellow, peach and black). Charlene asked me if I noticed anything different about the place. I named some things like the furniture, pictures, etc. None of it was right and then after much guessing Charlene finally said, ""Jaimie's here."" They didn't think I realized that Jaimie hadn't been around in a while. I was very glad to see her, but I just didn't go on and on about how long it had been since I had seen her."
"038-4"	"#038-4 Wednesday night, 4/21/93 I was in my room and there was a strange person there. I'm not sure if he was a baby or an adult. He had blonde hair long on the back above the shoulders but cut close along the front and sides. He was very small, smaller than a midget or dwarf in fact. His body from chest to hip was so small it looked like he had no body. He almost looked like the Head Detective from the show ""In Living Color"" only his arms didn't come out of his head. I heard some music playing. It had a Latin beat and I danced with him. I think I was afraid of him or more uncomfortable but we danced and it was fun. He seemed really sweet almost childlike. I remember telling people or wanting to tell people about the weirdest thing that just happened, me dancing with this little person in my room. I think he was a good dancer."

I feel very surprise because I have never think they will spend that much money to go on this trip, and I am the only one can go out of all my sisters and brothers. I cannot believe it that I can go, then I start to think of the beautiful views of the places. My parents tell me that we will be leaving in the summer. I am too overexciting then that led me to wake up with a depression."
"040-2"	"#040-2 At one night, it was so cold in my room because my radiator didn't have heat, so I had to get a thick blanket to get my body warm. When I went to sleep, I had also covered my head with the blanket. Later, I had fallen asleep and I started to dream. Now, I am in this small elevator with a crowd of people. It is so narrow that I can hardly move my head, and people keep squeezing in. The elevator is very slow. Although I am gradually suffocating, I keep telling myself that the elevator will open very soon. But, then I cannot breathe. Oh, my goodness! I am suffocating. Help! Then I woke up and my hands raised up high to remove the blanket from my head. I inhaled so hard."

I have to fly to some other country, but it is too late. I am stuck. Many soldiers surround the bushes with guns, and there are bombs flying over my head. I try to run very hard, but I cannot. I am too scared and I am out of breath. I can hardly open my eyes. Suddenly, a soldier opens fire. I jumped up off my bed and cried out loud."

I stare on the wall, where I post all my favorite idols. I like them and keep doing my dancing movement. Suddenly, my idols turn into real people. They all gather around me. I feel very happy because I can talk to them and hold their hands. Oh, my goodness. I will have a chance to know everything in Hollywood. I ask one of the famous actors if he had a girlfriend. He said, ""No, I don't."" I am so happy and I fall in love with him. He is so handsome. Then we are holding hands. After, he comes close to me and whispers something in my ear. I cannot hear him because there is a loud ringing sound and it is nonstop. Suddenly I woke up and it was my alarm clock sound."
"042-1"	"#042-1 I was standing outside of the house of my old best friend/worst enemy. I have known her throughout elementary, middle and high school. To say the least, she made my childhood a living hell. Anyway, I walked into her house and started looking around at the furniture. I saw nine place settings at the dining room table (that's how many brothers and sisters she has), but no one was around. I waited for a few minutes and then called out, ""Hello. Is anyone here? Hello."" Suddenly, an elderly, white woman appeared from the kitchen. She was drying off a dish. I didn't know who she was. I thought it weird that she was there because this family is Lebanese, not white. I asked her where Christina and her family were. She said that they were all out and they wouldn't be home for a little while. She asked why I was there. I had a plate of big chocolate chip cookies in my hands. I told her I was delivering these cookies to the family. I noticed that one of the cookies was half-eaten, so I took another cookie and covered over the half-eaten one. As I did this I thought to myself, ""She'll (Christina) never see this half-eaten cookie."" I left a short message with the cookies. It read, ""My mother thought you'd like some cookies,"" and I didn't leave my name. Then I walked out of the house with a smile on my face. Then I woke up."

I tried to escape by going out a window of one of the rooms, but in every room there was something hindering me. For example, in one room there was a panther; in another there was a bird, etc. I went into one room and found the character of ""Seven"" (a little kid) from the television show ""Married with Children."" I told him that if he helped me, I would give him a lot of candy. He agreed and the three of us climbed out a window. The lady who looked like ""Malificent"" screamed at us not to leave. All of the sudden I heard a lion roar. We ran and hid. The lion was trying to find us. I stepped out and was going to face the lion, but it had turned into this big, beefy guy. I had a gun, so I shot at him. It was only a water gun. He just laughed and was about to kill the girl I was saving. I shot at him again and then he shot at me. The gun was not a normal gun, though. It shot a bead of red light, but he missed me. I started to laugh and said, ""You missed me."" He said, ""But the bead won't."" He pointed to the bead. It was bouncing around and I feared that it would hit me, so I picked up a long beam of wood. I blocked the shot with the wood and grabbed the bead, which now was a silver bullet. I said to the guy, ""Ha! This is a silver bullet. I'M RICH!!"" The guy got really angry and picked up the other long, wooden beam. At that moment I got a view of William Shatner. His face just covered the screen of my dream. Then I woke up."

I went to their house with someone else, but I don't know who. I was standing in the kitchen and the couple walked in. The only thing was they were two guys. These two guys were the parents of the child I was going to babysit. Then I saw two women come in the kitchen, another two men and then another two women. All of these people lived in this house, but each couple had their own floor. They started asking me questions and all I could think about was, ""These people are gay and lesbian."" Then the dream suddenly switched to my meeting my friend Audrey and her boyfriend's new baby. She's not pregnant in real life, though. The baby was a normal size, but had the face of a grown man. He said to Audrey, ""Hey, Mom!"" And gave her a kiss on the cheek. Then I woke up."

He says to me, ""I'm gonna dance to the 'Rockin' Robin' song."" He started dancing and lip-syncing the song. I watched for a little bit and then left. Then I was in a big truck, driving with my youngest sister. It was weird because the steering wheel was on the right hand side. My sister was sitting very close to me and I asked her why she was. Then I asked her to move over. There were two guys in a car ahead of us and we were chasing them. They tried to lose us. Then I was at my friend George's work. He asked me to dilute this drink that he had. It was brownish-orange. I went over to the sink and started to dilute it. I noticed I was putting hot water in the drink, so I dumped some of it out and poured in cold water up to the top. I gave it to him and he was like, ""This is VERY diluted."" I said, ""Well, I'm the daughter of a science teacher; when you ask me to dilute, I dilute."" Then I woke up."

The exterminator placed a light bulb, which turned out to be an explosive, underneath the sink in the bathroom. He put another tube under the kitchen sink. This tube looked like a roll of pennies. He told us we had 30 minutes to get out of the apartment before it went off. Somehow we couldn't get out. We each could pack one bag, but we weren't able to find my dog's sweather and it was cold.

I would have my friend dive in and get the bag but he didn't have any scuba gear with him. If he jumped in, he would have to hold his breath for a while and chances were he may not come back up.

"105-4"	"#105-4 I'm on a ferry to the Vineyard with six of my friends. I'm walking on the beach with a hot red bathing suit. This faceless man approaches me and we go for a drink at a pub on the beach. My two friends walk in and give me a look with a smirk on their faces. I'm on Cloud 9 because I've met the man of my life. Then I go into the hotel to get changed for my date with this man. Then he comes to the hotel with flowers. I'm riding high on Cloud 9 now. Then we walk on the beach and a tidal wave washes him away."

"108-2"	"#108-2 I was in this camp where they watched everything you did. They had a pool with tons of stairs all over the place. When you ate you had to stand in line while they regulated how much food you got. Then they had guards that made sure you didn't take any food with you when you left the cafe. If you did you would be penalized. (I don't know how.) That's all I can remember."
"108-3"	"#108-3 I had a dream my boyfriend had a skylight above his bed. (Those big windows in the ceiling.) Anyways, one morning we woke up and I noticed a building where you could see up into other people's apartments. Which of course meant they could see into ours. I noticed this guy standing up against his window with his face pressed against it looking down at us. At first I thought he was a pervert but then I saw someone come up behind him and put a gun to his head. Then he shot him. The guy that shot him noticed us staring back at him. When he realized that we saw the whole thing he pointed the gun down at us as if he were going to shoot through that window, then our window, to kill us. We both rolled off the bed and tried to get things together to leave. He and his partners found us and shot us in the back of the head. I remember feeling the blood drip down my back and falling to the floor. Everything got cloudy and I tried to talk to my boyfriend but the words wouldn't come out right. I didn't feel any pain -- just felt like I was getting sleepy. Then the ambulance came and I woke up."
"108-4"	"#108-4 I was waiting in line to see Luke Perry. There were thousands of girls waiting to see him. He and I kept making eye contact with each other despite all the girls in the way. I was the very last girl in line and when I got to the front he looked at me and said, ""What took you so long?"" Then he gave me a hug and a kiss. Funny thing is I don't really care for Luke Perry!"
"112-1"	"#112-1 In the room, there are my parents and a grandmother who in real life is dead. And I am crying, I am crying very hard. Tears running like a river. I was holding my grandma and she was crying too. We didn't say a word; we were just crying. I remember, that it was in a country, because through the window I could see a beautiful garden on the hill, which was far away. My parents were sitting and their faces were very surprised. Then we went to the backyard and I saw people sitting on the ground, in a narrow space between two houses and eating something from it. Also around there were small pieces of bread. From the place where we were sitting to the place where we saw those people, the way was very narrow. We had to squeeze between two very high walls at some point. These walls were [illegible] from [illegible] and I could see the beautiful [illegible] through them."
"112-2"	"#112-2 I was getting married. I was marrying the boy with whom I went out a couple of times, but not my boyfriend. I asked myself why am I doing that. I didn't want to, but I was going to. In the room, there were my parents and grandparents. At first, I had a dress on, but it was not the white one. Then at the last moment, I decided to change it, and put on a blouse and a skirt. Everybody was waiting for me. My father was very nervous. Then I saw that my mother, my grandmother and my grandmother's sister are wearing similar blouses. Then I remember that I pointed that out in mind very clearly. Everybody was asking me why am I marrying this boy. I answered that I have no idea and that I know that it is wrong. Then everybody went to the elevator. And I don't know what happened next, because the phone rang and I woke up."
"112-3"	"#112-3 I was leaving the classroom, and I had a lot of books in my hands. I also had a bag. So, I gave one book to one of the girls. It seemed that there were four to five of them. I remember clearly that one of them was my best friend from Russia. By using the stairs we went down and came to another classroom. There I asked the girl to give me back my book. But she said that she lost it and showed me an empty bag. I was very surprised and at the same time angry. ""I thought I could trust her, but she stole my book and doesn't want to give it back to me,"" thought I. I remember thoughts like that: ""I trusted her. She said that she'll do me a favor and will carry my book for me, but she didn't."" How could I believe anybody if they say one thing, think the second, and do the third? My best friend was trying to calm me down. Finally she was holding me and I was crying. Everybody looked at me. The girl was smiling and talking to some other girls. I also remember that there were a lot of people in the room."
"112-4"	"#112-4 I was on the first floor of the big bookstore. I looked on huge shelves and had a strong feeling. Then I took one book out and was trying to look what it was about but I could not. Something, some kind of force, stopped me from doing that. Then, I turned my head and looked to the right. There was my mother holding my little brother. They were looking through some books and it seemed that they were trying to find a particular one. At first I couldn't move, then I managed to get closer to them and offered my help. They said that it was not necesary that I better go and do what I had to. And I knew. I had to do something, something in the air was telling me about that. But, I don't know why. I didn't do anything. I just could not, something was holding me and I couldn't break [illegible] ."
"122-1"	"#122-1 It was around 8 o'clock. This is usually when my family finished eating dinner. All of us sat in the living room watching TV. Suddenly my older brother was telling me that one of his friends likes me. He asked me, ""Do you know Scott?"" I said, ""Yes."" It stopped there. Then I went to another dream in the same night. My boyfriend and I were sitting in his house's living room. He was seducing to have sex. He put his lips on my neck. The next thing we were in bed. The dream stopped here. Then I woke up."
"122-2"	"#122-2 I was at the train station ready to go home. My friends came down to the train station (Park Street Station) to get me to go with them. I went with them. I threw my schoolbag in the train (when the train was here). We were playing chase. Later it was time for me to go home. I realized that I didn't have my schoolbag with me, so I went back to the station and waited for the train to come. The first one arrived. I asked the driver did he see a schoolbag in his train. He said no, and instead threw me some keys with an address tag clipped with it. I decided to send it back. I was still waiting. The second train came. I asked him the same thing. I saw my schoolbag. I went to get it and went to get my car. The dream stopped here, and I woke up."
"122-3"	"#122-3 It is a school that I went to that I have this dream. In my mind I always think this is a scary school (spooky). One day I went to school. There were no students there. It was so blurry in the hallway. I went in my class to sit down anyway, because I thought I was early maybe. Suddenly, there were so many people with white long dress and long black hair chasing me. I ran and ran. Up and down the stairs. As I was running some of my friends came. We all ran together. We were all trying to find the exit doorway. It took us a while. We found it. One of them got one of my friends' leg. We pulled (hard) to get away from them. I felt so relieved after we got out. The school exploded. I woke up. When I woke up my two thighs are so tired."
"122-4"	"#122-4 I have the dreams back in the senior prom at high school. They all went to the hotel conference room first. Later, I arrived by myself. They were all sitting down ready to eat. I walked in and said hi to everyone. Somehow I don't understand why everyone is not dressing up. I was all dressed up with a white prom dress. My hair was fixed. I was wearing a pair of white gloves. I was just ready to go to spend my special night. Not they are not dressed. My boyfriend was driving crazy. He didn't sit next to me, and didn't get a chair for me to sit down. Instead his friend did."
"133-1"	"#133-1 I had a dream that I woke up really late the next morning and I missed my train. I tried to catch the next one but something happened just as the train was arriving and I missed that one too. I got really upset because I had two tests that day and I didn't know what to do. It was already late and I wasn't even in Boston yet!"
"133-2"	"#133-2 I had a dream that I was watching my two fish swimming around the tank and they were fine. A couple of hours later I looked at them and they were swiming on their sides like they were sick. I got upset. I didn't know what I could do to help them, so I just watched them while they died. Then I cried and got very upset."
"133-3"	"#133-3 I had a dream that I was at work and it was time to close the store. I went into the back room and shut all the lights. When I came back out there was a guy in the store who said he wanted to buy something. He was acting kind of strange. He went over to the register. The girl I was working with rang his sale up in the register. I started to walk into the back to turn the lights back on and he shot my coworker. I ran over to him and I was screaming for him to stop. He shot me too. Then I woke up!"
"133-4"	"#133-4 I had a dream that I was at home in the living room watching TV. I heard a noise in the hallway so I slowly opened the door to see if there was anyone there. (There wasn't.) I did this a few times and finally the last time I opened the door slowly again and waited to see if there was anyone around. After a few moments a shadow gradually appeared and then a man. I got really scared, but I couldn't scream in the dream. He was getting closer and closer to me. And I remember thinking I wanted the dream to end because I was so scared. I did wake up. The dream never continued."
"136-1"	"#136-1 I dreamt I was in the church which was part of my elementary school in this big uncomfortable dress. And both sides of my parents' families were there. We were waiting a long time, and no one knew when the ceremony would begin. I asked my aunt and she said, ""We won't get out until after midnight."" All of a sudden I saw my boyfriend drive by in his dirty pickup, full of junk, in the back. I ran out calling his name and chased the truck to the light where they were stopped. He was with one of his friends he hasn't talked to in months and they were both dirty. Then I woke up."
"136-2"	"#136-2 I had a dream that I was getting on to an elevator. As soon as I started to walk in and turn around the shape of it changed. It was like a garage door started to come down. I tried to get out but it closed. There were other people on the elevator and then the elevator started to go out, faster and faster. Then (we?) realized that it was passing all the floors and we were going to go out of the building. I was really scared and I went into the corner by myself. Then the elevator flew out of the building and then I woke up."
"136-3"	"#136-3 I dreamt I was on a river that had rapids across it. I was with like five men and we had to cross the river across the rapids. One of the men got swept up and died (the first one). Then I was at a big cliff with a girl and we were running from something. So we started to scale the cliff. We got to the top and couldn't go anywhere. Then it turned into the top of a building, when I looked down, with glass windows. We were both hanging from the ledge by our fingers. I tried to get down but I was really scared and I couldn't move. Then my mother was on the top of the cliff. I was crying 'cause I couldn't get down. I was asking her for help. Then I realized I was standing on a table in my living room with my hands stretched out to the ceiling. She told me to get down."

I wouldn't go unless someone went in and made sure no one was in there and it was safe. No one would do it. Finally some man went in looked around and said, ""Fine."" I went in, turned around and saw some guy staring in the window. I screamed and ran as fast as I could. I ended up on the subway.

We were on our way into the store and we had to stop at the ATM. When we were standing there the person in front of us was having problems. When he left the money slot had money sticking out of it. So, we started taking the money out. It kept coming. We got about $175. Then we left. She was on her bike and I followed her. We were behind a building counting the money, but one of the tellers from the bank caught us. She took the money back. She said she needed it, and then my dream ended."
"142-1"	"#142-1 I went to a 25th Anniversary party somewhere on the water at night. When I got there everyone from school was there even though it was for a family member. I had to crawl under electric fences and past attack dogs and also climb on rocks that were on the water edge holding on for dear life or I would have fallen in the ocean at night. When I finally got there someone dressed weird was spitting into the grill and the flames were getting big. Then everyone started doing it and the flames were huge. He then picked up the grill and folded it in half and it turned into a portable plane with flames coming out of it. He was playing with it and waving the flames at everybody. My grandmother is scared of fire so she made me walk with her over to a neighbor's yard so she could get away. I put her in a chair at a table so she could eat but it was too low and she couldn't reach. Plus she kept falling off. I was getting more and more cushions to stack but it just did not do. Then I was getting dirty laundry to put under her but she still kept slipping off."

I was wearing all my clothes in the shower. For some reason even though I was washing with soap and standing right under the water I was not getting wet. I finally realized I had my clothes on. So I took them off and then the class was over. My ex-boyfriend and the teacher of class came into my shower like I wasn't even naked and started talking to me. I sat down on the bottom of the shower to shave my legs and there were little ants crawling up the side of a wood pole in my shower because the shower was made out of wood."

When I got up closer I realized it was four teenage boys who were just shot in the middle of the street and were bleeding everywhere. They looked like fresh animals that were just killed. I was curious because there were no ambulances or police there or even on the way. But the only thing I could think about was how thankful I was that there was a long line at the bank that I had just been at. If there had not been, it might have been me who was shot because I would have been there at that time."

It did a full circle around crossing over my stomach. Then it ended up at my right side jumping on my chest in an attempt it seemed to wake me up. The legs were black except for the white [illegible] paws. It kept jumping on me until I put my hand up to stop it. Then I jumped up looked around my bed and didn't go back to sleep."

She was dressed in a long flowing white gown and had a bright light shining around her. She looked at me and smiled. She stood around for a while then floated off into the air. I stood and watched her as she hovered like a bee. She started flowing down. She got a little lower and looked at me. She smiled at me. I smiled back and walked over the edge. I was floating with her. Flying around and over the green below us and having fun."
