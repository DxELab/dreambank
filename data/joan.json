    "description": "Joan was a college student in her mid-20s when she wrote down these 42 dreams in the mid-1980s. She is a lesbian who is dealing with relational issues in the dream series.  These dreams are of interest for those who might want to study possible themes and metaphors in a dream series. That is, her issues seem to be expressed metaphorically in some dreams, but we won't spoil your fun by expressing our hunches.  (For more about this series, including the dreamer's own commentary on her dream journal, click here.)"
