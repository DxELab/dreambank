    "description": "Kenneth began this amazingly detailed series of dreams during his first year in college, writing down every dream he recalled for the next three years, sometimes two or three a night: he reports that he'd typically wake up multiple times per night and jot down extensive notes of the dream imagery, actions, characters, and emotions.  The next day he would write the dream down in full based on these\nnotes, which often took more than an hour each day.  Therefore, this is the most complete home dream series we have.  It is also the best series we have from anyone under age 21.  It shows great consistency in its major characters and themes over the three-year period, but has not been studied in detail.  It shows how realistic dreams can be for some people."
