"0243"	"(2005-01-27 (14)) I was at the movies with the school except it wasn't? Parvati was there and everyone was being gay. Then we were at a classroom. We were doing art and I had to find somewhere to sit, but everyone was making it so I couldn't sit next to them."
"0244"	"(2005-01-29 (14)) There were people from Alias and Victor Garber had this really cool handwriting that I tried to copy. We were doing some mission thing. We tracked down people to a castle thing. I don't know what happened, but we got passed (I think we shot some) guards and then this person caught us and people or something were shooting things at us. None hit us and we escaped with ""important information"". We picked up a call that was meant for other bad guys. They were saying stuff in code that I worked out and they had said something about a playground. Victor Garber's handwriting I mentioned earlier was seen because he had written a letter that I was reading at the castle place. It explained some information about the castle. He had weird t's that looked like the t shown in the diagram, but they were cool. We were at some desk place. There was one person per desk and people were inspecting them. I opened a door and some guy was there and I was apologizing but I actually had to go in to get some messages. Then we were at the playground. The bad guys were almost there which we knew because we could hear their car. We left two people there with a note saying ""Do not harm or we'll play Jay-Z and some woman singer [don't remember who] "" and they didn't hurt them."
"0245"	"(2005-01-30 (14)) I was at an airport, and there were creepy creatures there with levels. Jayson was there being gay."
"0246"	"(2005-01-31 (14)) I was at some hotel and Ezra went swimming with seals in this fake little beach thing they had. It had waves and all. I was all of a sudden in a hallway in the hotel, running from the water. There had been a leak and I was following four horses? I got to a door and closed it and ran upstairs and the water came through."
"0247"	"(2005-02-01 (14)) I was at some shop/Timezone place with David Anders (we were friends). I turned around to say something fusty and then I 'dreamt' what would happen, I can't remember what was said, but it turned out badly. When I finished the 'dream', I couldn't find him. I think I found him again and I 'dreamt' again and I saw Jennifer Garner and he was making out with her. Then I finished that dream, and I don't remember what happened properly, but we found out that we liked each other and then we supposedly had sex, which I don't remember and then we were lying in bed and he said something about some Banana in Pajama's banana's penis and I said something how he couldn't have sex because it was probably smushed when he was born."
"0248"	"(2005-02-02 (14)) Some crazy guy came over looking for Mom. Her car was here, but she wasn't. I told him this and he threatened me with a knife and I told him again. Then he drove off and Mom came back. Mom and I went to the shop, a deli, and they had Blade costumes. There was Blade and some fat lady one. Mom got Blade for me, size 69, which was really small, though it was a large/medium. Anyway, it was too small and I wanted to go back but she didn't. Then I was at school wearing it and then I scared some evil spider off. Jayson was writing something about his birthday and I said I forgot to do that this year and he thought I was just copying him so I got on the computer, but could only find prev [can't read, starts with a p, and is possibly 'previous'] . This happened at a cemetery? The crazy dude came back. Someone had a baby. Johnny Knoxville was there, but he was some ""Apple"" guy. Then the father of the baby got killed. Johnny put his clothes on and sat in his truck. It had a big playground area for an animal on the back. I saw him and he motioned for me not to tell anyone so I didn't. I got another costume, which was size 71, and it fit. Some people came and we said the baby was dead. They thought it was a joke and we made them run through the house to get out and then I found out that the baby was alive."
"0249"	"(2005-02-04 (14)) Kaitlyn, Jocelyn and I were friends. We were in class at some weird place and I said something about Fat Nicki and Kaitlyn having a fight and Kaitlyn got upset. Jocelyn wrote me a note or email saying I was cool, but I shouldn't have said it. Something happened at a video shop, but I don't remember."
"0250"	"(2005-02-05 (14)) Louis and Gage (both Pet Sematary) were at a park place with lots of trees. Louis was in a tree poking an octopus and trying to make something collapse. There was some toy that kept being advertised and Gage wanted one. In the park, I think someone was murdered. A holocaust of some sort was happening and Louis was either trying to kill or protect Gage, but I don't remember which."
"0251"	"(2005-02-06 (14)) There was this person I knew who could 'call' water and control it. Some 'friends' and I were at this creepy place and there was a flood thing. My friends and I were only a few of the people still alive and we were at this school looking after some noob kids. Some retard chicken hatched. We left and I ended up at a shop place with escalators. It started flooding, and we all started running up, but I realized I would get caught, so I jumped down and swam back to my friends. The water girl also caused a little wave while we were walking. And there were people holding a meeting."
"0252"	"(2005-02-07 (14)) I was friends with Yelena. There was a hotel with creepy monsters. Also, Yelena said she was my friend, but she wasn't my best friend but she was? Her ex, who was hot, came back and she asked me to write a list of the hotest guys out of a list. George Clooney and her ex were on the list. Also there was a creepy taxi guy."
"0253"	"(2005-02-07 (14)) Veronica lived at home and was fat and disabled. I threw her because I got angry and then she and Dad went to a hippy party. I spilled honey on my school shirt. Dad had a party book thing."
"0254"	"(2005-02-09 (14)) There was a holocaust happening on the 21/3/05 (the day before the Green Day concert) and it did. Bombs fell from the sky and the house was getting destroyed and then me and a heap of others were in space and then these aliens put us in this big spaceship. There were lots of people. Ezra and I were together, but we couldn't find Dad. The alien explained that 2000 years ago something happened and it would cause a holocaust on this day. They had being trying to stop it since. I was worried about not seeing the Green Day concert and my stuff and the pets. Then they said that little brothers could come and pick a dog for the family. I walked off for a second and Ezra came back with a big brown puppy. I said to call it Chico and Ezra said that it was a gay name. I also complained that it was a big dog and that he should've gotten a smaller one. Then I saw Mom and Darren and they had a black and white dog. I told them to call it Chico. Then Ezra said ""I thought ours was Chico"". I was upset because I hadn't known whether Mom and Dad were alive or not."
"0255"	"(2005-02-10 (14)) I was at a house which had a pool and my class was doing swimming. The house was spooky and in the walls were big scary rooms. I think there was a shop ""attached"" to the house. The room filled up with water and me and this lady had to run and close the door, but the door was going to open because of all the pressure. We ran into the store to a container of water and then the water came but was coming over in little waves. We ate M & M's and there were gnomes. We opened a door and the water was gone."
"0256"	"(2005-02-11 (14)) I knew 'Jesus' who looked exactly like Jim Caviezel. We were close. There was this place, a cemetery, where Jesus' grave was. It was hell hard to find. Anyway, these people kidnapped me and I knew them a little and they took me to the grave. They were going kill me because they didn't like Jesus or something. Anyway, the ground was shaking and no-one seemed to notice. Jesus was coming to get me."
"0257"	"(2005-02-11 (14)) There were two freaky frogs. I was in a sandpit playground with the class. I was looking for money?"
"0258"	"(2005-02-13 (14)) Something happened and my phone broke or something. I went to this shop and the guy working there told me to take a free phone cover thing but none were for my phone. I remember Michael Palin was there somewhere, but I don't remember why."
"0259"	"(2005-02-14 (14)) There was this girl called Cheyenne, who looked a little bit like the real one, but she was foreign. The real Cheyenne looked different and had a different name. She wanted to be my friend and kept following me, but she couldn't speak English. I was in a toilet and the door was munted because I went to the special toilets, there were two sections. One section had loose doors and was for noobs, and the other section had better doors and I changed to a good toilet. Mom, ""Cheyenne"", and I were in a car and Mom was taking us somewhere but I don't remember where."
"0260"	"(2005-02-19 (14)) I was at a fair thing. There was a little shop and it had Monty Python and the Holy Grail figurines and I was looking for one of Galahad and I complained because there wasn't one, but there was. The fair was scary, really dark and spooky. Mom and I were in some weird town place and we had met a famous person, I think it was Michael Palin, at a little coffee shop on a corner. Also, at this fair was a little supermarket. I lost Mom and there were these aisles with Green Day poster things everywhere and then it was outside and I went on a water ride slide thing and there was another girl and Terry Jones and Michael Palin were in a car in a show and it kept changing."
"0261"	"(2005-02-22 (14)) I was at school and swimming was on and I don't remember properly but some people were evil. Then something happened and I was on this little planet thing which had gotten a bit blown up and the aliens from it had come to Earth. This other noob was on it and nearly fell off, but Zim (Invader Zim) was there and saved him (he wanted to use him for something). Then we were on this train and it was spooky and there was a shower and when we went under it we got sucked up to this kooky place. The alien guy said it was a ride and we went again. I went under the shower but then it was third person view and it turned out the alien guy took me because he liked me."
"0262"	"(2005-02-23 (14)) I was at school and I was hanging around with Liliana and there were lots of fish and we kept looking at them. My science teacher was wandering around too. I was also at Nana's and this guy who was actually my math teacher Teacher-M-09, was trying to sell these cheap games, and Ezra and I kept running from door to door so he would go there, thinking someone was there and we also had a tunnel thing. He found out what we were doing and then tried to find us and he was evil."
"0263"	"(2005-02-24 (14)) I was in England. I was with Mom and we kept turning up at this material factory, which was in France or something and the guy there tried to shoot us. Also, at this shop they had all this Monty Python and Fawlty Towers stuff and Monty Python movies -- like Alien 3D. Then Granma and this person who had a really fat kid were around too. Fat kid went to lie down on a trampoline and Mom got Granma and fatty to go. I got lost from Mom and ended up in France. I asked this bloke, who looked like Teacher-M-05 and he spoke English, to help me, and he said he would. After a while I found Mom and I got rid of him but on our journey I had gone to Mom's car. When we got to the car he tried to take it but then I did these hell cool moves and he got hurt and we left. And this girl and I opened up a shop with these weird things and everyone was buying them."
"0264"	"(2005-02-25 (14)) I was at Mom's and I was in her room. I looked out the window and saw these people coming out of a car, two women. I knew they were bad and I went into my room to hide, but the daughter of the two, who looked like the one from that gay Mayhem movie, checked all the rooms and found me. I can't remember properly, but they took our stuff, including my phone, all our phones, but the young one gave me a phone, for some reason. She kept calling me and teasing me because she had my phone. Mom and I went to the car and they had pulled it apart taking stuff, although one part of her car they didn't check and it had one of Mom's phones, so they hadn't found it. The people came back and I was complaining because they took my phone and she ended up giving it back to me."
"0265"	"(2005-02-26 (14)) I was at Mom's and all the guys from Monty Python were there, except Gilliam and Idle (ie Chapman, Cleese, Jones and Palin). It turned out that John Cleese, Michael Palin and I had this sort of love triangle going on. I also went to school and my English teacher, who was called Teacher-M-02, but wasn't him, and I also had some fusty thing going on and I was doing well in English for that reason. I was also in a class and the people were singing the Lumberjack song and I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts except it said something about work. There was also a big stage. Something bad happened though. Then or before all this, we went on a school camp thing. Terry Jones and I were sharing a room, why he came on a school camp I do not know, but we had this little room. Anyway, someone knocked on the door and it was a guy with a creepy mask on. I kept screaming and laughing. Then he left and I said ""now a real evil person will come"". The door opened and an evil person thing was there. Then Terry ended up on a cross, upside down, but he was ok."
"0266"	"(2005-02-27 (14)) I was at Midvale High School except it was the start of Year 10 and it looked completely different. There were millions of kids there (just for Year 10). They had a shop at the school, like a Target, and an electronics store that was open all day. I got bored and crawled down this hill, through a hole in the fence and earlier on, I went to the shop and I wanted this jumper. There were two big change rooms, a girl and boy one. I didn't wanna change but I went to go back behind a cabinet and I don't know why but they took my shirt off so I could try it on. Whitehall High School people were there and they were being evil. Also, Dad and I were at this shop buying pencils and we got these Monty Python things too. Later, I wanted to go back to the shop, but I couldn't until lunch or recess because they would wonder why I was there. Later, we had a freaky camera thing and we could fly and stuff and we went to this building to take pictures. There were freaky people around."
"0267"	"(2005-03-02 (14)) I was at home in the office and we had heaps of computers and two offices. My computer was going crazy so I got up to see what the problem was. The light in Ezra's office was flickering and then it would go off and then it started giving electric shocks. No phones were working and we needed to get a hold of Mom. But then she turned up with a torch. We were at a cafe place. This guy kept talking to us about something and then his wife left him. Then these two scary old people wearing makeup made him and his wife some dinner with strange vegetables. Mom was saying how her painting was taken by Nana 20 years ago. Nana was like ""move"" and then took 'her' painting from a box. Some street name was Chollatel or something. At school we had to picture we were in a cemetery. Then, the teacher, Ms P asked me a question about using an 'ajouk' board. She meant Ouija board. We were playing a board game. We also talked about noses and I had a cold."
"0268"	"(2005-03-04 (14)) I was at school and I made my own computer. There was a little tube thing I used. Then we had to go into groups. Cheyenne and Jocelyn went to go in one group. Derrick got this guy to chase me because I embarrassed him or something. When school finished I went to this place where I had got a mouse from to ask if they were special. The girl was pale and fat and ugly. We also went through a drive thru and the girl serving us had braces and she was hard to understand. Then 'today' we didn't go to school."
"0269"	"(2005-03-05 (14)) Ezra, Jayson and I were at some place that had Chicken Kiev. But it had maggots and stuff in the building. We cut the Kiev open. Then we were all sitting/lying on this glass thing which was sort of resting on this other thing, so when we moved, it would tilt (in the air). There was another one near us, which two people were dancing on. We turned to look and then Ezra made it go spazzy and Jayson and I fell off except some glass part came too and Ezra was fine. We fell into the water. We got out and there was this futuristic place with all these buildings and there was a little boat thing that went underneath the place which was on top of the water. Now, one part of the story was that I was old and I was thinking back, and the other was that I had dreamed it before, but before we knew Jayson, and he was replaying it in first person, and then it was a movie we hadn't seen for ages."
"0270"	"(2005-03-05 (14)) I was with Mom and at first we were at a place with Porky. She was running around and then we had to leave and I told Mom that Porky was out, and she told me it wasn't her that she was in the boat or something. I ended up jumping out of this cart and running back to get her. Then Mom and I were at a fair place. We went on a freaky ride with lots of old people. I said to Mom that I was going to sit on the edge, but some old lady had taken my spot, so Mom sat down elsewhere. I thought I would have to sit next to someone else, but a seat was free next to her."
"0271"	"(2005-03-07 (14)) I was with people from school and we were in this creepy house place. Someone told us to go through it all with one light, which I had. We were walking through and I can't remember what but something scary popped up. The place was arena like. Also there was some game where you had to kill this werewolf snake, except it didn't turn into a werewolf. We found it and we were killing it down to its last health, but we needed wolf bane so I got whoever was with me, to go and get it. Then we killed it."
"0272"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was hungry and Mom and I went to a petrol station to get food and a car was crashed near it and then it blew up. For some reason, we couldn't go to the petrol station. We snuck back to the car and then Ezra and Jayson did too, because there were these ranger people who liked stopping people. We got in the car and one guy came up to Mom's window, but she drove off. They followed her and ended up crashing into us, we got out of the car before it blew up, then the ranger people died. I was starving and somehow I had managed to save some stuff, we kept trying to get a ride, but people thought we were bums and kept saying no."
"0273"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was at a video shop and we were looking for movies. I went to ask Mom how many Species there were and they were right in front of me. The highest was 19. Gattaca was there too. There was also this movie of us, which I can't remember what happened, but it was stupid."
"0274"	"(2005-03-09 (14)) I was at a place that had some books; I think it was a library. There was a group of people, all ladies, wearing a few different clothes, but about 3-4 people were wearing the same outfit. There was a man, but he was a crazy retard guy. There was a bookcase next to him and I was trying to look, but his arm kept flapping. Somewhere else, Dad mentioned how he liked it when Ken (A Fish Called Wanda) yawned or something."
"0275"	"(2005-03-14 (14)) I went to school and people were talking about a new Beatles song. I don't know what it was. They also kept saying 'Paperback Letter' instead of writer. Then I was in the library and Svetlana, Yelena and I were doing weird colouring-ins and playing Uno. Some people were also wearing Green Day shirts. I sat at a table in S+E, and then that gay Classmate-M-30 guy also sat at the table and a camera kept moving. There was a strange map. I had a shower at school and Mom was supposed to be taking me to get an x-ray but she sent me to school for a bit and I walked out of the school."
"0276"	"(2005-03-16 (14)) Mom kept calling Will Smith, and his 'servant' answered the phone and Mom said she was a friend of his. Mom rang back again and Will answered and then hung up saying ""Stop calling me!"". Anyway something happened and Will was over here and I knew him and we found all these different coloured tablets -- ones that would make you want to increase population, watch comedy, get stressed, calm down, get nervous etc. He chose the dark blue one -- to increase the population. He turned into a girl, who decided to be my best friend. We went to a cinema and I found that I could create more rows of seats with people from different times. I made one that would have Michael Palin in it and then I went down and sat next to him. I said hi and he seemed shy or nervous or something. I asked him what the date was and I don't know what he said and I asked the year, and he said 1963. I thought, 'Ok, he's 20'. I started chatting to him and he got up and then motioned for me to follow. He went to a place where they had DVD's. He found A Fish Called Wanda and he was going to get it for me, bit I didn't want to tell him that I had it, so I told him about a special one that I'd seen only at a video shop and it would be cheaper, and we went back to the cinema. We sat in the front row next to each other. He started kissing me, and I was giggling. He was kissing me like when parents kiss their babies, all over their face. My old pal, Will, was getting angry except it wasn't actually Will anymore, but I'm not sure what happened, but the Will thing got angry and we had to go somewhere. I got in this Ute thing and Eric Idle got in the other side to drive. Graham Chapman hopped on a motorbike as did Terry Jones or John Cleese. Not sure which one. Michael and Terry/Darren got in a car. I waved to Graham, maybe mistaking him for Michael. Ezra was in an ice-cream truck thing. We got to a place where they were building a building. I ended up really high, hanging from a rope. I was about to let myself go, when people came around the corner and tied rope to my foot and I went back and I was ok. I caught up with my friends and there was a game where you pick which presents to give to which animal thing."
"0277"	"(2005-03-17 (14)) I was at some place. I was in some group with Liliana, Classmate-F-18 and some other randoms. Liliana had driven to the place we were at. I was walking around some of it and I walked past Ms Hampson and I think that guy, I think his name is Classmate-M-25, was also with her. Then I past that other Darren guy playing tennis by himself, and he hit one backwards and almost hit me."
"0278"	"(2005-03-18 (14)) Mom had just picked me up from home and there were police cars everywhere. We started taking all these strange roads and for some reason we got out of the car. We were walking and this drunk guy came up and said to Mom ""cracking piece of crumpet"". He said something about me and guitars. I was like ""What?! I'm only f-f-thirteen!"". We ran away and I called Dad and then we hid in a ditch thing at a park. A policeman drove past and somehow Mom took his car and then got me. We stopped for fish and chips and then we were driving and in lots of places there were police depots? We went in and I remembered to get keys. The lady at the office thing let us in and we were messing around with videos of this lady whose car we had taken. Luckily, she looked a bit like Mom. They had a big DVD player. Some people thought that she was different. The lady gave Mom name tags and she had to put them all on the right person. Then we were allowed out. I went home and I left my bag up on the street. I remembered and ran back to get it. It had stuff missing, like my phone. These two guys were there and one of them had my phone and I snatched it off him and got my jumper and the other put my bag high up in this tree. Then Loren Dean and some other person came by, they were friends of Mom and they were cops?"
"0279"	"(2005-03-19 (14)) I was at school or something and there was going to be a Monty Python live show with Graham Chapman somewhere. The teacher told me I missed it on the telly."
"0280"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I wanted to walk to Germany for some reason. I thought we were in London at one stage and Mom said ""No, we're still in our country"". I wanted a drink of water and we got a cup but I threw it away after having a few drinks and I said I dropped it. We were near a lake thing."
"0281"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) There was this creepy place on the edge of an island, it could have been the edge of a country or something and there was lots of scary water. I think Ezra got lost in the water, except he was younger, like 3? But he got out alright. There was a medical centre too, which was scary looking. I think we went in, but I don't remember."
"0282"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I had to kill these 3 guys because they had a jewel thing which was needed to stop some evil thing. This building had exploded but it looked ok. Upstairs there were evil things, made from a good effects computer game. I killed two of the guys and one was Will Smith. The third guy was in a car with some person and they had locked the doors. I got them to come out and explained to them why I was doing it. The third guy came up to help me. It was all effects up there. It was all made of holograms but I still had to pass it. I was at a 'Timezone' place. It was pretty evil. Mom was there too and you got heaps of points, but it was really hard. There were strange people around."
"0283"	"(2005-03-20 (14)) I lived in this house with Graham Chapman, his sister [which he didn't have in real life] and his mother. Later, it turned out that Graham and I were engaged. Anyway, I went to a pub place which was joined to the aforementioned Timezone place [but it was a different dream] . I got home the same time Graham got home and so did his mother, we went to go in but his sister, I think, was on the phone and we listened to her conversation which didn't make sense. We went inside and I cleaned up the sister's room with a piece of paper which sucked things up. I went to my room and was cleaning things up properly, when I heard someone whistling. Graham had opened my door a little and was whistling some song. I turned back around, but he continued whistling and it was annoying. I asked him what he wanted and he said ""a kiss"". It was just a 'peck' [Sims wise] but then it turned into a 'smooch' or 'makeout' (it was extremely vivid, and I can remember how it felt and tasted). I think earlier on in the dream, Graham and his sister had tried out this new trend, which was walking around naked, but Graham didn't like it. Also when we were all walking home, I hugged a pillar near the house and there was 'ae' written on it and I said ""I love a's""."
"0284"	"(2005-03-21 (14)) Dad, Ezra, Jayson and I were sitting on this high scaffolding thing. We were all sitting on thin bits and kept almost falling off. We saw this hamster in a hamster ball and it fell off this cliff thing onto the road. Then it got run over. Dad and Ezra kept pretending to push me over, but I somehow stayed put. We then tried escaping but it was no use. I don't know how we got out but then we had to find some dead kid and get something out of him. We walked through this scary swamp and he was there. I had to light a match/lighter to go through him (he was a ghost though). We got the thing we were looking for. Dad had made me wear rubber boots. There was a flashback of something. Then we were in a puzzle room like Banjo Kazooie. The kid flew off and we had to jump into the picture to find him."
"0285"	"(2005-03-21 (14)) I was at Granma's. I ordered some free thing over the net to her house. It was Christmas but it was December 5. I kept asking why it was earlier but no-one knew. I went downstairs and there was a package at the door. In it was an old That's Life! I opened it and it was mine from 2002. I showed Granma and then Mom came and she took me to this place and said that the package and been picked up and the right one was dropped off. Wherever we were, there were two animals that were dead. I was standing close to one but I moved back because I thought it would get up, and it did. It hopped into the bushes. Some people from Monty Python were there. Mom pretended to drive off, but she accidentally did and I had to quickly jump into the car."
"0286"	"(2005-03-22 (14)) I saw this movie called Puke, which was a true story about a guy who got killed by a shark when he was on a pole and the shark jumped up and bit his head and then the shark died on the pole (it went through his middle). It was a hammerhead looking shark. I was telling Mom about it and I said that there was a real picture of it on the net of him, but I hadn't found it."
"0287"	"(2005-03-22 (14)) Mom and I were at a train station. She had to meet someone and lots of trains kept coming past. I almost got hit by one."
"0288"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at Mom's and we heard gunshots nearby so we started hiding our stuff. The people got to Mom's and were messing around at the top of the stairs and I was trying to get Mom to hide my bag. She did, but I ended up getting them out of the house. They were both girls by the way. Mom complained about me having so many animals. I had had a pet sheep called Aaron and I had also had a pig. The moon was big at 12 and when I got Mom to see, she thought I was playing a joke on her."
"0289"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at school and we had to do sports. Teacher-M-07 was our co-coordinator. No-one wanted to do sport though. There were SNSET people there and the teachers thought it wasn't fair for us, so when the SNSET people were gone we had to [I think SNSET's were speds] ."
"0290"	"(2005-03-24 (14)) I was at a shop. At first I was at an internet cafe with Ezra and Jayson, but I had no time left, so Mom and I went to the shop. There was an ice-cream shop and I was having a look and my tooth started hurting. I found Mom and I pulled my tooth out and it was a baby tooth. Farrah was on the floor being annoying. I didn't get an ice-cream. I was then at home in the bathroom and the doors were closed. Farrah and people from school were there too and we were hiding. Someone knocked on the door, so one girl was trying to get him away, and then I had to get rid of someone else. Later, a vet came; he was odd and was wearing weird clothes. I tried to tell him I didn't think any of our animals were sick but he decided to have a look anyway."
"0291"	"(2005-03-25 (14)) I was at Midvale shops except they now had a beach thing in the carpark. It had waves and stuff too. Ezra and I were getting into the car and I noticed all the water was gone. I didn't say anything and we got into the car. Valerie was there too, and she was with us and her and her kids wouldn't get in the car. I then realized all the water was built up in a huge wave. I screamed for Dad to get in the car but Ezra said ""We're gonna die aren't we?"" and I said ""Probably"" and then I decided I didn't wanna die so Dad got in the car and drove off before it was too late. We were safe. We went back though for some reason and it was all calm again, we went back home and everything was fine, but we realized it was happening again so we drove away. Then somehow I ended up in a car with Mom and we drove to this place that was causing the problem. They didn't do anything but they gave us a wireless computer mouse [my mouse stopped working last night] . We drove back again so that I could get my Monty Python DVD's and then it happened yet again and we drove downtown and I asked if we were going to stay at a hotel and we were. It was smelly though, and I was in the garden (it was night time) and there was a cubby house thing, and an old man, that looked like the 'It's' man, was or had told some boys to come up to prove their bravery. One boy did and the man told him to pretend he was getting hurt. So he started screaming and then his friends were laughing because they had set him up and then they had to jump off into this mud pit."
"0292"	"(2005-03-27 (14)) Ollie (Kingdom Hospital) was doing something. I can't remember properly but his last name was Skeckillson or something."
"0293"	"(2005-03-28 (14)) I was at the Royal Show. The first thing we saw was a ""Pat-the-Penguin"". It was a kangaroo in a penguin suit and we thought it was a penguin at first and then it was a person inside and we realized. I went to go into a separate part of the Royal Show. They said I had to be 15+ to go in by myself. But Mom came and I got in. It had all the waterslides and stuff. We left that bit and I went back and I was allowed in. I went into this toy shop and a lady from before said no people under 15 were allowed in. And she read out something about ""no smelly girls or boys under 15"". And I said I am 15. She said ""Oh. When's your birthday?"" and I said ""25 January 1990"". Then she asked me what term I was in. But I didn't get it at first. Then she asked when Baby Day was. I was like ""How should I know?"" Then I said today, because I had seen a poster with a mother and a baby. I was right. I was then backstage somewhere. I was there with some people from school. Also people were building a building over the water and Mom and I almost fell. Jocelyn and I were also walking around somewhere near the penguin thing. Also something someone had was ultra rare but I can't remember."
"0294"	"(2005-03-29 (14)) I was at some spooky place. People were coming back to life as zombies. I can't remember properly but Dad, Mom, Ezra and I and a few other people were the only live people left. We were wandering around looking for food and I ended up in a Thai restaurant. I went in and got some spaghetti in a bowl. I ate some but an evil person came and I hid under the table but he saw me. I 'paused' the game and he couldn't see me, but he stayed waiting and it wasn't actually a game. Anyway, somehow I got out and met up with Mom and company. We got to the gate and got out of the city. Then I said what if the gate was closed to keep them in. Then we heard them coming and we went to Nana's."
"0295"	"(2005-03-29 (14)) I was at school and some guy liked me. I can't remember much else, but I climbed up a hill and was at a house, and Nana lived there."
"0296"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) There was this house somewhere and I was there with some other people. There was Mom, Jayson and Ezra. It turned out that Jayson and I had had sex. Luckily, it was just implied. Anyway, I wasn't too worried about it and Mom was angry. Mom was trying to have a talk with me in this room. There was a poster on the bed, and Jayson was on one side of the bed, with a picture of Tinkerbell, and on the other side, a picture of Orlando Bloom. I hid next to the bed under the cover and Mom whacked me with a piece of wood to see if it was me, but it wasn't hard and I didn't move, so she decided I wasn't under there and then I popped out. I left the room and I walked past a room with a poster with 'Ugly Elephant Olyphant' on it. Timothy Olyphant was on it, and I thought it was hilarious for some reason. Then I heard a song playing on TV. It sounded like Red Dragon Tattoo, but then it sounded like Stacy's mother and it was Stacy's mother. The clip was before the small guy and Stacy had dated."
"0297"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) I was in a funeral car, and Mom was in another, and there were about 4-5 cars, I think. There was an accident, and my car got smashed. Then it was the past, and the survivors from the accident, and their child forms, came back to tell us and we avoided the accident."
"0298"	"(2005-03-30 (14)) I was wagging school and Dad, Ezra and Jayson came back from school. I dived under one blanket in a corner. Jayson was asking Dad some math question. Dad came into my room to explain it. He got on my computer and started trying to explain it to him. At one point, Dad dropped his phone right near me, but didn't notice me. I couldn't keep still though, and eventually Dad noticed I was under there."
"0299"	"(2005-04-01 (14)) Mom was getting married but I don't know who to. We had Tinkerbell, Tigger, Mittens, a dog and a bird in the car. Mittens was in the glove box. We had just come back to the car from somewhere. It was a hot day and Mittens needed water. Mom was telling me about when she got her wedding dress and how she didn't look very fat in it. Then we pulled up at some marriage motel thing. Mom told me the people liked playing jokes. We got there and there was a sign that said something like 'Don't park too close to the water'. A car was parked really close to the sign and then a lady ran out saying ""Oh, sorry!"" and she moved her car. It was a joke, but I didn't get it. We went inside and we were booking in or whatever and she said no cats were allowed, and then that no pets were allowed. Then she pulled out a fish, a cat and a dog. I said to Mom that it seemed weird that what she had pulled out were opposites of ours. I told the lady it was a joke and she was denying it and she left. Then her sister came in and let us up. The dog went behind the counter and she looked at us angrily and I thought she was going to say ""no dogs"", but she let us up. I was getting food for the dog when I noticed it was pooing and looked sick. I thought it was another joke so I went downstairs to ask them what their problem was, but I woke up."
"0300"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) Mom and I went on a train because Austin got two girls to go on it and she thought he was going to do something to them, so she gave the girls her keys to her car. Then she went to this car and jumpstarted it. I asked her why not use your car and she said she gave her keys to those girls. I got angry because my bag was in it. I walked around looking for the car but we didn't find it."
"0301"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) Mom picked me up from home to get food and I didn't wanna go to her house so she went to drop me off, but we walked through some scary park and some black guy was getting beaten up. I got home, which was very different. I was at Seabird and I ran down from the shops to the park. Nana was there and there were like 20 kittens which I had given birth to. They had names like 'Hungry'."
"0302"	"(2005-04-02 (14)) I was at work. Terry Jones was there and I know the other Monty Python guys were there, but I only remember Terry. He kept making faces. Anyway, work finished and I had to go to this 'buddy' place. I was buddies with this little girl with a strange voice. The buddy place was full of orphans, I think. Anyway, this little girl really liked me. She hadn't been there for a while, but she was there this time and she started climbing all over me. This other girl there, an older one, like me (she wasn't one of the orphans) had a video camera and she asked me to record some stuff. It only had 20 minutes of space on it. Later, I was looking up Monty Python stuff on the net and I found pictures of Michael Palin when he was younger."
"0303"	"(2005-04-03 (14)) It was like The 4400 and Ezra and I had both been taken. We were at some place with a big forest. Nana and Poppa were there. I think earlier on, but after we had come back, that I was at a place with Graham Chapman and we both had an ear infection. There was a little 8 year old girl, called Sara and she was dead but some strange thing was going on, and she was married to Graham and was also dating five others, including a Michael Palin gardener guy. But she was only 8 and I asked about this, but I didn't get a proper answer. She told me and Graham to put ear drops in our left ear, so we did. It made a strange noise, but it worked. This gardener bloke had been taken as well, I think. I was 'dating' the Michael Palin gardener and also a Michael Palin other person. Even though I had only been back a day or two. Earlier, we were (all the people that got taken) at this place and it had a big ball of light in the middle and it got smaller and smaller and then disappeared. Then we heard it would be back tonight at this little house thing. 1400 people were in the country by the way. I was walking up a hill with Dad, Ezra, Nana, Poppa and Mike Palin gardener. The other Mike Palin guy was there and said hi. Nana joked that I was dating them. I was, but she didn't know. When we walked back down, Nana said she was going to do something and then come to see the light. I was trying to work out what my power was. We got to the house. I got to the middle of the house and there was Ezra, Dad and I and some scary zombie-looking girl. The light appeared as a little squishy ball and it exploded. The 'camera' went bird's eye view and showed heaps of birds flying out of the forest."
"0304"	"(2005-04-04 (14)) I was 'watching' my dream with someone from school. I already knew what happened and I didn't want anyone else watching but they had to for some reason. Anyway, in this 'dream', Jayson and I were going out and we were making out or something. He got up and went somewhere. Later, I got up and chased Mittens down this hall and I discovered that he was in this room. That was the end of the 'dream'."
"0305"	"(2005-04-04 (14)) The girl next door was having a fit or something. I was out the front and there were police cars and an ambulance and they had those defibrillator things."
"0306"	"(2005-04-05 (14)) I was at school on the computers. It had Sims 2 on it. There was group of boys and they kept annoying Ramona, some girls and I. The teacher guy told us about this gay project we had to do, I only remember one part and we had to 'draw' ourselves, as babies. So I used Sims 2 bodyshop. I think later on in the dream we were running away from the boys and we got ice-creams, but I didn't get one."
"0307"	"(2005-04-06 (14)) I had a tank of pet fish in my room. It was quite a big tank and had many varieties of fish, including a seahorse and some little exciting ones. They kept jumping out of the tank and onto the floor, which was annoying. There was a big storm and it was scaring them. I told them something and they got into this big plastic thing, which was a safety defense shield thing. Then I had to guess the code."
"0308"	"(2005-04-06 (14)) Graham Chapman and I were good friends and I was on the net and I found pictures of him being alive after he died. I printed them out and left them so he would see them. These girls gave me a fake number plate. I knew it was a fake, but I put it on a car that I had. They said the speed goes up to 39kph. The number plate was 80, which meant I was speeding. They went off and I got in the car with Mom. We had to go in the Hyundai and I had to sit in the back, which I complained about. Ezra wanted to see Species 3. Later I was talking to Graham and 'confronted' him about the pictures, but he said he didn't know. Headlines from back then, said stuff like 'Dead doctor' and stuff."
"0309"	"(2005-04-07 (14)) I was at someone's house and I was out the back with some people and they found a leech. I was scared of it and they were throwing it around trying to get rid of it. It landed on my thumb and latched on. I was screaming and we tried everything to get it off, flinging, pulling, burning, but nothing worked. Nana came out of the house telling me to shut up and she got it off."
"0310"	"(2005-04-08 (14)) I was at some weird place that was near water. Food and stuff was really hard to get, but the place that I was at had a little shop/shed thing with trolleys full of stuff and we could take them. Jayson, Ezra, Mom, Dad and Jayson' made up sister were there. Her name was Marie and she looked like Mary from Kingdom Hospital. She liked me a lot. Anyway, we went down to the shed and we got a trolley, which was ours and we had to climb to get it. When we walked out there were some people nearby and they were going to kill us, or at least damage us, but we ran away, this happened twice, and the third time there was this nice black guy who gave us our stuff and a diary of a girl who had died and disappeared. Then strange things started happening. As we were walking to this place, coming back from the shed, I was seeing everything in black and white, but everything behind me was in colour. We walked onto this platform and Marie started talking to me as her mother, and she told me that I had turned into her mother. This strange thing went away and when I was still like that I said ""No, it's me Izzy"" and she said ""Oh, Jayson' girlfriend"" and I said ""Who's girlfriend? I'm not a girlfriend"". She said something like ""It seems like it"". Jayson was in some place and he was skinny. Later on, I was on this jetty thing, and these guys were going to kill me and there was a 'magical' thing that happened and it happened now -- a bit of water rained from nowhere and I quickly ran to get away and a wave got the bad people. It also happened later, but this time I barely got away and it was a train that went past."
"0311"	"(2005-04-08 (14)) The things from Predator had come to Earth, but they couldn't go invisible and they didn't have the heat vision. Anyway, they would search houses for people and kill them or take them with them. They were on our street and Dad told me to hide in his cupboard underneath all these clothes. I did, but then they got to our house and they took Dad and Ezra with them. One (I think only one came in) opened the cupboard, but he didn't see me, but he somehow sensed I was in there and I got up and was running away from him. He got sick of running, I suppose, and went back to the ship but I realized he was going to blow the house up, so I ran into the shed and then I heard an explosion. The house was still standing though. The predator bloke had a look and happy with the results, he left the house and told the rest not to search the house again. Then they flew away. I was going to jump the fence to leave, but there was an evil dog. I went next door and they were in a caravan thing and they were going to leave. I knocked on the door and I said it was us (Ezra was with me now). They didn't believe us, and this guy said ""What does Izzy like?"" So I said ""waffle, chicken"" and Ezra said ""guns"" and they said ok and let us in. The caravan was full of people and it was really squishy inside. Granma was in there. We got to a park and there were horse races and we tried to warn everyone about the aliens but no-one believed us."
"0312"	"(2005-04-09 (14)) I knew Johnny Knoxville and he, his other mates and I went to some shop and they were going to steal a bottle of water. They did and then ran off laughing. Then I was at school, and there was going to be a song or play thing. I was first in so I got to sit in the front row. We had to sit on the floor though. Mom, Dad and Ezra were sitting next to the stage. I also knew Graham Chapman, who was appearing in this play. I don't know what they did, but at the end they were singing 'Every Sperm is Sacred' and I was the only one in the audience who knew the words. After, I went to see Mom who was talking to a sports teacher. She said ""You're the only kid I've met who likes Monty Python"". I was chatting to her and Mom and then the sports teacher said she liked the way I talk. Then in sport, she said she thought it would be best for me if I taught myself. Later, Johnny Knoxville and I went to a shop and stole another bottle of water and also we had ordered a cows brain and had eaten a little bit of it as a joke."
"0313"	"(2005-04-11 (14)) I was at some place and I was watching a live Monty Python thing on the TV. Terry Jones kept stuffing up his lines. In the water there was this shark thing and Stan from South Park was underneath it; the shark was protecting him. The shark swam away and he came up for air, holding his hat and he was covered in mud."
"0314"	"(2005-04-13 (14)) Mom and I were at a friend of hers' place and he got bitten and turned into a zombie. So we got out of there, and I ended up at school. People were turning into zombies there too. I was running from different rooms with Farrah and a girl I made up. We were running around, ending up in places like the gym, running down a hall, back to the gym. We ended up in an apartment type room. There were three beds and knives and things in the drawers. We put the mattresses on the floor."
"0315"	"(2005-04-14 (14)) I was at a park or something. There was a competition on and there were 10 men and they all had a partner. For some reason, I ended up as some guys' partner. I was walking along and someone gave me a golf club. The competition was supposed to be hard, but I must have done well because the guy told me someone had said he was in the lead. Cuddles also had her kittens, nine were in trios and there were more. We were leaving the park place and we went up a carpark and at the top people were being all evil."
"0316"	"(2005-04-21 (14)) We went to 'Seabird'. There were two caravans. Mom was there and we were going to share the bigger caravan. Nana owned them or something. There was also a boy, who was a serious computer addict. He lived in this room, which was stacked high with games and other computer things. We went to the big caravan, which was messy. I went to the bedroom and turned around and screamed. A room on the left side had been one which I had dreamed the Zelda person (The lady from 217 in The Shining remake) was in and I was seeing things. It was really scary. We ended up in a small cabin looking outside because there was something evil out there."
"0317"	"(2005-04-27 (14)) The kids from The Sound of Music and the nanny came to stay with us. They were dressed in old fashion clothes. We were all mucking around, pulling pranks on people. There were strange sheep somewhere."
"0318"	"(2005-04-29 (14)) I cleaned up Mom's backyard, but how you would a desktop, by clicking and dragging. There was some strange movie with me and Jayson and we had kissed but I didn't remember it. I also looked at school photos. I left to tell Mom about the backyard, it was still very messy, but when we went out it was clean."
"0319"	"(2005-04-30 (14)) We were on a boat, I think, and we crashed, but I don't remember it. I was at some place, with the guys from Monty Python, and we were friends. We all had to climb this strange thing (like that game at the Royal Show, when you climb up a blown up thing, but it always tips over) and then press or grab something. If this bird cuckooed then we won heaps of money. We climbed up and after a certain time, it makes you fall. Terry Jones was running the whole show, but he was also climbing, so I think maybe he had a look-alike. He was falling and somehow I pressed mine and his button thing, not at the same time. I won $1.4 million. Then I was playing Neopets and it was money that I had on there. Then I had it in real life again."
"0320"	"(2005-04-30 (14)) I was at some place that looked like Nana's. Ron, Harry and Hermione (Harry Potter) were there, as was I. Ron, Harry and I were under the invisibility cloak. I don't know why and Harry and Ron both liked Hermione, I think maybe only Harry. Harry ended up going out with her."
"0321"	"(2005-05-01 (14)) The sequel to XXX had Vin Diesel in it. He went down a pipe, getting away from these bad guys. Then he ended up dressing as a girl and was staying in an all girls house thing. He had a lesbian relationship with some girl and then he had to run away."
"0322"	"(2005-05-01 (14)) I was walking to Brookland High School, which took ages. There was a big scary pool."
"0323"	"(2005-05-08 (14)) There were zombies (Dawn of the Dead orig.). I knew the blokes from Monty Python and Graham Chapman had been bitten and was in bed, sick. He was turning into a zombie and for some reason some things would make the people turning into a zombie, go crazy. A chicken wandered into the room and from its view, it was all bulgy and reddish. Graham went psycho, turning into a zombie and then eventually calming down. He ended up dying. I also remember that when people bit someone's finger, they would turn into a zombie. We were at someone's house, and it was scary. I wagged school and was hiding behind a tree and Dad saw me."
"0324"	"(2005-05-11 (14)) I was at the Royal Show. For some reason, in my dreams you need a parent to get in the 'water' only parts. Mom and Ezra were already in, but they wouldn't let me in, even when Mom came to get me. David Mathew was in the dream somewhere."
"0325"	"(2005-05-12 (14)) I was swapping 'my' room around. I was moving the bed, which was basically the only thing in there. In the rest of the house there was Dawn of the Dead orig. zombies everywhere. I was going about killing them. I think David Mathew was in this dream too. I think I was trapping some zombies in cages. I also think I had a boyfriend or some romantic relationship with someone."
"0326"	"(2005-05-15 (14)) I was walking home from school and I put my bag on the island across from the logs. I did this because Mom came and picked me up. I then realized it was gone. I was really upset because my phone was in it and so were a lot of other things. We went back and it wasn't there, then it ended up in the middle of the donut, in front of the house across from the logs. I then left it there. I ended up with my phone later and I wondered why I had it. I was jumping fences with someone and there were rabbits."
"0327"	"(2005-05-18 (14)) I was on a weird boat thing. I was married to David Mathew. There were some kids at a bridge, and they destroyed it. We got trapped on the boat. There was a party going on and they all chucked a spaz. There was also a pregnant woman. It went birds eye view at one point and it looked Sims 2 like."
"0328"	"(2005-05-18 (14)) I was at this school place, which was sort of barn looking. Jayson and I were in the same class, and we liked each other. The teacher was also gay (not homosexual). Jayson and I both said ""Burma!"" at the same time. We were both sitting at the back of the class."
"0329"	"(2005-05-21 (14)) The Royal Show was next to a big shop. Me, Ezra and Jayson went to the shop. My mobile was out of credit, Ezra's had no power and Jayson didn't have his. We also had no money. The bus guy said it would cost us $1.30 for all of us to go on the bus. Jayson ended up running away to go find Mom. Then Ezra caught a taxi and I wouldn't go because we had no money. I was saying ""We're looking for the Royal Show"", and all of a sudden it was in front of me and all of the show was on this railway and it was moving to get back to its proper spot. I jumped on. I met this lady who was married to Marlon Brando before he was in The Godfather. There was also this hot guy on board, who I think was Greg Mathew."
"0330"	"(2005-05-26 (14)) I was on a motorbike and someone else was driving. Then I was driving and it started raining. It was really heavy rain and I couldn't see. We crashed and both passed out. There was a steep drop near a two storey shopping centre. I landed on the top of the step, and the other person landed on the bottom one. It was then not wet, and it was all sunny and stuff. There were a few people around, but they were shady looking. This person and I jumped on a hovercraft thing, as did Ezra and Jayson and then the shady people started shooting at us. We got pretty far and then the hovercraft stopped. We ended up at a house thing with weird rooms. I had to share with some friend of Ezra's but I didn't want to."
"0331"	"(2005-05-28 (14)) I was at a freaky place with these weird boats and people could float around in them. Greg Mathew was there with me and we went around the back (to leave the boat, and it was all dark and spooky). There was a dance and some girl was being a bitch and complaining because someone was wearing the same clothes as her. Also there was a new law, and I can't remember what it was, but it was gay."
"0332"	"(2005-05-29 (14)) There was some species/game thing called Protpets. There was this thing called Zanuzez, and it liked me and I liked it. This lady had come to school with lots of these pet things. The Zanuzez thing kept growing and it ended up turning into this ferret thing. Anyway, we were all supposed to get one to catch more. There was some sport thing going on. Jake was there and something 'bad' happened. I think Jake and this other little noob got bashed. There was also this little sports cabin."
"0333"	"(2005-05-31 (14)) I won something at school, and I was allowed 'nomination' points. This kid in class got in trouble and the teacher was trying to get him to give her something like $10,000, so I let him off with the points. I was then at some evil park. There were these evil haunted ghost dudes and it was raining and Mom took me on this trolley thing around the park. The ghost dudes threw stuff at me. Moondyne Joe was the name of one of them. MJ was also the coach of the soccer team, which I then played a bit of. I stole $10,000. I wanted the money and this guy took something else. There was also something about a dog with a cockroach. Also, at home there were some people after us and I tried to get away but when we went back home they were there."
"0334"	"(2005-06-06 (14)) I only remember a bear chase and a weird, munted shed."

"0336"	"(2005-06-10 (14)) I went to school in my pajamas. I had a hotel room. Jayson was at school and we were talking to some people. Then Ezra, Jayson and I were hiding from Mom in this nest thing, but it didn't work and she found us. A horse asked for a horse. There were lots of plates. I had to kill some little kid."
"0337"	"(2005-06-11 (14)) I was at some place, which had a bin full of pies. There was a pie-eating contest."
"0338"	"(2005-06-11 (14)) I was in Bali, and only Bali people were allowed to food after 5pm. I was there with school. I was in the bath watching Mr and Ms Smith. There was a wasp like the one from Donkey Kong Country. I was also at these netball courts and I sat around. There was a big K-Mart and a McDonald's nearby. Mr Nixon was around."
"0339"	"(2005-06-13 (14)) I had three kids. Their father was Jack Nicholson. I was about 15, but somehow they aged and I was still 15, but I wasn't. The oldest was a girl, sometimes she looked like that ugly Tanita girl, other times she was pretty and sometimes she had this scary nose. The second oldest was also a girl, and the youngest was a boy. We were playing on some big oval. When my eldest met Mom, I was 'overjoyed' and she was nervous about meeting Mom."
"0340"	"(2005-06-21 (14)) Those ugly dudes Harlan and Elijah were being gay saying loudly that no-one liked me. I can't remember what happened but I annoyed them back at some point."
"0341"	"(2005-06-24 (14)) I was at school and Teresa, the others and I were getting along pretty well. Mr Nixon said that I needed to talk to others more and that after school I had to go to his house. He drove me there in silence. His house was in the middle of nowhere and it was huge. It was all Timezone like inside; there were games everywhere. Some person was shooting. There was some letter and someone read it and it was something about Mr Nixon and some park. I got McDonald's."
"0342"	"(2005-06-25 (14)) There were these trees, and this Green Traveller (Flesh and Blood) dude was trying to kill me and some people. They were chasing us around and turning into robots. We escaped and hid in this house and turned all the lights off, and closed all the curtains. One person left for school and the trees, as humans, followed her. These bullies tried to stop them."
"0343"	"(2005-06-27 (14)) I had a pet pig called Porky. It was very evil and only liked Mom. We kept it in a cage. Mom and I went to this place, which had a human path and an animal path, which was all cagey and had bridges and stuff. She let the pig loose and I ran way ahead, but then I didn't know where to go. I was on a bridge and the pig caught up and tried to get me. Mom gave it a pat. It worked out how to get on the bridge so I bolted for the door on the other side. It had no lock and the pig could open doors. The light switch was on the door handle. The door turned into a sheet and the pig bit my foot, it hurt and I screamed. These people with guns shot the hell out of the pig, but it was still alive and now it was upset. I ran upstairs into a little room. I was trapped and there were zombies outside of the room. There were lots of Cuddles looking cats, but they all had different coloured eyes, which were all bright."

A grandpa of mine in the future (ie the present) was looking for generations of his family. Then we were somewhere else and they had this thing where you had to walk on this rope to get across the water. One of the guys looked like Jack Lemmon, and he and my other friend started singing. I found some videos and photos of me when I was little. There was this scary green dude in the basement of some old lady's house."
"0352"	"(2005-07-09 (14)) I went to the movies and took my favourite jumper (my Golden Breed one) and I put it on the seat next to me. I walked out of the cinema and then I remembered about it. I went back to get it, but it was gone. A jacket was there that looked just like it."
"0353"	"(2005-07-09 (14)) We went to Valerie's house and she had this munted llama with a munted nose. We were in the car. Ezra left a note asking about Christmas and said to send him a letter and something about fire. Valerie's boobs were hanging out of her shirt and she was all blotchy."

"0356"	"(2005-07-12 (14)) I went back in time to 1959 in England. It was really old fashioned except they had this really futuristic looking McDonald's. I met this professor who was, but wasn't, Christopher Lloyd. I was talking to him and I said something about me coming from the future. He showed me his time machine. These people were killing other people. Someone died in this cave and other people went in to find them. I went in to find those people and they were all gone. This annoying girl was asking me questions about my country."

I saw Michael Palin and his wife (Helen Gibbins) talking (they were our age). There was a voiceover saying that no-one liked them. He walked down to where I was, and I tried talking to him, but he was really quiet and shy. All of our classes changed and they wouldn't change them back. The dance teacher had really hairy legs with black hair."

My sister was a Farrah look-alike and I saw her go into a room. She met with this guy who looked like Carson. For some reason, I forgot to look around and I went into my secret room to meet with a guy who I think was Calvin. Farrah caught me, but I had already caught her."
"0363"	"(2005-07-28 (14)) I was at a shop and this weird dude was following us. He was really mean and rude. There was a Sims 2 competition."

The tide started coming in and we moved everything up and also put some stuff into a house like Nana's, but it had different furniture. Nana kept coming to the island in a little speedboat acting weird. There was something about shortcake sea water? Something broke and the water came to the house, then I was watching it as a movie and it was The Beatles, not us. They left the house and then the camera focused on Darren, and they were walking through a forest and they got shot at. Then it was the people from Lost. Jack and Kate were talking."
"0367"	"(2005-08-11 (14)) Mom was taking me and Ezra to school, but she didn't. We ended up at some place where they were going to kill this puppy. Ezra saved it somehow with a rope."

The lady served mashed potatoes to the police."

Ezra and I went in car and locked the doors. The window was now fixed. I said ""What if someone is in the boot?"" so I got out to find Mom. There was a creepy kid at the ATM. Two guys came towards me, so I got back in the car. Then I saw that the boot was open and a creepy robber, like the one in Little Britain, was walking off. Mr Ripley and Mr Nixon were security guards. Mr Gutenberg was hanging around too. They stayed with us. The cameras watched you when you looked at someone. There was an evil old lady.

These people snuck me into the place because Calvin wanted to talk to me. Then I was in a car with Mom and it was night time. These people broke into somewhere. And there were weird religious people."

"0381"	"(2005-09-02 (14)) Jayson stayed the weekend. On Saturday there was something happening at school. Jayson was on the phone to his mother, saying a poem so that he could stay another night. He came to the school and we had to wear uniforms and he sat next to me, but a bit further away. Calvin came and sat next to me. We were talking and I pointed to Jayson and I told him who he was. Then he started to get angry for some reason and kept leaning on me. There was a concert on and Mom said that Green Day was going to be there, so we went. Green Day came on, and when they left, we left and we got food."
"0382"	"(2005-09-04 (14)) This nasty teacher made the class line up. I started singing 'Love Me Tender' under my breath and then Calvin joined in, and then the whole class. I was then at some place running around trying to get away from this black kid in a wheelchair. I went into this news agency earlier, and the kid was there. He followed me to the deli and by mistake, a strip club. He didn't need a wheelchair though [he was like Andy from Little Britain] . There was some magician guy on the stage.

"0384"	"(2005-09-07 (14)) There was a school ball or something. I just wore my normal casual clothes. Jake and some other boys were wearing this weird suit, which had a blue 'top' thing. Some of the girls had pink ones. Calvin came and he got changed into his school shirt. He sat near me and kept leaning on me. There was this pretty girl at some place who I was talking to and getting along with. Calvin started spending time with her so I left. Ms Doubtfire was sitting in 'class'. Calvin sat at the opposite end of the table and was talking to me. He moved next to me and he 'realized' that I was annoyed that he had been spending time with the girl. I had also seen them holding hands at one stage. Calvin started laughing and teasing me because I thought that 'they were going out'. I kept denying it, although it was true. I was mainly annoyed that the girl had stopped being friends with me."

This guy came and said everything that the person had told me earlier, again, and he then ripped his face (mask) off. He gave us two packs of sausages. We left as the people were coming. We snuck around this building which was a two storey, motel type building. A woman punched some woman when she opened the door. Some guy asked us what we saw. I said nothing and he let us go.

I got the wrong bit of paper. I ran back. Somehow inside, Harlan had sticky tape. He and his friends tied me up on this bed. I got out of it and I went back to the gym. The lady waiting started writing on my leg ""Dear Izzy, something (I don't remember) ice cool and red hot"". Greg was with her. Dave came over and they both signed the bit of paper."

"0395"	"(2005-09-18 (14)) I was playing Fate, except it was real life. Some people were in the dungeon. They didn't finish the tutorial. I jumped over this thing and people followed.

I went off with someone and we went to the park thing at night time. Then I was running away from something. I went back to the house and they asked me where I had been (it had been 2 days, although for me it had only been a couple of minutes).

We did whatever we had done a second time, but our heads just went bigger. I went to school. There was a pool thing with waves. A beaver was following me. My head shrunk back to normal over time.

Some teacher told me to tie my hair back. I said no. Evelyn was doing some juice advertisement. There was two of her. There was an assembly for Year 9 and 10. The amount of people only looked like the size of one year. The school was bushy and was on an island thing surrounded by water. Mom picked me up and I had to climb down a ladder."

They had dug deep and found all this stuff underneath. The fat girl was angry because I had said something like ""You're cool and pretty"". You could climb down the hole as there was a ladder on the side. I had to drive up this road to find them, but then it was a dude was driving up some road. His father was in this big area flying a plane in circles, on the ground, because of some accident. The father told the guy to move. The father crashed with two dogs except they turned into babies.

The cop was angry. He got everyone to line up on this ledge. He threatened to throw a snowball. I was close to him and he threw it while looking at me and I ducked and fell into the water. He had aimed at another person on the ledge behind me, which was a bit higher. Calvin was next to me and I whispered for him to move. He got away, but the cop let everyone off. Later, I was in a spooky shop where there were lots of Goosebumps books. The cop kept picking on me. This scary dude got Calvin, Silas and Samantha. The cop took me to some strange place with monkeys. There was a pool thing and I didn't want to get in. He looked like Tim Brunero when we were there."

The boys and I picked all black. This guy came and he thought we were the proper 'astronaut' people. He believed us, until he asked me how my 'Dad' was, as he was sick. I said ""Uh... yeah, I dunno,"" and then he got his buddies and they put us in this car. We got transferred to another car, and Dad was driving it. Jayson didn't sit in the car though, he held onto the door from outside. When Dad stopped, he jumped off and ran, but Dad let us go too. Calvin and I left and we ran and hid behind these trees. But the people saw and took us again. Then we were at some place with water, which had evil fish. These people would call someone out and they had to stay in the water and get back to their spot to win, or if they got bit 5 times, or 20 times, they could get out. I got called and I got bitten. At the end, someone random would get thrown in to die. Some person pointed out some Beatles stuff, so I went to look at it. Dad got a job as a design person at school."
"0412"	"(2005-10-05 (14)) I had 8 kids. Their father, who I think was Michael Palin, lived in a little house with all the kids. I barely saw them and didn't remember giving birth, being pregnant or having sex. I went over one day and all the kids were toddlers. I didn't like them because they had gay names, one was Deshantal and another was Michelle. Michelle somehow remembered me."
"0413"	"(2005-10-05 (14)) I went to some random school and I was going out with a teacher. There was a take-away pizza place across the road. I lost my bag, and there was an evil principal."
"0414"	"(2005-10-06 (14)) There was a little house in space and some dude turned small and green to get in, and in his house, which was mansion-like, had books with the answers to everything. I was pregnant and I looked at a book thing which said I was having twins called Peter and Peggy, but they were black and then they were Sims and their father was Joe Carr. I was at a shop, one day before the kids were due. My water broke while I was in the carpark so I went to the hospital. Mom thought I was naming the kids Jayson and Kate. I had them 'cut' out and the scar bit was an ad on TV. There were pipes and people underwater on the ad too. I wanted to name the kids, first name and middle name, Jessica Madison and Adam Michael because their father was Michael Palin."
"0415"	"(2005-10-07 (14)) I was Seabird and the cabins were like huts and really stingy. There were chickens wandering around. I was at school and it was in a shop or something. I was in class and I had just finished drawing a picture of an ad with Calvin. I went to the desk and Isabel sat in front. She started drawing in one my Logic Problems books. I got angry and chucked a spaz and Jayson was there. Then I saw that my drawing was ruined. Isabel said ""Is it late?"" and I was like ""What?"" I was wearing a skirt and I had my period. In the classroom, a phone rang."
"0416"	"(2005-10-09 (14)) I was at school and we would get points for doing stuff. The same people were always finishing. My group was going to cook. I went to the teachers' kitchen and it was all dark. There was this killer guy who was a black cop. He stabbed me, but it didn't do anything. I got him in the head. He was handing out Freddo's to people. I met some people going to a lolly shop. There was a cinema, which seemed to never end -- at the front of the room with the screen, there was a door which led to another room. This crazy killer dude did a crazy dance. I was at 'home', and this guy was pulling a tree up and it exploded. I ended up in Canada, and then I walked to Germany and then to Spain. I saw Dad in a place called 'Broken Cord' or something. There was a dog breeding ground."
"0417"	"(2005-10-13 (14)) I woke up with a bit of a headache. My hair went full curly. Dad's room was scary looking and orange and I thought he and Ezra were high. Dad kept saying to Ezra that he wanted my room. They were talking about TV shows including A Bit of Fry and Laurie and others. Dad complained about me going psycho the night before. I didn't remember. I had had a dream about soccer balls. I went to school and I met up with Calvin, Fang and Evelyn. Fang had a chocolate version of Operation. It got stolen. Jake and someone else thought that I was a guy. The teachers were acting weird. There were lots of soccer balls. I started walking around at home later, and I was screaming and hitting someone to try and wake myself up. What had happened the night before had happened again. This woman that Dad was going out with said that I'd died, while I slept. I tried to work out how to save myself again. I was in a taxi and the taxi driver was a guy. KA PLEEZ was written somewhere in the taxi."
"0418"	"(2005-10-15 (14)) I went shopping with Mom. We were in a little shop with lots of DVDS. People were shopping in the main shop so it was quiet where we were. They had The Shining remake, but it was different. In the movie, the house was little-ish and a guy went there. On floor 217 there was a creepy monster. In the house, there was cat food and lots of water. Two guys went to check this cat in the bath."
"0419"	"(2005-10-15 (14)) I somehow ended up in a new galaxy or planet. People looked slightly different. I ended up with a group of people. I remember Erik Stolhanske, Paul Soter and Sam (from Club Dread, who is played by Erik Stolhanske). Sam was the first one I'd met, and he was really nice. This killer dude was around. Some of the group got bitten by a werewolf. We had to leave them. There were then 6 of us. I got in the car with Sam. We drove away and then the car stalled. The killer came and killed him. I ran off back to the other car. I was in the back with Erik, who was also nice. Paul died at some house. Erik was saying how he ""wanted us to be together"" but we couldn't because I was going and he was on a different planet."
"0420"	"(2005-10-16 (14)) I was in a car with Calvin and some people. We were trying to get away from bad people. The car stopped working. The bad guys took one person. I was at a place, and I went into a little shop but I had no money. I sold newspapers and I was going to buy water but I stuffed up. Calvin went in there and asked for water. Water was hard to get. This lady in the shop wondered why we'd been hanging around. I was then in this water and this crocodile was trying to get me. I got over a fence and some dude said ""Aint it dead yet?"""
"0421"	"(2005-10-17 (14)) Children of the Corn 3 type of movie. Eli, his 'mother' and 'father' were the same people. The father started bashing Eli at the end of the movie. They had a boat and it was sinking. I think the father died. This guy called David came on. First it was Brad Pitt, then David from 40 Year Old Virgin. The narrator was saying that he was the town hero, and then he went crazy. He ended up in a mental hospital. There was a song playing called ""St Elmo's Fire"". There was something about Jesus. David had a split personality and his other half was called Robert Larry. There was apple crumble."

I needed to change so I went looking for a toilet. I found a cinema so I asked if I could use the toilet. They said I could. I went upstairs and there was a person doing work and I had to crawl over the table. I ended up in a house with no toilet. The house kept changing which had something to do with a time warp."
"0423"	"(2005-10-19 (14)) I was at school and I had a car. Calvin was around. I was then at home and the people from across the road and Classmate-M-23 were outside the front door, playing. I kept telling them to go away, but they didn't. I went out and kicked one of them in the balls. I did it again to another person too. I came out later, and the guys mother and father came in a Toyota. The mother was telling me off and I was yelling back. The father came inside looking for something. I asked who she was and I realized he was going to steal stuff, so I put him outside. The LAN cord wasn't connected."
"0424"	"(2005-10-20 (14)) I was at a place with Calvin and he had a little sister called Sunny. At first it wasn't me and Calvin, it was two people and they were in a Lord of the Flies situation and they had their own plates to sit on. I had a tree full of food and something else. I got Sunny to bury a bag before some man came. When she got up to us, she was older. We got caught by some dudes. They had powers. Some persons father could fly and do stuff with birds. Their mother could smash rocks and stuff. We were supposed to have powers too."
"0425"	"(2005-10-21 (14)) Ezra, Dad and I went to a McDonalds and we were tired. Ezra passed out and Dad said ""Great, I've got to take Ezra out"". Then he said the same thing about me. I said ""I haven't passed out yet"". He said ""Yes you have"" and then I passed out. Then we were in the carpark and we had two cars. I said to Dad, ""I think you're dreaming"". He was. Then some scary thing jumped up and screamed (as if I was watching a movie). It woke me up."
"0426"	"(2005-10-21 (14)) I was in the haunted woods and there was this crazy dude who killed some people on the 4-wheeler. I got on the 4-wheeler and drove away from him. He died. I was at school and in class with Jake, Chriss and Silas and we all had tapes. They put theirs on and they all had the same songs. I put mine and on and it played ""The Birds and the Bees"" and they were ok and first, until he started singing and they chucked a spaz because it was old. The voice was old sounding."
"0427"	"(2005-10-22 (14)) I was at a shop and Evelyn and Fang worked there. Simon Pegg was there and some woman got his autograph for me."

I managed to escape. Water was going to 'appear' at some place. There had been a drought? The water made stuff green. Mr Nixon was or had a snake with no mouth or colour.

"0430"	"(2005-10-26 (14)) I was at some place with the school. We got school photos. They went through this machine which was shady looking. The bus driver was Erik Stolhanske, but not as hot. Some dude wanted me to change his timetable. There was a computer. There was a restaurant and it had beds and those baby things. This person had a dragon, as did I, but mine all had gay eyes. The bus driver was in a helicopter and he said no-one could come with him. But then he drove the bus. Some dude was shooting me because he thought that I was a thief."
"0431"	"(2005-11-01 (14)) I was at a park and there were lots of people from school there. There was a tube, which was extremely popular and I wanted to play in it, but it was always full. One time it wasn't but I was too big to go in it."

"0434"	"(2005-11-04 (14)) I was at a shop with Mom and Dad. Dad was going to buy me something expensive. I saw an egg-chair and it was cool and blue or silver. It was $300 odd. It came with a big monitor and a cool game and stuff. Mom said that she'd buy it. There was some show thing and Dad almost fell. Some dude did fall. He was the producer of the game. James Matheson bought the rights to the game and some friends and I went to this place. It was pretty much empty. James said that he wasn't going to finish making the game because he wanted to be famous for music. I said just finish this. He said he wouldn't but on TV, he said he would."
"0435"	"(2005-11-06 (14)) I was at home except it was like a mansion. The main Saved by the Bell characters were there and paired up. The blonde one said something about having both guys. I was with Ryan Cartwright. We were in bed in this room. Mom kept coming in and telling us not to do anything naughty. We had wine and we tried to get the cork through the window, but it missed. We started drinking it, but then Ryan kissed me. While we were 'asleep', these ghosts were buying dresses and other girls clothes. I was at some place and I was trying to get out, but there were all these snakes in the way. I fell and a big snake licked my face. There were 'space' games at this place. Ezra went on a cart to get $100."

We were playing this game with these people and we had two thingies, which I think were Pokemon. They had Harry Potter and Runescape though. I got rid of one thing because of a card. I learnt spells and it turned into checkers because they gave up. Ezra and I ended up in a strange snowy place. There were bad people. I threw a snowball at them and then we ran off. We ended up in Midvale, across from the shops. We walked to the shops. The bad people followed and we ran into the liquor store and hid in the fridge. A guy came in and I bashed him."
"0437"	"(2005-11-08 (14)) I was at a hotel in the Gold Coast. Ezra and I were in an Unfabulous play. I was Zack and Ezra was someone I made up.

The bathroom door was open. I went to tell the lady, but she had been killed. No-one could see the killer except for me, and two friends of mine -- Ryan Cartwright and someone.

Dad and I went on this Giant Drop type of ride, but two lots of people go up on the same rail, on the same side. I pressed something to make it go down, but people were going up. I couldn't stop it, but the ride operator stopped it, just as we hit the top. I saw this other ride but we didn't go on it because of our experience with the last ride."
"0440"	"(2005-11-11 (14)) Ezra and I went looking for this puppy because it had been stolen and no-one had been able to find it. We went into this room in an apartment and we found it.

The show was cool. The Hitler guy from Dracula's was in it. I had a shower and then I found out that a taxi was going to pick us up to go to a restaurant.

There was a part of the movie about these people from the future. One of them was bad at math, but was good with decimals. They knew that he was getting killed on 8th December at 8.00pm though it changed to 10.00pm. They were out partying and they got reminded of saving him ten minutes before it was going to happen. John Lennon was taped talking to people after he had just got off a boat and it was daytime. Then shown was John signing Mark David Chapman's book to 'Peter Milk'. Then he came back later and one of the people there cried out ""Look out!"". He mumbled it as if questioning it and then turned around to see Chapman standing there with his hand in his jacket. It was cold and you could see their breath. He pulled out a gun and said ""I may be gay but you are great,"" and as John turned to run he shot him and he said ""I'm shot,"" and collapsed on the stairs [when he fell the camera was actually him falling, like in A Clockwork Orange when Alex jumps out the window] . The stairs he collapsed on came down upon each other and John got squished. By the time, Yoko Ono and the others got there he was long gone. His feet were sticking out and the last part showed Chapman going through files about him. I was watching it with Mom and our eyes were both teary. She went away and I watched it again. I was really upset and crying. Mom said ""I understand but get over it"". [I woke up from this dream crying, and was really depressed for the whole day.] Later I was somewhere else and this dude asked if anyone liked any celebrities that had died before we were born. Mom said ""She [me] does!"" and he asked me when. I said ""Ten years, four months after August 7 1970"" and he couldn't work it out. He was the decimal dude."
"0472"	"(2005-12-24 (14)) I was at a restaurant and so were The Beatles. Calvin was there. He came over and said hello. Ramona, Tiana and I had a sleepover in car. Some girl took my shoes."
"0473"	"(2005-12-24 (14)) Calvin and I were going out. Silas and Samantha were hugging and Calvin put his arm around me."
"0474"	"(2005-12-24 (14)) I was at a new school which had three 'storeys' of chairs. I sat somewhere but I moved. Charlene was there. It was still year 7. Evelyn was there too. There was a shop at school for lost furniture sets."
"0475"	"(2005-12-24 (14)) I was friends with this guy. I liked him and he liked me too, although he didn't show it. This girl, who was going out with this other guy, kept having sex with him. I can't remember the first time, but the next time was at the girl's house. We ran up to the top floor attic thing. And they had sex. The girl ran down as we were walking. She mouthed 'barbie' and her father said something about sausages. I called Mom to pick me up. The guy fell down in an elevator. I couldn't find the lid for the water bottle."
"0476"	"(2005-12-27 (14)) A war was happening. I got separated from Mom. I got away from these people who had captured me. Things were blown up. There was a building still intact, and I went in. I think me and these people were being held there. I wanted to leave. My Gamecube was there and we were packing our stuff up and leaving."
"0477"	"(2005-12-28 (14)) I was friends with Zim (Invader Zim). He was really small. His ship had been found and some people and I went in there. We got locked in one part of it, and other people got us out. Zim chucked a spaz and I was holding him. He grew to the size of a human."
"0478"	"(2005-12-28 (14)) We were on holiday and I was at this restaurant. I think I was with Zim (Invader Zim) and he was blind. They started closing except they let us stay and then The Beatles came, though George was there and I didn't know why. Paul was, but wasn't, a girl. They said they were going to be there and George had pyjamas, a marker etc. I talked to them for a while and then I ran to shops for some paper but none of the shops had any and these bridges were delayed, and I needed to use the bridges to get from place to place. I finally got to a hotel and it was the wrong one and there was an evil person. Dad was in the pool. I got keys. The Beatles had gone when I got back."
"0479"	"(2005-12-30 (14)) We went somewhere and there was a barbeque shop, which I remembered seeing in a dream. People from school were staying in a motel. I knocked on Daryl's door and I ran around the building. He ran too, but he didn't see me and I got back to my room, which I was sharing with other people. He checked in the room and I screamed and fell. I was recording stuff. We were watching Back to the Future 2 and I remember seeing Michael J. Fox. Then we had an assembly. Nana was there and we watched Mary Poppins."
"0480"	"(2006-01-01 (14)) I could watch dreams, so I was watching them and most of mine were all spoken in 'gobbledegook'. We used the red, white and yellow cords to watch them. The dream I watched was set in the Gold Coast and there was a bomb in the room where I worked, but it was fake. Some girl drove to her home and then I wanted to go home, but she was evil."
"0481"	"(2006-01-02 (14)) Mom 'had' King Kong as a pet. It was friendly to Mom, sometimes friendly to me, but he hated Ezra. It got angry and started chasing us."
"0482"	"(2006-01-03 (14)) I was at school and it was really weird and like Hogwarts. Someone said that it was a 'magic' school. There were big waves and me and two guys climbed this thing, but when we got to the top, the wave was gone. We went into this 'building'. We sat in chairs and this guy whistled and a wave came over. My ears felt funny. We had to move as other people were getting seated. The chairs were really comfy. There was a whistle, and then an earthquake. Some people were testing out weapons which were causing the waves and earthquakes. We had to keep moving. Orlando Bloom was there?"
"0483"	"(2006-01-06 (14)) It was the day before school and we still hadn't gotten our uniforms. Someone said that I was suicidal."
"0484"	"(2006-01-07 (14)) I was watching a movie? There were big waves and I held onto this thing but the rest got knocked down. Haley Joel Osment was there and there was a goof, as he was there twice. He had a brother? There were animals that I 'made' a tiger etc. They were like fluffy toys. People were scared of them. They bit me, but then realized who I was and I was petting them."
"0485"	"(2006-01-14 (14)) I was at Mom's and Austin came over and he was drunk or something. He started going all crazy and we ran to this house across the road and he was following us. There was a Runescape like prison."
"0486"	"(2006-01-14 (14)) I was at Brookland High School, except it was different. Ramona enrolled there too, and there was a ghost. People ate cat litter. I was supposed to do some speech, but I got out of it and I was allowed to go to West Whitehall Primary School. There were people there from Year 7. As I walked back, 50 odd other people from my school were there too. It was windy. I was watching KPAX which was completely different. Kevin Spacey was saving these people, two kids and a woman from a fire. He was crying."
"0487"	"(2006-01-16 (14)) Ezra and I ended up at this house. We had $20 on us and a bag of stuff. This guy there went psycho and I had a low battery on my phone and no credit. We had this 4-wheeler that was really slow. The guy chased us and we gave him a heap of coins. All of a sudden we were at this place in the Gold Coast. I was in pajamas? Ezra, psycho dude and a few others were there too. This lady let me use the phone and I called Mom and I asked her what year it was, and she replied 2270. We somehow got back. Mom came with the police and they had my diary."
"0488"	"(2006-01-17 (14)) I had a friend called Callum. He died. I could still see him though, and I could also see some other people. Erik Stolhanske was at dinner. I was near/in the shed, someone touched me and I screamed. I got told off for screaming."
"0489"	"(2006-01-20 (14)) I was at a video shop and Kevin Spacey was there, and he was high and sitting on a shelf. I was going to ask if I was allowed to get his autograph but then this guy asked him so I did too. He wrote on a bit of paper ""nerd, nerd, nerd"" and wrote something about a moose. He tore the sides off. He was asked to get a new cover for The Evil Dead by 9am and I told him about some computer place where he could do it. We had to work there. We came back later and hid in the cupboards. I was driving Kevin's car to get to this friend of mine and I got lost."
"0490"	"(2006-01-20 (14)) I was in the car with Dad and he crashed into a house. It was night. They let us in and they had no water. I think we crashed again. Callum Blue was sitting next to me and was slowly getting closer and putting his arm around me."
"0491"	"(2006-01-23 (14)) I was friends with this guy and he had a little sister. There was a big spider thing. The parents were evil. I was in a gym. There were Virgin Mary statues that we had to use to get out."
