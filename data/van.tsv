"001"	"(05/29/07)"	"I was part of a team searching for terrorists who were plotting to destroy a Portuguese replica of a great city. The plot I helped foil previously involved the Brandenburg gate type columns being blown up and falling onto a nationalist shrine. This next clue was much harder. Something to do with the beach. There were hostages who knew, but couldn't or wouldn't talk. They were being systematically killed. We guessed the wrong one who would be killed, but I saw the gunman walk up, take aim and shoot a dart into the neck of one of them. He was a tall, bald Asian man in a suit. Young, with purple accents. I was wearing my pumas, so I didn't make much noise. I saw he was heading to a run-down house in the Arab sector. I ran up to him, watching my shadow as I sprinted. Then I put him in a headlock and attempted to drag him into traffic. He was strong, and when cars were about to hit him, he bended and leapt away. The people inside the house, a family of freedom fighters, ran out. They didn't want to blow their cover. The dad ran out to help the comrade and was killed. Splattered. I was dragged inside. They were old and young, men and women. A regular extended family -- people who did not look at all like terrorists. The police came and they convinced the overly soft officers that it was just a domestic disturbance and the officers left their house. They would do anything to get the attention away from them. Instead of exacting revenge, they scooped me in on their plan. I assume the result ended up in my above condition. I remember bits from the shootout, including one of their badly injured having a gun near their heart to be blasted because they were not well liked."
"002"	"(05/29/07)"	"I dreamed that I had just woken up in a hospital room. I remember snippets of the surgery. I had been badly hurt. A bullet, perhaps. It was in the same place where my appendix scar is. It didn't hurt yet, but I knew and wanted and was looking forward to painkillers. At my bedside was my mother. And in my bed was a girl who was beautiful, who said she loved me and that her name was Kimmi. A tooth of mine was loose also. I looked around. All kinds of stuff was strewn about the room. Spoils of some kind. The thing is, I didn't remember a single thing. I knew who my mother was, and later, who my friends and brother were when they came in, but the past -- I don't know how long -- was gone. I told Kimmi that I didn't know who she was and if I loved her. We snuggled close. I put my hand on her pajama-clad leg. I felt bad that I couldn't remember her. My mother accepted her, so I assumed they had met previously. Marvin, Kareem (friends from college), someone I didn't know and my brother Gerald came in. They were congratulatory. They were also giddy and laughed the laugh of someone who knows something that you should know but don't. Apparently, I did something completely badass and somehow got away with it. Kimmi was having a hard time coming to terms with my memory loss. My friends were making sexist remarks. I didn't know her, but I felt strongly for her and sorry for her. Her parents had warned her to stay away from people like me who would break her heart. She went to the bathroom to freshen up. She was strong, though. And pushed through the crap.  I also had a loose tooth. When it came out, it had a metal root, very futuristic. Like an implant.  I yelled because I wanted to share this with Kimmi. ""I feel like I am 10 or 12."" I tried to remember when my teeth last came out."
"003"	"(10/22/07)"	"I was back on the island. There were trip leaders (an outdoor group from college) there instead. They were taking us on a mystery trip, but it turned out that they didn't plan well. We were chilling in the Starbucks before we learned of how/when we would depart."
"004"	"(10/22/07)"	"Going through the Arab marketplace. The trowel debate. The sticky, $1500 worth of pot. I knocked some over. But rolled a blue putty joint and smoked it myself. I held it for a long time with my eyes closed."
"005"	"(10/22/07)"	"Plane came down in a very fast water landing. It was supposed to be a crash, but somehow, we managed and came down in just the right spot for transport to the airport"
"006"	"(10/22/07)"	"I was on a Halo map (a video game) against some other island people with alligator people on my team. Most didn't last very long. But Sue, a co-worker I was attracted to, took up a position on a cliff of the map, which consisted of a crashed covenant ship in the middle surrounded by tall cliffs with a long ledge and a valley. After some killing -- after I established by head-shot dominance by killing the people around her and communicating with her through the headset -- we went back to base and lay down. We were tired. Like a game of paintball, we took off our helmets and sat down. Drew (a co-worker on the college newspaper) was there. I proved I could snipe him if I wanted. We got into a fistfight. I punched him a couple times and he needed to go to the bathroom. My co-worker Sue came back. I sat down. Instead of sitting nearby, she lay across my lap. Mixed signals. She changed positions twice, each one more sexual -- straddling me front, then back. My pants were off, as I was cooling down. My underwear wouldn't stay up revealing glimpses. She didn't seem to mind."
"007"	"(10/22/07)"	"It was a big house that one sister had just bought. Not my sister, but a new family that had moved into a house where my family used to live. The visiting sister was pregnant. Very pregnant. She was helping the sister sand the floors in one bedroom. A lot of remodeling needed to be done. They were talking about how the place was had at a good price partially because someone died on the stairs years before. A roll of tape or something dropped and rolled out the door and went down the stairs and stopped halfway down. The pregnant sister went after it. For some reason, nails covered the stairs. Some were sticking up without explanation. The sister got a foreboding feeling and told her pregnant sister to hold onto the rail. The wood on the steps was scratched and had chunks missing from it. She reached for the door, but the seam was gone. It wouldn't open. But then she double took. The seam was back. She opened the door and let the light and outside air come in. She led her sister by the hand to the bottom and outside. She insisted the stay there for a while. The pregnant sister thought she was being silly. Then very sinister sounding rock music with a steady, deep drum and base picked up just inside normal hearing range. There were noises of sex and violence intertwined. She looked inside and felt death. The older sister ran with her younger sister to her old car parked out front, got in, and started driving. The younger sister was starting to get afraid after her initial reaction of skepticism. As they drove away and looked back, the house looked like it was burning, like a gothic building burning in a dim, ashy haze of fire and smoke."
"008"	"(10/22/07)"	"Dreamed that I was in pursuit of an injured bird-like alien. I had maimed it with the covenant carbine. It was like a little tweet bird. I imagined an owl taking me and it, a friend owl, off to a nest for interrogation. But the thing made me think, somehow, I could catch baby owls in my bowels. So it got away temporarily. It flew up slightly higher than a jump. I followed with a little more effort. It went down a tunnel into a larger room filled with broken munitions. I had the rifle and I was able to use several of it other settings. Just holding it, the trigger wasn't readily apparent. I kept making it to a soft targeting laser. I shot at it a few times and it died down on my radar. By the time I got in, it had been drug off by another combatant or skulked off somewhere to die. There were broken pieces of the laser and the sniper on the ground. I picked them up, but they wouldn't equip. Just like picking up an empty weapon. I tried putting them together, but they didn't magically ""click."" Next, I went outside and I was taken down into the belly of the pillar of autumn, which had been resurrected, but completely taken over by the flood. It was nasty. But when I awoke, I was at an outdoor camp with a lot of other guys, rednecks who were on my team, defending our base. This was Halo, the video game, but real. I had the sniper. It was dark, the enemy was far. I could barely see the flint of the enemy snipers' scope. It was closer to America's army. One guy was defending our base-proper down at the temple, where you had to ask quietly and then progressively get louder before toy made it inside to score. The enemy took our flag and made it most of the way back. One of our guys chased them and stopped the carrier right outside his base. I took out the two guys running for it with the sniper. The flag slid down the hill. Enemies were circling from behind to get it. I alerted my camp partially because I didn't want to deal with the mess. As a counter, the guy near their base took their flag, but dropped it just outside. One-handed, I grabbed a brute shot and took out a guy no-scope with the sniper. I grabbed the flag in the same hand as the brute shot and ran to the temple. I made it past spectators, across bridges and stairs, and spit my gum out at the doors."
"009"	"n/a"	"(10/22/07 [nap]) I'm chasing after an artifact in the islands. The small bead-string of land is somewhere remote in the Caribbean. They are pine islands, scrub forests and shanty settlements. Shallow sea and reef lay in between. Large companies have set up some mysterious operations on one of the larger islands, requiring copious amounts of power. The adventure begins when I hijack a twin-engine split-tail seaplane and fly into this island in pursuit of a bad guy. I'm with a close ally in the plane. Someone who I care about and trust. The bad guy has henchmen. They thwart our escape. We incapacitate or kill many of them, but they slow us down enough for the bad guy to escape in a small, single-engine plane. We've been in pursuit for months. I wasn't going to let him get away. In a mad, desperate, injured dash, I make it to my waiting plane. I can't really fly well. But I am co-pilot anyway. The bad guy has a smaller, more maneuverable plane. He takes off through the mess of power lines. At first I don't think it's an issue -- but we soon learn there's no way to blast skyward with the big plane's power with the lines overhead. Instead, we fly low under them and try to accelerate. The bad guy zips out and takes off toward another island."
"010"	"(10/28/07)"	"I was on an island. This place was fairly bare, but there was a local encampment funded by the island's far-off government on the mainland. That was the locus of control and commerce and entertainment for the whole island. Behind the field station, there was a bar that reminded me of a dockside bar I know. I went inside and was at first pitted against a redheaded crazy guy. The fight was completely voluntary, a weekend fight night or something similar. He looked crazy, and I underestimate my own abilities, so I was nervous going in. But when the fight started, I quickly capitalized. I kicked at him and he came in low, trying to grab my legs and take me down. What did I do? I got behind him and put him into a chokehold. There was some rule that forbade me from choking him at a specific angle, so when I was called out by the judge, I adjusted. It took a little longer, but he was on the verge of passing out after a few extra seconds. His face looked like it was going to pop. It turned red, then blue. Then he tapped out. I won. I was tired. I went and sat with my mother at a back table until the next match. We were all sort of refugees here. I was studying at a field station at the island. There are rebels in the nearby hills. They came down one day and decided to raid the station in two waves. The hills were green and rolling, but difficult to scale--and deeper in, there were ravines and forested ridges. The first was terror. I didn't know quite why. But they came in waving AK-47s and roughed us all up. It was almost as if it was a rogue band that went in ahead of the serious group to have a little fun. I ducked out of the back patio and behind one of the three-story house's pillars. They left, and I ran to notify the headmaster we were under attack. Just as I was getting her to understand -- she was saying we should just let them run their course -- there's not much we can do. Bull shit. The second wave came in. I went out to fight them. But the second wave was by far more serious. The point man had what I can only describe as a brute shot. It launched these explosive shells at low velocity. I dodged them. And when the dozen more marauders came over the hill, I evacuated. The second man in the bar I fought was a slightly pudgy, but muscular black guy. He was solid, and fast for his relative size. I told my mother he's stronger than me, but I was still faster. I went at it. My punches connected, and I swept him at the ankles. "
"011"	"(10/29/07)"	"It was again a dream on the Bahama island of Andros. This time, though, it was a quasi-race, like the gumball rally, only on foot. It began like a 5k run. I began at the head of the pack, and challenged myself to stay that way. I always start that way. I have no patience. But because of the technical nature of the course, my head kept in the game. It was over streams and things, then it took a right turn. We went up a tree and into an abandoned mining house, like the kind at Disney world. We went across a synthetic board linking the roof to a rail system that had palm frond particleboard instead of ties. They did things that way here. The linking bridge -- I was certain the course organizers put them there -- they looked too new and custom-made, like tar-paper-covered boards on a mountain bike trail. Eventually, things began to get mythical. We needed to get onto the roof of an old woman's house -she had the ancient aura of Amelia Marshal, but she baked goods instead of made baskets. There was one runner guy who had lead the pack. I was behind him for most of the way, but still up at the front. When we got to the dead-end house part -- we didn't want to disturb her from sleeping. We had to get permission to go through. So we had to wait until she woke up. But I got a better idea. There was a tree next to her house and one in the yard. They had long branches. I climbed and pulled down one branch. Another competitor jumped for it. Grabbed it, and made it to the roof. Another did the same for me, but it was really far -- and I was in a different place. It was a skinny branch, and there was a chance of it breaking. Instead, I went inside and asked her nicely. She baked me a pastry. I ate it, but then things changed."
"012"	"(10/29/07)"	"There was a robot guard lady. She was big, and made of iron. She was going after a sleeping friend in the blue-light-covered colder upstairs part of her house. It was difficult to defeat, because of its mass. I hit it, dented it, and smashed at it on every joint and from every angle. Eventually, it fell. I dodged its blows because it was slow. I hit it. But then it turned into a more feminine robot. It was still muscular, but somewhat attractive, with blonde hair and a pierced nose. It got even softer as I began to talk to it. It looked like the hot Krishna girl. It opened its legs and I began having sexual intercourse it. She said it was very enjoyable, because I was passionate, not self-centered."
"013"	"(10/29/07)"	"There was going to be an opening to the next stage. I went to the roof, but everything turned cold. The robot froze. My companions, they gave in to the cold. The snowstorm was so ferocious, I gave my blue jacket to a companion, but he froze. I took it from him and put it on. He was gone. I figured with my fleece and that jacket, I'd be fine. The old woman walked out, then froze. I felt bad, but she went without complaint. Then, I walked to a portal and faced the final boss in a Halo (video game) multiplayer map-like arena. It was gray and had cube-like spires. I beat it and got my ranking. But it was real life. I was near the top, but not the best. I was yellow, the best was orange on the scale. Very aggressive amateur. About 1192 out of 1800. I was angry that I should have gotten a higher score. Only one or two was better than mine."
"014"	"(11/13/07)"	"I was in my apartment. It was raining hard. People and strangers were all hanging around, waiting for some tremendous event, like a hurricane, to happen. We flitted around the restaurants nearby. I returned to wait. To play Halo, the video game, or rather, to consider playing it as I tried to get work done with the usual noise happening all around. I walked outside to the porch, reminded me of the porch in a house I once lived in, only it was the front parking lot of the apartment I lived in while a junior in college. I was just chilling--it was really late--so late, it was almost early. The college student newspaper I had worked for had gotten out. And then co-worker I was attracted to, Sue, appeared through the sliding glass door. She was wearing a blue nightgown, with a deep v between her breasts, which seemed much bigger than normal. She looked amazing. I told her that. She really was the most amazing thing I had ever seen, with her golden locks flowing down over her shoulders. She was trying to get reception on her Cingular phone. She had a booster. I told her there used to be a receiver or something on the roof."
"015"	"(12/14/07)"	"Checked into a by-the-hour motel with the Hoffman sisters, whom I know as friends. The guy at the counter was busy, so he really didn't care about keeping track of the time. ""Just get out by tomorrow,"" he said. I checked the place out, but Katrina Hoffman was tired and crashed on the sheets, which I warned were probably not clean. Rebecca Hoffman was being flirty, even though I was seeing her sister. A voice came on telling me my mud turtle buried itself in the mud under a rock and probably died. I was in denial, because the turtle burrowed under there itself and turtles can live in hibernation for months. When I lifted the rock in the muddy enclosure to find out, lots of other bright-eyed geckos and other animals came out, in addition to my gecko."
"016"	"(01/16/08)"	"It was in another country or world, where the rules were suspended and the technology was like old-mob Chicago meets swords and scythes. There was a large complex -- a restaurant lounge next to a hardware/junk parts depot. I was coming in from the outside, from a more prosperous place, after being away for a long time. My family, though, had stayed behind. Well, what was left of it anyway. The locals scoffed at me for being too soft, too high cultured. I thought they could be right. To me, they were dirty and stupid. But quite rough. The owner of the complex, guess who, a scheming Persian, had slighted my mother in some nefarious way. I sought revenge. At first, he tried to appease me, bribe me off. I started to walk away, but then rage came over me. With a well-connected friend at my side, I grabbed up a pole with a reaper-like scythe, but with a more hook-like blade, and charged into the outdoor bar, which was assembled with makeshift barrels and bare, gray-aged plywood. The building it was attached to was a former postal facility. It was huge, like the building of the newspaper where I interned. The man saw me, and then darted away into a mail shoot. He had a pistol with him. As I moved to follow him, I hesitated -- my large weapon would be unwieldy inside. My friend opened his jacket and revealed a 6-shot revolver. I took it from him, and attacked. I could see his head just peering over the top of the maze-like aluminum dividers. I fired for his head. The bullets were bunk. The shots came out slow. They didn't penetrate all the way through. I fired, each shot whizzing inches by his head, diverted by the metal. I fired a close one. It must have grazed him. He stumbled near an exit. I had a clean shot. Click. I was out. He raised his weapon and came after me. I ducked behind a corner and ran. My friend had a hard time getting more bullets out of his pocket. He handed me three. I put one, two in. and fumbled with the third. Screw it. I hope they go in the correct rotation order. He appears over the top of a metal wall. I shoot him in the chest as he raises his gun to fire. He falls back, but is still alive. I move to kill him. His daughter appears. She helped him in the plan against my family. She is pretty, but looks kind of gypsy-like. I knock her to the floor. My friend says, let's rape her. He grabs her by the arms and holds her. This actually excites me. Yes, I want revenge. Yes, I very well could be within my rights. I move to her, and pull up her thin, tattered dress. I think about it. She could have a disease. I touch her. She's wet, sticky. I decide no. I can't do this. I go to her father and put a bullet in his head. She pulls a rat-shot makeshift gun from her side and shoots him in the chest. It's almost as if she wanted it. She could have used it on us to get away. I guess she didn't like him."
"017"	"(01/19/08)"	"Jordan, an ex-boyfriend of my former girlfriend Annie, invited me over to his house. He was far more docile and timid than I remember. He wasn't angry. Just told me to watch out--to be sure I really knew her before I got any deeper. That she was the type to lead guys on, and mess with them. Then I went to go check her out. She was staying back in her place in the north. In my head, it was a nearby university town, but more rural. I went around campus, checking around. I'd rented a minivan -- to carry all my stuff. For some reason, I brought all my essentials. Then I got an e-mail -- I just read it. It felt like it was beamed into my head or onto a sheet of paper right in my hands that I was reading. She said she wanted my sperm. And that if she were a sperm, she would want to be inside my warm body and then have it swim into hers. She's crazy like that, I admitted. I couldn't get a hold of her all day, like in real life. So I went to go pack up my mini van. But apparently, the one I loaded up with my stuff was the wrong one. It had been sketchily commandeered by a Chinese businessman and his associate and his driver. The driver was going to the airport. It felt like another country. It was like $50 a mile for rental and gas. I felt sick thinking of the miles rolling past -- and that I had left the minivan, the one I rented, back at the college part of town. We stopped to get gas at a Sunoco or something or a Shell on a busy strip filled with fast-food strip malls near the airport. I called Annie. I finally got through. There was laughing in the background. Her tone was like, ""Hello? ohhh, Hi.... yeah, I'm having fun right now -- what do you want?"" I asked her to pick me up. She sounded hesitant, like she couldn't. Then, I woke up."
"018"	"n/a"	"(01/19/08 [nap]) I am a reporting intern at a newspaper. I am assigned a case involving a soft-core porn star in a photo shoot gone bad. I was supposed to meet with her at a pre-arranged time, along with another reporter, Kat. I was waiting for the call from the source when something came in over the police scanner -- a 911 call came in from Kat. She was reported missing. I got a text message from an unknown number stating that she was in trouble, and that I was supposed to arrive at the location, a parking garage, ASAP. For plot purposes, I'll add that the source witnessed an uneasy actress get drugged to ""calm her nerves."" But somehow, through OD or allergic reaction, she died. The drugs were administered to her after she had already been plied with alcohol. And she took convincing to take it. The witness played dumb. Still, they threatened her. I rush to the parking garage. Another reporter had already been dispatched -- most of the editors hadn't known we would be there for the story, and the cops' reporter just heard of the situation from the police radio. The report stated that Kat had been struck over the head when she neared the pre-arranged meeting place. She found herself slumped in the bed of a truck a few moments later. She woke up -- they hadn't knocked her out for too long. She got up, and began to run in a staggered way away, down the ramp. She got down a level, and the people had noticed her escape. They chased after her. The brown ford pickup was right in front of her. Her back was to the railing. One of the guys ran at her, but tripped over a parking block. Kat started screaming.  The other, who got spooked, opened the door. A Starbucks cup with my first name on it fell out. The guy got up and ran back to the truck. A pedestrian started to approach. The truck peeled out. It appears that I looked too eager to write the story. The editors criticized me for thinking it was in my station to cover something this big. And because of the cup, I was accused of even being complicit in the plans. Also, there was a report that came in that said four reporters had gone missing, but it was later amended."
"019"	"(01/20/08)"	"""Let's go. Hands behind your back. Let's go."" The officer's voice was so calm, so soft and casual. The words entered my dream. (I woke up and found a man was actually being arrested outside my window.) "
"020"	"(01/26/08)"	"I was with a fly-ins (journalism project) group on a Hawaiian island. We were studying something, but then our time was up -- and a terrifying natural phenomenon was occurring -- towering waves, taller than the mountains, were rising up out of the sea and slamming into the barrier islands. The spray washed for miles, and the huge, luxurious resort hotels were being rained on by the deluge, despite their distance. The water poured down the rocky ledges below the resorts. Many had watersides into the deep turquoise channel, which looked warm and welcoming, despite the darkness on the horizon, the area shaded by the rain and waves. The hotels were used to this, it appeared, because they had water channels. If I were a guest, I would be terrified. But the buildings looked to be built like bank vaults. Just before the hotel, I was running through an ancient aqueduct system, that was blue and sea green tile all over. The walls of water were rushing from every direction. Me and my accomplice ducked behind a pilaster to avoid the wall. When it passed, we ran some more, but couldn't run our fastest -- the floors were slippery. I pushed off columns with my hand for that much extra momentum. We made a right turn and entered the hotel level."
"021"	"(01/26/08)"	"I was going through level after level of ancient ruin. These weren't the deepest, darkest mazes, but more like gutted old stone houses, with doors and dungeons that lead to other realms. On one of the final levels, a vampiress came out of one door and was trying to escape into another. She was a spy. Hit her with my sticks. I had two sticks, strong, fighting sticks. She dropped a potion. When activated, poured out, I guess (didn't want to think what would happen if drank -- would the portal open inside you?) a portal opened. Me and my party went inside. Inside, my team was instantly assailed by a group of sadistic killers. One was holding hostage a daughter of one of the people. Only he had the key. We chased him around the top level of a penthouse suite. He was fond of knives. He was approaching one in a room alone, then I came in, grabbed him, and hurled him against a mirror, grabbing the back of his head and then slamming it into the glass, breaking it, then dragging his face down the splintered slivers, hoping the edges would grab on his skin. I then threw him down when he didn't reveal the location of the key. I held him on his stomach, then took out a couple pieces of glass from the mirror. I threatened to cut him more. He was silent. A fellow emptied his pockets and there were two sharp pocketknives. I got up to reach for one, but then the guy made his escape. I looked back, he was gone. He'd gone outside -- there were similar battles going on in every room and hallway - it was chaos. He shut the door... and the peephole had been reversed. I looked under. I could see his feet. I grabbed a knife, an old, but still shining and sharp cross-handled dagger, and slammed it through the door, hopefully to hit his body pressed up against it. His knife, the same model as mine, came through at the same time and jabbed me in the hand. I wanted to slam through the peephole and get him in the eye. The door was a tan color. There was carpet in the room. Then, the door flung open. He had taken one of our older guys, like Captain Picard, hostage. The knife was to his neck. I wanted to throw my knife, but I didn't think it would take him down before he could cut our friend. Then, an old assassin on our side came up behind him and cut his throat with a razor. He fell to the floor, releasing our guy. Then when we were happy, the guy got up. Or started to. The assassin hit him again in the chest. I threw my knife. It hit his chest with the hilt, but then bounced and jabbed his face. He didn't move. He was dead. Also, back at the hotel, after the fight, I had a lot of glass shards embedded in my bare feet. I kept having to pull them out, like three or four long shards. I remember hit hurting, but it hurt the people looking on more to see these long pieces coming out all bloody."
"022"	"(01/26/08)"	"Exploration of a ruin. Ancient evil stuff there. Another strong, beautiful female went into the submerged place... and then a curse came upon her. The air in her tank disappeared and she had to live for a day on the scant air in the dungeon, which had filled up with even more water. In the dungeon with no air, I went in to help. There were doors, inside were creatures -- venomous, toothy, dog-like beasts that were like hairless, slimy pit-bulls, but evil. I had a sort of map in my head of my abilities. Acid spray, fire bolt, disable, life drain -- that sort of thing. I selected some, and then blasted one of the creatures when it came out at me. It didn't do much. It was more powerful than my abilities. I beat it to death with my hands. The girl survived. She remained calm. Opened a passage, and used the air up in each one, slowly."
"023"	"(01/26/08)"	"A co-worker I was attracted to, Sue, was chiding me about not following up to a porn story. I'd been researching it for a long time. I'd gotten in on the industry. The industry where we were was built on a shady dungeon... filled with water. She was working for the newspaper where I interned one summer while in college. She was writing a story in a cubicle across from me. I looked over and IM'd her. She laughed because I was right there. I looked into her eyes. I laughed. God, I wanted her."
"024"	"(02/02/08)"	"I dreamed that I was working in the newsroom of the newspaper where I interned, after writing stories all day, and then Miriam and Heidi (editors) came up to me and said I was fired. Heidi, in her timid yet last-word way, told me they had to let me go. They didn't give any real reason, just that I wasn't doing my job up to standards and they had decided to fire me. I didn't see it coming. They handed me a check for $1000 and said I had to go. I was distraught. I didn't know why. I asked, why? Are you serious? Come on, I've done a great job every day, what reason do you have? Their response was still, we're sorry. We like you, but we need to let you go. I was afraid. Thoughts of the future ran through my head. What was I going to do? Where was I going to go? How will this affect my future at the newspaper that had just hired me? I was on the verge of tears. I was begging to let me stay, or at least give me an explanation. They wouldn't. I especially thought I could affect Heidi with my pleas. Didn't work. I left, and went home. I got in my car and just drove. When I arrived, I walked in all disappointed. I told my mother what happened. She tried to comfort me, but her words felt patronizing. They gave me an ""I told you so"" that it wasn't a real internship, that they were leading me on. I got mad at them. I showed them my paycheck. My father was there, and he said it was a fake thing and I should tear it up. I insisted that it wasn't - because it was real. I went downstairs to my room in the house we lived in when I was a young teenager. The walls were blue, and the desk was against the wall facing the Taylors' house. The desk was dark wooden particleboard. It was scratched, and smelled like spilt cereal and had snot on it. I sat down my new laptop on the old keyboard tray and began to play a sim-copter like game. My newspaper job, apparently, was parallel to flight school. My first helicopter was a small 2-seater. I took off and made a perfect landing. Shows them. Then, I got upgraded. It was fast, a heavy lifter. 4.5 stars. And priced reasonably as well. There were other options, like the fat, heavy birtha copter. It only got two stars. Why would anyone get that? Well, for heavy lifting, probably. I was on a mission against zombies. I wasn't sure exactly what I had to do, but knew it would become clear when I reached the combat zone. I arrived, and flew into a building, lightly bumping or just barely missing the ceiling. I flew inside, into the conference hall, realized nothing was there but Z and then flew out. I saw a green beacon. It was a person, being surrounded by zombies, up on a mesa-like patio. I flew in low and tried to hit the zombies. I missed. I swung around and took them out with the second pass. They started following me after the first pass. The glowing green female townsperson, I flew over her and she was rescued. There were two more. I rescued one not far, but time was running out to get the third. 3...2....1...0.021.... I hit pause, as I knew I wouldn't have enough time. I went upstairs to the kitchen and had dinner, mini-cupcakes and beef jerky. My sister gave me hers. I went down stairs and saw that I got a greeting card from Heidi. I ran upstairs to show my mother they actually cared and felt bad. Then when I went back down to open it, it was official-type documentation. It was a form offering me to attend seminars during the summer, and permission to use some of my articles in a contest. I thought about declining, but that'd probably hurt me in the long run. They have no gratitude. And it's one of those things where I don't know why I got fired, so when someone asks, it looks like I'm hiding something."
"025"	"(02/24/08)"	"I was working at the newspaper where I interned. I had gotten there early. But I was tired, and a little hungry. Everyone was there, the vets and all of the young people. Luckily someone brought cupcakes. Both white and chocolate frosting. I ate one vanilla. Then I went for another. Then I realized I was tired. The day was going by slowly. I put my head down on my desk and fell asleep. I thought I had only been passed out for a minute or so, but when I awoke, it was apparent I had been out for some time -- you know, that unknowing guy drooling and snoring in an inappropriate place, while everyone steps over him to do real work. I finally woke up and realized the time. I felt compelled to go out and do something. So, rain coming down, my car still musty from the sunroof incident, I started driving. I drove north, toward the bad part of town, but not quite there. I stopped at my bank to look for a story. Instead, I ended up driving around and then I realized something and needed to go back. The parking lot was a maze. I went around three or four times, cutting through the drive-thru banking center until I finally decided to turn into the bank's outdoor stairway leading inside. My car cleared the teller counters, hit the tile main floor and then I proceeded out the open front doors and down the main steps. I got out of my car, which may have been stuck, and picked up a modern, skinny skateboard. I saw another skateboard on the ground, it looked nice -- I could use it as a backup. But it was missing the front trucks and wheels. I began to try to skateboard. I felt unbalanced, but I got up and was able to cut and turn like I knew what I was doing. Two young skateboard guys were in front of me. They stopped and I fell as I ran into them. They said sorry indirectly. They looked at my board and said they once saw one you could kick and it would come up. I said yeah, a NASH skateboard. Everyone had one back in my day. We continued down the concrete path. They kept getting in my way. One pushed me, and I took a left path toward what doubled as the Reitz/building of the newspaper where I interned. I made the turn down a side path but then veered into the grass. I got up and went into the building. I went into the bathroom, and for some reason I put on a shirt and a thick coat and left my pants behind. I took the elevator up to the newsroom. Then I realized I had no pants on. It was night, so the office was dark. I dashed back into the elevator level. I hoped nobody saw me. I took the elevator back down to the safety of the bathroom. Once inside, I stepped into a stall and started to pee. It was the sort of after-sex pee. The stall door was broken. I was still wearing the heavy ski coat. Then the security guard came in. I ignored him and continued to pee. Then he came in and started watching me, under the guise of fixing the door and keeping watch. I said '""alright, nothing to see here. Everything's fine."" He said ok, ok but didn't move. ""I got angry and said, leave me the fuck alone, let me pee in peace, goddamn it."" He finally moved. I finished and went to the sink. He followed me. I told him to leave me alone. But because he saw I had no pants on and he was a pervert, he stepped close to me and gave me an ultimatum. I nodded, ok, but instead, punched him and grabbed away the gun he was waving around. I also, somehow, had a makeshift grenade. I backed away and pointed the gun at him. It was a big gun -- it was big in my hand, black, with more stylized points than most. Like a slightly smaller desert eagle. I held the gun in my right and the grenade in my left. It was tough holding the grenade so tightly with one hand, so I changed hands. I told him he should have made his move then, and that he's too cowardly to even try anything. He stepped closer and said I wouldn't have shot. He sat down on a stool near the mirrors and laughed at me, said I wouldn't shoot if he made a move. He made a taunting false-move, and I pulled the trigger. The shot hit him in the face, right underneath his right eye. The hole was massive. It could have been a kill shot, but then again, people do survive shots to the face. I look at the gun. It has a clear clip that was so long it stuck out. I had a lot of shots left. I thought, man, I should have shot him in the kneecap or something. But he wasn't dead. He was talking. But burbling, and his right eye was turning bloody and yellow. Then, I decided to kill him. I fired all over his head and face, carefully, but he wasn't dying. Somehow things fast-forwarded to a future documentary. He was old and disfigured, like someone and sewn his face back together with rough stitches and frozen icicles. He was a mad scientist or something, with a secret mechanical lab. Next, I go back to the newsroom. Things get strange. I end up being a killer, contemplating killing a girl every night. I have the gun. And I go out and stalk a girl. I enjoy that more. So I don't do anything. One person is with me. Another wants to be killed. I throw rocks at her till one hits her and she goes down. Another just lays down and decomposes. I throw a rock at her, and hit makes an indent on her ghoulish body, her face is like a snakefish's head. Pointy teeth, round head. The rock unhinges her jaw and it flips up. I put my sandaled foot on it to put it back down. I think this is disgusting, as I got her decomposing flesh on my shoe. Cleaning solvents to fix it."
"026"	"(02/24/08)"	"I argue with a man at a zoo manatee exhibit. He is telling his wife and infant daughter they are carnivorous. I tell him they're not. They eat plants. He tells me, no, they eat meat. I say to him, look, they're eating water lettuce right now. They're larger than the usual kind of manatee. So I could be wrong. But that would be impossible. Look at them, slowly swimming around. He says they could eat fish. And I said to look at how slow they swim. They're like cows. They could be like whales and eat small stuff, but I know that's not true. I walk over to a tour guide and ask what they eat, are they carnivore or herbivorous? She says something about imported pigs, but then I clarify, ""me and this guy are having an argument--do they eat meat or plants. The attractive black woman says ""oh, plants,"" and I prove the guy wrong. She then says, ""It's not like sand people trivia or anything."" The 'comments' on the placard near the manatees has people talking about Star Wars. I flirt with her: ""do they travel in twos or single file?"" ""Are they easily scared, or brave?"" I think of more when I walk away."
"027"	"(03/12/08)"	"I was covering an event at a zoo in a small village-like location. I was talking to someone who was eager to talk to me about how much he liked the zoo. I was off talking to someone, then I saw the guy I was talking to earlier being hosed down or something by the park manager. He was on all fours, getting decontaminated.  He climbed the fence. I went over and the director didn't want to talk to me. I went over to the embarrassed guest and just started asking questions in a joking way. He responded, then, BOOM. Two p-51s collide in midair, sending wreckage flying across the area, setting fire to buildings. I said to him -- god, news -- I'll be right back. I ran out into the middle of the town square. I had my phone in my hand -- I was dialing the newspaper where I interned. Then a huge chunk of wreckage came down on the tower and a chunk flew off and fell on top of me. I thought ""this is it -- it's finally caught up to me"" but I was able to run free, although the falling chunk of airplane parts damaged my hearing a little. I ran off -- and saw the guy who climbed the fence taking pictures. I said -- can we use those later -- you will be in the newspaper where I interned. He said yeah and continued on. Nesmith came up and asked if I was ok. I said yeah, and she sniffed inside my ear -- she was a former military operative or something -- and could tell some ashes had hurt me. Next I come back and the place is being looted by vandals on brute choppers. I start shooting at them. I take one and swing it around by a chain like Mario. Then a helicopter comes in with their leaders. I attached the centripetally-risen bike to the helicopter and they fly off. The radio station. Magic sees this and announces, ""whoever did that gets a magic wand"" I consider calling in. but I go in and it's a party in someone's house. I shower in the bathroom with sightlines and the 1-way mirror in front. I wonder if anyone can see."
"028"	"(03/24/08)"	"It was a holiday, and to celebrate I entered a freestyle fighting competition down at the local park -- it reminded me of the soccer fields in a park I know. I'd made it through several rounds, and I was in the final bout. It was against a big, fat guy. He wasn't much taller than me, but could have weighed nearly twice as much. He had on a white shirt. I was wearing a pair of black cotton martial arts pants and a plain shirt. We traded blows and grapples. I felt strong, confident. He couldn't get me down. And despite the many blows I landed, they didn't seem to defeat his resolve at all. The judges called a break. A third fighter was introduced -- a wildcard. His job was just to intervene and mix things up. The fat guy backed away. I decided I had enough energy left just to deal with him quickly. I knocked him to the ground with a sweep and then felt I had the strength -- he was lighter than me -- to grab him by the legs and swing him out of the ring. It would have been faster than wearing him down with blows for a k.o. I succeeded. He got out of the ring and didn't return within the required three seconds. I then turned to the fat guy, but the judges called another break. This time for water. I talked to him and a fan base had gathered around me and my competition. Sides had been taken. I said, no matter who does win, it's good to know I made it this far -- into the final round. But money began to trade hands -- and someone stuffed a wad of 100s into my black belt. I took it all out and put it in my pockets. This was bet money. Thousands more was being traded under a tent with a limo under it. This is where the civility began to unravel. At the start of the next round, the competition bolted from the ring. He ran to the limo. I waited for three seconds to pass, so I would at least win on a technicality. Then I began pursuit. I ran, put the guy had jumped in. He was fleeing with all the bet money. I didn't care -- I didn't even think there was a prize. But I wanted closure. I wanted the satisfaction of knowing that I beat him. The limo tore of -- and mob-types in the crowd -- and some apparently paid-off policemen -- began shooting. The glass shattered around me. I ran back to the judges' tent and began talking to one of the refs or a journalist or someone. ""I know I won, but I'd rather win the right way, not on a technical knock out. If he came back, I'd give him the chance to prove himself, if he agreed that I had won the competition by the rules. But then the cops started to break everything up. My trainer and a friend began to run -- when they were cut out of their money, they got pissy. My contingent ran to the police chief's command van. As the officers/thugs began to literally extort and steal people's money as ""evidence,"" I told him he couldn't do this, and people in these parts had guns. But he said, ""maybe, but we have these--"" he raised a new, high-tech smg rifle. And I said, ""yeah? So what?"" and punched him in the face. He went down, but went for his radio, which had dropped. I picked it up and moved it away. I also took the smg, his automatic pistol handgun and an old-fashioned wood-stock soviet-looking sniper rifle, minus a scope, from the ground near him. I knew we had to move -- fast. My trainer had his own smg. My friend, I gave him the rifle and said to guard the police chief -- we could have held it, but we also needed to go and clear out the crooks. I wanted to leave him the automatic pistol, which looked strange, with a short barrel and clip storage on top, with some kind of extra grip brace. I wanted the range. But I thought I may need the pistol later. Plus, he'd be able to pick off anyone who approached the van (it was in the middle of the field) first with the rifle. We headed off. Also, I checked the guns for shoulder straps -- the smg and the rifle had them, so that couldn't factor into the decision. We rounded a corner in a residential neighborhood. An old, sagging wooden house stood there, and two thugs were in the alleyway, crouched down, guarding the entrance in the middle of the street. I hefted the smg, and depressed the trigger slightly. A green beam lanced out. I traced it on the thug's body. A red beam followed mine and trained on the second guy. My trainer knew what he was doing. As I saw them begin to notice the beams, I opened fire. The gun was on automatic. The bullets lanced out over the 30 yards and peppered his body. He went limp. My trainer fired fewer shots. I was worried his target might not be completely dead. But then I looked at the bodies in the dim alleyway light. We'd killed them so fast; they were slumped over where they stood. Then we got closer -- a dog had been crouched next to the guy my trainer killed. It was unharmed. It bolted. I raised my rifle and fired without aiming at it as it headed for a corner. The bullets flied all around it. I don't know why I was shooting -- it's not like the dog could warn anyone. But if it arrived bloodied and alone, the others would know something's wrong. I could feel its pace. and in its final bound before it rounded the corner, I hit it twice on its flank. It made it around the corner, but I doubted it would get much further. Then we entered the house. I had a glove on my left hand, but not my trigger hand. The trigger had grown hot. A downside to this high-tech weapon. I took the pistol out of my pocket. I knew the litting thing would spit fire like a dragon in these close quarters. It's snub-nose would make it even more versatile inside than the smg. Plus, I only had one clip inside each weapon -- the smg could run out at any moment. I decided to switch the fire mode -- it had four -- auto, four burst, three burst and a couple other modes. The pistol had auto, semi and safe. Inside was a disaster. Water was leaking, I don't remember any smells, but I remember thinking I'm glad I can't smell, it would be awful. The shower was dripping, and it looked like a person had been cut up into tiny chunks and was rotting inside. We cleared the house -- it was empty. Then I saw a bank tube, the kind used for drive through banks. Inside was a wad of cash wrapped in plastic. I took it out, showed my trainer, and stuffed it into the pocket I still had some of the fighting cash. I decided to exit via the window, jumping and using vines ripping from the wall to slow my descent. As I waited for my trainer to arrive, I listened to a downstairs apartment basement window -- I heard voices from a radio coming through there. I listened close -- and wanted to fire a few shots in -- no way to tell if someone was waiting inside with a shotgun. Then, an Asian man rode up on a bicycle, threw a brown paper bag, and then fled. The bag caught fire -- the blaze was large. I ran toward the edge of the flames to get past them before they got any larger. BOOM. The world became slow motion. The explosion shockwave flashed white. I jumped. And continued on the edge. I pulled the pistol and began firing at the guy. He was wearing a white shirt. I was waiting to see red spots. I kept missing, even though the little handgun sounded like a roar as it spat bullet after bullet. I expected my trainer to be following me. The bike guy rounded a corner outside a park -- and there was an entire Asian gang there. the connections were getting deeper -- cops, gamblers, organized crime. They didn't seem armed... except for a big guy in the middle. No quantity of guns, but quality, my god -- he had what looked like a SAW. But in the commotion, two of his own people ran in front of him as he opened fire at me. He was wearing a black, mandarin-collar suit. I opened fire when his two people went down. And my shots either hit or came close enough to cause him to fall back. I decided I was outnumbered -- and out of ammo -- and fled around the corner. This was not this world. There were a bunch of guys standing on the porch of this general store looking place. Inside, it was a gun shop. Even though both guns were 9mm, I asked for 5.56 ammo. The guy said he was out. All he had was 6.8 mm specialty ammo. Damn. He offered me the m4-like gun in the case -- I had enough cash to make a deal, but it would be tough to find that ammo elsewhere given the running state I'm in. I wanted to ask for a referral to a different place or to just buy a gun with compatible ammo. I got a 9mm pistol and went outside -- and the running began anew. It took me down stairs, and through an underground tunnel that took me to the edge of the city, where the world ended. It was a large lake that went off to infinity -- or rather -- a newly discovered realm that this place leads to. I went in with a group of trip-like people who I knew. It was a plateau surrounding a white sand, blue-water basin -- with a resort in the middle. There were dinosaur-like creatures, extinct mammals and even a unicorn. I waded across and was hungry. There was a girl who was naked. She talked to me. She was like an island native with a successful business. And inside, she ran a hot dog stand."
"029"	"(04/07/08)"	"Began with me and my brother Gerald slashing through new-era lugians (creatures in a video game called Asheron's Call we both played when we were younger) in a cave to get me a hollow axe (a weapon in that online multiplayer game). My current axe could swipe through each one in a single fall. After the hordes became too thick, we jumped out a tube with a yellow lift but many were inside. We met them outside and cut them down. They were beginning to turn into zombies. Legions of them. A bunch of young kids and rednecks began to arrive and slide down the tube that leads into the dungeon. I lead the way, others followed. A good group compiled. Including my little dog (a childhood pet) and someone to take care of her. The zombies were many. But I'd acquired a shotgun since. I was blowing them away. We were being pursued by the legion of doom, or whatever the big evil power was. The size and scope of their army was tremendous -- but they had not yet arrived here in full. We were just battling the natural wild beasts. It was a big stone building like the main city with the indoril guards in Morrowind. And it had canals. Many canals. (The dungeon had led us to an underground/outdoor type setting. I was supposed to meet my former girlfriend Annie , but she was at the end of our journey -- at the shore. In a fortress by the shore. I was to keep her safe. There was a preppy swimmer in need of help, so I used my powers to let him qualify for a race and claim his royalty position in the countryside so Annie could marry him and go off to be safe there. They here married before I was to see her again. I saw her see me. And then they were gone. I was left in a pet store like place on an upper floor of the large building. I held a little dog and was happy that she was finally clean and happy. Then I knew we must continue. I went outside, and the zombies were thicker than ever. There were stacks of industrial cargo -- we'd reached the shore area (this was the bay side). To avoid the zombies, we jumped (well, I jumped--the others had to knock stuff over to form bridges to get across... and ruined my stable jump/landing spots). A bag of special salt ripped and spilled down. And one zombie spoke to me. The salt cured or slowed the zombification process. ""Kill me -- and it will be honorable"" or something like that. I left him. And then the other bitten, but not-transformed zombie people gathered around. I threatened to shoot one of them if they tried anything funny. I stuffed salt into the barrel of the shotgun -- hopefully it would be more effective against the next zombie... and then. The sky turned red and any light turned red. a dust storm came from nowhere... and the legion of doom descended. The feeling was as if death had come to snatch the life out of everything everywhere, only it was worth -- that death would come only after all hope had been smashed out of you via torturous means. Thousands of lich warriors, brainwashed human minions serving a dark power. This was worse than Nazi Germany -- it was like the force from the chronicles of riddik. Only with undead and a giant seaborne army, with a giant command ship. I went into the town. I killed a few guards to get in unnoticed and quickly went inside an abandoned building with a few close warriors. ""Should we wait until morning for the suicide mission to destroy their main ship?"" Maybe. I had a hunch. I went inside the building and in a room met a member of the resistance who was hiding out. I felt confident with my weapon as I raided the place. He said there were more like him... and he would join us in our raid. I got a good feeling from him. Then, when we were supposed to be low and quiet, the younger brother of one of our companions started shining his flashlight through a darkened window at people dining on the sidewalk outside. He wanted them to think it was a ghost. One couple did and were shocked. Another old woman pulled a gun out of her purse... aimed... and I punched him in the face and took him down. The bullet missed him, but splintered off and hit McCoy (from Star Trek) in the leg. I told everyone to hide. The guards were on their way. I left the idiot who brought the roof down and ran. I ran into a building that looked like an outfitter store that was being forced to close. My character turned into a petite young girl. I saw someone who looked friendly on the steps... then I revealed myself -- these people looked good. They gave me some food... but then they wanted me to put on this control necklace/tag ""for legal use only"" it had on it. It was bright orange. The woman said, ""this will hurt less if you do it now."" she came toward me . I yelled, ""I would rather die free than live in captivity!"" I ran. I spat the food back as I made it to the window. I had River-like (from Firefly, a TV show) powers. I jumped backward and did a flip to the ground. Just then, the building next door -- the blue-suited rebel headquarters -- was being attacked. Green sidewinder-like missiles were launched inside. They launched a huge missile back the other way. it grabbed the two missiles and exited the other side right in the mass of oncoming enemy troops. but it didn't explode. it would have wiped them all out if it did. Then the psychic power enemy hero guy came in and tore out the minds of dozens of engineer-types as the poured out the front. the battle was over shortly. There were so many armed rebels... they were prepared... but when shit started flying, they went every which way. i watched as they were rounded up and stuffed into slave vans. I disabled a section of the fence to the camp from the outside -- so I could escape if I were put inside. I tied down the razor wire so I could exit over the pole. Then as I war pursued by the bad women who vowed to hunt me down, I went to a backwater Bahamas-type place with old septic trucks and porta-potties. I thought about hiding, but realized running -- getting distance on this place -- would be better. I lost my clothes, save for a shirt, in the escape. There were black guys on motorcycles and mopeds. I offered to buy one. They were trying not to make girl prostitute jokes. I knew I could probably beat them all up and steal their bikes, but I decided against it. I asked to test drive a moped (I couldn't reach the chopper pedals), plus it'd be easier to drive. He agreed... and then I took off, pedaling with the auxiliary. It was slower than I thought. They all came running after. they were running at super speed. I could barely get away. they grabbed my arms, but I peddled faster. I saw a big house at the end of the street -- I hoped I would find refuge there. But it was so far away... I awoke as the chase continued, and I was forced to do a circle maneuver."
"030"	"(04/09/08)"	"I traveled through a dimensional rift to a place and time where me, my friends and family (parents, brothers, some college friends) launched a successful pub/ice cream shop in the heart of a college-campus/trendy city place. Like a ""lifestyle center"". Business was booming and I was looking for a way to expand even more, without compromising our ""core values"" of ice cream and service."
"031"	"(04/09/08)"	"I was in competition with another newspaper for a story. A big story broke, and I was sent to cover it. I was worried about when I should leave for it. It ended up getting dark and I just sort of hung around the parking lot of the newspaper where I interned. I was thirsty, and I went to find water or something. I went home and took a shower. It was one of the houses I lived in when growing up. There was a photojournalist from the newspaper where I work doing a story of Obama or someone like that living in the house. I stepped out of the shower and the photographer was sitting right there on the couch, with a clear view of the hallway. He took a shot of the candidate with me in the frame in a white towel. As I moved to quickly get into my room, I slipped. He took another shot. I grumbled about how they offer no privacy. The journalist, a young girl eager to get a good story, came in to talk to me. I offered some good quotes (I can't remember them) as I was trying to fall asleep. She put them in the story, along with pictures. One of the pictures she got was one of me with a skinny black girl, the daughter of someone famous. One was me with my arms wrapped around her. The other was of my chest on her breasts. I had a distressed expression, like I was confiding something to her. The reporter had painted versions of me from the shots. They made it into a ""This American life"" photo story that was up for sale. It contained shots of everyone with me in the family business."
"032"	"(04/09/08)"	"After a long day on the job I went to my small apartment to rest. It was set up like the apartment from the dream where the employees of the newspaper where I interned came to my place. Except this was darker, with no windows. It was built in to the side of a grassy, shaded hill in a residential-type neighborhood near the lifestyle center. Either a puppy or stepbrother was there -- I was worried that I'd need to take care of him. Then Sue, the co-worker at my college student newspaper I was attracted to, came in. I didn't know it was she. She was working on some sort of protest or big assignment -- to get these files that will prove a group of people or animals or something like that was being subjugated to a cruel rule or being bullied or their rights were being infringed on. She said, ""I've been crying in there for 10 minutes,"" is how she came out. My hopes flew. Did she break up with him? I asked, ""Oh, no-- how come?"" ""It's just wrong what they're doing to them -- I have to do something to stop it."" I was disappointed, but jumped at the chance to help her with something. ""No matter what, I'll help you get this done."" She began the quest. She was the leader -- and a lot of liberal volunteers stepped in to help her. They began by running through the base -- there would only be one chance to stop it. There was a great robotic AI cyborg in there. Me, I moved along with the group -- unsure what the plan was -- but I was going to support them the whole way. I had more attack power and defense than any of them. I got too ahead and lost my way and fell down somewhere and had to re-spawn -- to join the group it required one of two crappy pistol-type weapons. I had them, but wondered why you needed loot to join. I thought, as I killed a creature, ""is there xp sharing?"" I thought, ""no,"" the level range is too great. I found several of them, including the second in command in an elevator/puzzle room. There were tiles that supposedly had to be stepped on in a certain order. One of the people had been working and memorizing for hours. I stepped on the tiles and barely made it up to the centerpiece as the girl had her hand on my head. She was supposed to be helping, but she was preventing me from jumping. I knocked her hand off and jumped and stretched and made it up. She was nice enough... As it turned out, just as I thought, it was not an elaborate puzzle at all -- it was a lift system power coupling. I pulled the switch and the thing exploded. I jumped out of the way and everyone was ok. We then approached the main gate, where I knew the showdown would take place... we were about to get inside when I woke up."
"033"	"(04/26/08)"	"Sue, the co-worker from my college newspaper I was attracted to, lived with her parents in the town where we went to college even though she's really from another town. I went over there after class to then go out to lunch with her. We were about to leave, then her boyfriend came over. She made fun of him for being shorter than me. Put her arms around him, then put her arms around my neck to see which embrace felt more natural. She was having trouble in economics, with a new professor. I wondered to myself why she was doing this."
"034"	"(05/08/08)"	"On a big playing field in my home state (though it looked like a professional baseball stadium), completing on-field obstacles with two other martial artist guys. I was bigger, faster and stronger, but they were more skilled at flips, tricks and techniques. We were completing tasks... The field turned into a house on campus. Morning was creeping upon us. Girls were there watching. I swung from a bar on the ceiling to kick in a curtain/screen. It was quite a distance, but I managed to cover it and kick the target. But my damage was minimal. I was going to run to get something to improve my flight... then, though, morning came. People were running to run. I was running to get somewhere. It felt so good just to run and not get tired. Like driving really fast on an open road, only with the satisfaction of knowing its all you. There was a field to my left, with a construction curtain thing on stakes. It was filled with huge, colorful toads. Then I went on to school."
"035"	"(05/08/08)"	"I'm going back to college for a semester. It all seems so small, like I've risen above it. It is actually high school. I feel like a college student in high school. I don't want to meet with my friend Andrew because he is so depressed. His ego is so fragile it seems like the slightest thing will send him into a cycle of depression. The layout of the school is like my old high school and the nearby art center. I am near the town's lunch area. Andrew goes in to get some food. I start walking toward the arts center lunch area. Before this, I run into some old friends, the Kelly Gill crowd. I move around the corner, but it's empty. In my time away they've combined the lunches. But someone calls to me on the way. Off to the side, where I sat with lunch with my high school sweetheart Cindy that one day, as people saw us together as they walked on to lunch. They were in the grass. Like one girl I knew in high school and that sort of people. They mixed with my college friends. They all wanted to get up and go. We went somewhere. Before that, I showed them pictures of my painting on the wall. Peeling a fruit like it had layers, like it was a part of the wall. The fruit, which Andrew bought, looked like a large gourd. It turned into a tent. Most were very impressed with my work. But Andrew had painted a less-good slogan over my good friend Doug's famous words in darker colors. The fruit peeling, I found the layer that had been painted and then grown over. People wanted to go someplace... so we left."
"036"	"(05/08/08)"	"We were driving, but then we had to stop. Cassie (A friend of mine who I am often concerned about, but attracted to. She fits that chronically distressed girl stereotype.) was tired. I had my car, and there was one other car in the bunch. We were at a rest area in a field. It felt like there were eucalyptus trees all around. There was a fancy restaurant nearby. It was a popular picnic/vacation area. My brother Gerald got into some trouble with the police and went somewhere. There was a mean professor-like boss controlling our every move. He was up to no good. Like an evil Professor Kreps (Pulitzer Prize winning professor who advised some of my work). I was on his good side. He had no sense of emotion. We both went into the bathroom. He said I was doing a great job on the class project with the graphic info boxes. I took that as trivial. The sinks each had small, exotic lake creatures living in them. Isn't that inhumane, I thought? The soap would hurt them. People started coming in, and the conversation ended. The cop decided to round all of us up for whatever my brother did. Instead of having our cars all arrayed, he had us line up so we couldn't approach him or get away so easily. I hadn't done anything, but he figured guilt by association. One of those old, Smokey Bear hat cops. One of my brother's friends left then came back in his white custom truck. He tried to get past by running it against a tree, but the tree fell on the cab, crushing it, hitting him on the head, breaking his neck, and causing him to fall out of the car. I ran there. I wasn't fond of him, but he was still a person in distress. I ran, and saw him in a gutter, neck broken. I didn't want to move him, but cars might hit him here. I couldn't just leave him. I slowly straightened his neck. I heard a silent scream; since he could have been paralyzed, his brain was talking louder. I lifted him, and he kept his neck straight. He could walk, but I said, don't move, keep your head absolutely still. You might be able to walk now, but the slightest movement could paralyze you for life. You don't want that. I'm going to get help. Don't move -- and don't worry, nothing will happen. As I ran to get help, I saw my friend Cassie semi-nude waddling toward the bathroom. Contemptuous. I went to the cluster of officers for help. They ran toward the scene. I told them what had happened and they immediately responded. Next... I was helping with a murder case near the civic center in the fantasy school where I ran to catch the bus that was shaped like a theme park. I got a parking pass, and parked on the edge of downtown behind a red phone booth in a tow yard owned by an Indian guy. "
"037"	"(05/11/08)"	"Sue, the co-worker from the college newspaper I was attracted to, was swimming with me. It was a pool party, and there were games. People jumping in, going for a ball, or something like that. I was melancholy about something, she offered advice. We were going camping next, and she helped me set up... Later, I drove to my high school sweetheart Cindy's house on mother's day. I opened the door, went inside, and prepared to be waiting there with some pastries. I chickened out. I  left, with my dog in the car. Lauren (my high school sweetheart Cindy's sister) saw me drive away. She came out. She called me. I said I was ""in the neighborhood"" and wanted to say ""hi."" She was the first to wake up. I then went to a pool area where I found we'd got a lot of multi-colored geckos, snakes and turtles. My old turtle was hungry -- but the food had all been replaced with teeny tiny little turtles. A rainbow gecko had fallen into my turtle's tank; the turtle lunged and swallowed it nearly all the way. I expected the nippy snappy to have cut the thing in half, but it didn't. It swallowed it like a snake. But the gecko wriggled free, unscathed. I took it out and set it free. But it bit me multiple times, almost drawing blood. I touched a poison dart frog. Just brushed it. I began to feel strange almost immediately. I tried to feed crickets to some of the critters, but the bag was filled with tiny turtles. My mother came home and went out into the pool area where I was slumped down near a chair or mini bar. I said I'd been bitten by a mamba or something, but had taken the correct anti-venom; I had earlier and had the healing bite mark to prove it on my right arm."
"038"	"(05/11/08)"	"I was driving with my mother and a friend to Iraq. We were approaching through Saudi Arabia or another quasi-friendly country. I was tired, so my mother offered to drive. After a moment, I said I'd take over -- it would draw more attention if my mother was driving. I was worried they'd find the drugs in the glove compartment if we were stopped -- they could have search dogs at the checkpoint. We got in and I went to the beach with my friends Andrew and Nate (friends from college). We walked around, saw some cute international girls, and were making jokes about the pings and occasional zips of bullets that zinged past. Everyone started laughing. An Iraqi policeman was making gestures with his gun, like it was making the noises. He had just a small pistol. Then I saw a dark, shrouded terrorist-looking shape in a doorway near a cargo container. I yelled, Officer! Policia ! Look! Terrorist! I pointed, and ran across the fine, dirty sand. Then they all lined up, wearing revolutionary military olive uniforms with Arab squiggles. They charged, I ducked into an alley between shanties. One came sprinting, and I stood in a shadow. I jumped out, tripped him, and began pounding his face with my fists until he was still. As I made the initial lunge, I thought, he's just a punk kid recruited by this shitty demagogue. He's no soldier. That may or may not have been true. Bottom line, I surprised him, and here I was, bashing his face in. Once he was down and out, I had to be sure he'd stay that way. I took off his helmet and dispatched him with it with three blows to his head. I took his gun, and his bandolier. I sprinted down the road to where Barack Obama was doing a book signing with limited security. He wanted to make a statement. I ran up with my gun back and hand forward, palm out and fingers splayed, a gesture of, ""I mean you no harm."" The sage saw this, and told his lone security man to ignore the gun, that I meant them no harm. I told them to get down and take cover. They ducked into a shanty. I told them, and we went out. One was approaching. The gun had come unloaded. It was an M1Garrand, not an AK as I'd expected. I took a clip out of the bandolier and loaded it. It took a moment, but it was simple enough. I held it out and looked down the sights. It was simple enough. But the sights were a little bent. Oh well, I'd make due. I had to go back for Nate and Andrew -- before I ran for help, I stood for a moment and thought, god, I can't just leave them. I began to sprint back, with Barak and a couple of his men behind me. Then they walked toward me; hey! They were released. I let Andrew check out my M-1. "
"039"	"(05/12/08)"	"I went back to the town where I went to college, surprising most there. I went to the college park office, and then back to my old building. I went inside. I saw that Ramy, behind my back, had rented the place out to one of the Joe-crowd rabblers. (Ramy is a former college roommate.) My room was being lived in by a timid, younger kid, the sensitive little indie type who cries when people bash him on xbox live. His name was like Corey or Derek or something like that. I told him he needed to pay $200 per month, and I'd throw in a free cordless phone, because that's what he said was ""being in the future."" Later, I visited Michelle and Neil (neighbors who were my friends). As always, they were happy to see me. They let me stay over. I watched Desperate Housewives, but the episode cut off at a really dramatic point. I had to go, but also really wanted to see the conclusion. Neil had put that, and a lot of other books in my backpack. Good guy."
"040"	"(05/12/08)"	"I woke up naked for some reason, and wrapped myself in a towel. I climbed out on the porch roof -- the house was similar to the summit view place. I looked down, like in call of duty, and prepared to snipe someone or something like that."
"041"	"(05/16/08)"	"Going on a trip. Monkey that is really a cat that is really hairy. Inside a zoo along the way. It is hurricane-force winds. I get down. Everyone else follows suit as we walk down the mountain. My sister gets high on a spliff from Ali Mellis (someone I went hiking with). Everyone is tired, and I am constantly thinking about water supplies. I am on a road trip through some strange road area, where there are multiple water parks. We're looking for one, but it is terribly out of the way. The others look like a lot of fun, but we want to find this one. I have a good sense of map in my head. We come under attack from a call of duty helicopter."
"042"	"(05/18/08)"	"I get a girl to come on to my friend Andrew. We throw them on the trunk of a car and take off. We being me and some of her girlfriends who think it would be funny. We tell Andrew she is all hot for him, and he makes his move. He gets confident, cocky in his advances, and eventually they kiss as the car races through town. He touches her leg, her breast, and they kiss. Andrew humps her lips with his face. I grimace, and yell, ""you're doing it all wrong! That's disturbing, and disgusting and embarrassing!"" There's his camera on the seat. I start taking pictures through the back seat glass. The car goes over a bump, and Andrew is thrown off. We lost him. I say to go back to look for him, but fear he's died. At least he died doing something he's never done before."
"043"	"(05/24/08)"	"Girl in the Starbucks/bar who I keep making eye contact with. She's gorgeous, caring, nice ... her dad is mean, doesn't want me anywhere near her. We go on a road trip somewhere. We sit together. I make Bruce (a half-brother, age 2) cry. She has straight dark brown hair, a long angelic face, and warm eyes. She's obviously hot, and everyone looks at her that way. And wants her, but think they can't have her. I see her eyes, and they tell me a lot. We are going somewhere, and she comes with me against her father's wishes."
"044"	"(06/04/08)"	"I was working at a newspaper, and was sent out on a story. I wound up at a gas station. I needed to get gas, and some other stuff. But I was stressed about my job. I bought all kinds of useless stuff that I didn't need. I also bought some tobacco from a vending machine, and a packet of sugar that I'd already opened. I went to the counter to return them. The packet tobacco -- I couldn't use it, unless I chewed it or ate it... and who wants to do that? The lady behind the counter took the return in her hand in different pieces. ""What sexual addiction do you want that will kill you?"" she asked. I took American spirit cigarettes, the yellow organic pack. Then I went on to work. The roads were completely flooded, but I drove through anyway. I met A co-worker I was attracted to at the office. She was working on a big story. With her, my feelings come out as a mix of love, jealousy and respect."
"045"	"(06/12/08)"	"There was a competition going on. A battle in an old World War II European city. I had to complete several obstacles, like cross the beam, knock down the pins, and match up colored icons. There was a giant robot with a lot more xp and points than me. It had missiles and my attacks were fruitless..."
"046"	"(06/12/08)"	"later, I was trying to stay awake. I was with a friend and Kristen Needles (a photograph friend) in an apartment. She was doing lines off a table. I wanted to try some, so I sniffed a line. I almost snorted into the big pile. She cut up more with a credit card, and dumped some liquid coke that turned into a powder from a benzoil peroxide-based facial cleanser bottle. I then ate a large amount. I felt buzzy. Then I woke up and kept coming back. When awake, I expected to still be buzzed... I used it as an excuse. ""If I take this, I have no excuse to stay asleep."""
"047"	"(06/15/08)"	"I was in a theme park-type place. It's flat, lower budget. More like a historical old-time city, like what the city where I first worked would look like if the tourism industry took over. Sort of like if it became more like a nearby tourist city."
"048"	"(06/16/08)"	"I am waiting for my mother outside Wal Mart. She is taking too long to pick me up because I suspect she is distracted. She's turned into an impertinent, rude, stupid person lately. When she finally does arrive, I call her on it. She is having long phone chats with someone. A dentist named Barry, an older guy who works near the old dentist place near Wal Mart. I demand to meet him, so I stay in the back seat of the mini van until she goes over there to see him. He seems like a nice enough guy. He gets out of his car and gets into the front seat. I shake his hand. He says something. I lean forward because I can't quite hear. ""Nice to meet you"" is all I say. I want to fight back tears at this betrayal. I don't let him notice. The exchange is brief. I get out and disappear into a dark space, then re-emerge deep underground."
"049"	"(06/16/08)"	"It's a man-made labyrinth of windowless, doorless passages, the walls covered with a cushy material, like the padded carpet inside a cubicle. I run fast, barely able to see in the dark. I realize that this place is my new place of residence. I'm interning here. On this planet, people have been forced deep underground. It's safe, but endlessly dreary. I shudder at the thought of spending eternity wandering these halls, that seem to warp as I run. I don't know my way. I wonder, will I ever get used to this place, be able to pick out one gray, faceless turn after the other? I eventually come out into a chamber, where two short people are. They are stiff and talk in script like video game characters. They explain to me why their height is so small. I say, ""Why am I so tall?"" They are benevolent. The bald one in a dark suit was my boss, but also nice. I look out the ""window"", into a lighted cavern outside and a giant green toy story alien appeared. It reached in and was benevolent. I wondered, why does my university alma mater have a partnership with Disney so these characters wander around during games? Probably because the university is in a strange state. No other place has this. Visitors ought to be impressed. Next I was in a gameworks type place, but with a high tech laser tag game. I had an empty pistol holster and an automatic weapon, an smg with a large digital IR scope. I can turn it to see around corners. It was modified to shoot the special beams. This was like paintball -- bring your own gun. I was scanned at the door when I went in by a skinny, long-haired bouncer type.. It was like being welcomed to an exclusive club. For $10 I also got 100 tickets to buy gun upgrades and the like."
"050"	"(06/25/08)"	"In a city where crime families run rampant. They rule by manipulation, influence and the perception of unchangeable tradition, ""it's always been this way,"" more so than violence. To gain political clout, they kidnap people and interbreed with them. Like the one blonde woman who was captured years ago, made to marry a boss and who I interviewed in her front yard that looked like a house our family once lived in, with the salvia bed and impatiens under the palm. She had a slip of the tongue, where she said something like, ""back when they took me to this house"" or something that indicated that she wanted rescuing. I asked to confirm, did you just say ___? she said yes -- she uttered a code word. I arrested the guy. The case I was currently working on was like that. It involved a scion of the bunch setting up another young girl -- her daughter -- to be kidnapped in a similar way. Though this one may have gone awry. Remember, this place was more and more governed by violence. I was just a reporter -- but they quickly deputized me when I found myself in deeper than most of the clueless cops -- who had looked the other way for generations, because ""that's the way it's been."" But when the outside influence began creeping in, to clean things up, they were met with huge resistance--a limo full of thugs got into a gun fight. I took some out from a balcony window. I had a James Bond ppk, and also a fallen bad guy's magnum revolver. I joked about going in with both -- or even going in with two sawed-off shotguns, two over-under guns and a high-tech pump gun. We were low on weapons and heavy-duty ammo. we had a supply of Thompsons, but they were in pieces and disrepair. Standard-issue guns weren't quite enough. I wanted a new hk ump or something -- but they just weren't available. I also remember teaming up with the sister of one of the kidnapped people, who was in the station for questioning. She suggested I keep behaving the way I was -- it's why they gave her the add pills. Looking at all the mess of discarded half-empty clips, malfunctioning guns, obsolete revolvers on the floor of the hotel-turned police headquarters. Earlier, I was trying to track people down through phone records and calls made through a central node. They were in this lakeside residential neighborhood, around the constantly rain-soaked downtown area. It's as if the computer age met the age where lines were still connected by hand. I'd gotten a list from the phone girl. The pills are how the girl from the family keeps skinny. I was knocked out in a car. But I awoke and overheard the story of how something happened -- how the people fought each other, and how they were going to or did abduct the kid with the help from the kid in the family selling out his own cousin. It's about family betrayal and politics."
"051"	"(06/30/08)"	"I was on a road trip, and stopped off at a Wal-Mart, with an RV-tailgate area in the parking lot. I was with a few friends... but we were really like bounty hunters or soldiers of fortune. It was an island kind of like the one in the video game Halo 1 ... long story short, I was inside the store, and people started shooting. I took that as a cue to use the diversion as an advantage. I went in and grabbed as many guns as possible. I looked for the flashy ones, the big ones and the expensive ones. Magnum revolvers. Old, big pistols. Cross-bow conversions. Long-range rifles. We had small arms in the Winnebago. I later went on the run, being chased and hiding in a canal. It was filled with algae. I climbed a fence. I came out later on a golf course and was running from a helicopter that had an easy time spotting me in the open."
"052"	"(07/22/08)"	"After going out into a mangrove bay for a midnight kayak trip off a large pleasure boat for nighttime navigation, the canoe overturned and was swamped. I was practicing with Stephanie Haroldson (a friend from college, and now a co-worker) how to turn it over and get the water out. We got moving once the guide showed up. We then tromped into the woods. Mosquitoes. And then came the swarm of horseflies around the endless carpet of low, spiky sticky lily type plants. and then we decided to go elsewhere... to a snow-covered mountain. Me and the weekend gang from where I went to college were barreling down without skis or sleds. I zoomed. Then skidded at the bottom. It was great. Then we went up again. The operator said we were lucky, that he only sent the huge gondola up three times per day. But once we came down again, sliding, still with clothes on (yeah, Vanessa, or was it Justin?) didn't want to go unless we did it naked -- both are friends from college with that kind of attitude). We went on again and because we didn't want to get naked, Justin didn't go. The guy said, get ready to freefall. Instead of falling, he joked, and lowered us down. I joked it was like tower of terror. We went up, and..."
"053"	"(07/22/08)"	"I dreamed of my former girlfriend Karen. It was a mix of lust, jealousy, want and affection. I was with her in an older house, hybrid of summit view and vista place. We went upstairs. She wanted to talk and was flirtatious. I left her briefly and when I returned it had rained and everyone was gathered in a high-school like hall lobby, where a dance party was taking place. I was looking very much forward to dancing with her. But she was dancing with some other guy, my polar opposite, the tall typical white fratty guy. It hurt, but I let her go without saying anything. She was the type who couldn't be cloistered. And I felt that her heart was true. If she really did care, it wouldn't mean a thing. I walked to the back of the room, into the theater area. It was dark. Safe."
"054"	"(07/31/08)"	"I was on assignment to cover both an amusement park something or the other (a race?) and a military homecoming/departure. I was just dropped into the setting -- unaware of where I was. But I saw a sign on the highway -- I was 13 miles from the city where I had my first newspaper job. It had the blue and red shield-shaped interstate markers. There were palm trees. The people there talked candidly. One was trying to get his two dogs, breeder dogs, into a pen in the back of his truck. He wore heavy sunglasses -- his vision was failing. But he was chipper. Many of the parents were somber, and one even said, ""there are a lot fewer dead this time"" I said, ""really, is that so?"", so I could get a response to speak to the fact that yeah, this was a good month -- only 5 dead instead of 20."
"055"	"(07/31/08)"	"I got sidetracked at a theme park type place where me and my brother Gerald were getting into this race around a track with three other super-fast go karts. The tracks crossed. We were in the lead for most of the time, even going the alternate passing way. But on the last lap, a car turned a corner faster than we did and jetted slightly ahead. But on the final turn, I took it on the inside, and cut just in front. The other car hit us, and we went skittering. It was unclear who won. But then the organizer, Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs, but with a strange name and more off persona like ChrisAangel, called up the replay -- we'd spun just across the line and won. I spoke with him, he gave background, etc. and his strange name. My brother Gerald got his phone number. When I got back to the office to write the story -- the office was in the downstairs of one of the houses we once lived in, it appeared, and I had two stories and very limited time. Somewhere earlier there was also a quest for Starbucks in a wet, rainy lifestyle center type place, with a cold ice cream store like the Hagen Daas we always went to in my home town with the wicker chairs. I forgot to ask him how he came to do what he did, he said ""just trying to make a buck."" But I wanted to know more. I called him with my brother Gerald's phone, but the number was not working because his carrier was overloaded. I wondered if he put in the number right, but figured he did."
"056"	"(07/31/08)"	"The part of the dream about my former girlfriend Karen is remarkable. It was as if I knew her-- her voice, words, quirks and comments --they all seemed like her, or at least how I imagine her to be. We are in the front yard of a 70s-style coral stone house. The landscaping is lush, and the deep green grass in front is thick. She and I roll around in it, and we play fight. Just earlier, I had been locked in the bathroom of a local pharmacy, and inside was an examining room where the patient had just left.  I was accidentally locked inside. I pounded on the door without panic for someone to open it. I was more angry they could let such a hazard exist. There was a brown pair of old person's pants with the belt still attached in the examination chair. I then upped the ante, and kicked down the door after I saw the person outside wasn't responding-- a delivery guy in a blue short-sleeve button up, like a postman or mechanic. Once I got out and made it to the parking lot, Karen was there. She greeted me with a poster-board sized card, with a loving message written on it. Part of it was in regular writing, but the other part was in colorful marker or color pencil. I was so infatuated with her thoughtfulness and creativity. It was like a giant Facebook message, physically embodied. The word love was in there, but unclear in its meaning, like a ""hey you"". But back to the grass. We moved and played and laid there in the yard. And finally, I pinned her, and I looked down at her face. It was spry, playful, inviting, happy. We stood up, and we kissed. We kept on, and I hoped she enjoyed it. She kissed me back."
"057"	"(08/01/08)"	"I was in a cross between two big cities I have visited, visiting friends and meeting with family. I went off with my sister in search of vampire ribs. Apparently, they were an illegal food, but quite delicious. We didn't have a car, so we took a sky bus with a surprisingly friendly driver. We went around the couple miles -- too far to walk, since it was all gritty and confusing and car-centric city below. We arrived at weekend fair at the fair grounds -- it was only like this during the summer. It was run by gypsies. Long hair, weirdo gypsies. I saw all kinds of food, but realized I'd need to ask someone who knows someone and go into a dark thick tent in order to get to the ribs, which were likely dark and tempting,  oh god so good, so bad for your body and soul."
"058"	"(08/02/08)"	"I'm in the jungle about to go off on an exploratory mission..."
"059"	"(11/19/08)"	"The aura of something dark, a creeping tingling infused with the grim persistence of inevitability, radiated from every wall, carpet fiber and chair. I'd just come in from outside. Out there, I could feel the oily mist of this impending fate thick in the air, on the sunlight as it filtered through haze and ozone, as it backlit the swathes of knuckled cumulus clouds floating like cotton-candy cattle in the sky. Billowy bovines oblivious to their coming dissipation. This wasn't my house I had stepped into. It was small and squat, on the edge of the sea in a town mired in history, but now sagging with the weight of Taco Bells and tourism. The house belonged to friends, though, so I felt safe entering unannounced. I had to get out from under that afflicted afternoon. Before whatever was about to happen happened, I had to have something. I wanted to take a shower. The forthcoming journey, I could sense, would be nigh impossible, let alone make allowance for bathing. And the sheen of fear and finality from the outside was still sticking fast to my skin. I went into the small, square, messy room of one of my friends and asked if I could use his bathroom. He said, ""yes, of course, no problem"" as he dressed himself while seated on an unmade bed, dirty clothes surrounding his feet on the floor. I went inside the door adjoining his room with the dim and musty bathroom. The small space was covered in scummy beige tile from floor to ceiling, and the shower curtain was supposed to be clear, but had grown opaque from uncounted months of accumulated mildew. I stripped and stepped inside. When I turned the squeaky and corroded chrome shower knobs to full and hot, only a gentle cascade of lukewarm water came down on my body. I began to shampoo anyway, using a bottle I found in the shower. Then, as I began to rinse, a young woman came into the bathroom through the partially open door. She had a pretty face, and long auburn hair. Her locks looked artificially straightened, yet somehow remained silky and parallel despite the humidity permeating the atmosphere both in here and outside. Her shirt was dark and lacy like a tea-time doily. Her eyes were green, striking in their clarity, and when they met mine, unspoken words were telegraphed into my skull. She carried with her a malaise. She was sick with something beyond a normal ailment. She started coughing, and her throat clenched from the effort of restraining a gag. She had just come in from the outside. She'd breathed too much of the viscous air, and the stifling weather had siphoned her strength via now-clammy sheets of sweat from every pore. With her entrance, I knew the ethereal blanket now covering everything had changed in character from brooding and ominous to simply malevolent and frightening. The girl blurted an apology for entering unannounced, and in the same breath, bent over the claw-foot tub adjacent to the shower stall. She coughed and whimpered into the basin. When she stood up and hurried away, the water flowing over my shoulders slowed to a trickle and stopped. I felt angry that I still had shampoo in my hair. The anger quickly evaporated. A stench filled the wet little room. My nostrils spasmed, and I felt as if a tremendous flu had taken over my body. It was the bathtub. The porcelain vessel had somehow been filled in an instant, brimming with a morbid stew of something crimson and coagulated, as if a mess of blood and bile had risen from the drain. I leaped from the shower and clambered into the bedroom naked. Nobody was there. I picked up a towel from the floor and hastily gathered my clothes. I dressed, and with each garment I donned, the more surreal I felt. Logic, reality, sanity. They were beginning to wane. This was the last sign. It's one of those feelings where you don't want to believe what is going on, where your mind simply will not let you embrace reality for what it is. And then you get it. You comprehend.  I felt it tight and hollow in my stomach and my chest, in my aching head and reverberating through my bones. The Armageddon was going to happen."
"060"	"(12/27/08)"	"I dreamt that my high school sweetheart Cindy came to visit me while I was staying at grandma's house. Only the room was a mix between the most cluttered of my college apartments and the sparingly decorated extra bedroom upstairs in the house my grandparents have lived for the past quarter-decade. Four monitors were there. Two double displays, a long, modern single display and a smaller computer monitor set aside for my xbox. I wondered at both the waste and the potential utility. But I was please to have such an array -- just think of the organization! She came in as a small bird, burrowing through the ground. When she emerged, she was a woman changed. Or trying to change. The magnetism was there like always, only now, there was little facade of reticence. We seized upon each other, and we fell on the bed, the thick blankets all around. We took off our clothes. It wasn't a ravenous mutual stripping, but more a slow, casual progress toward the inevitable. I could see tattoos on her body. I doubted many were real, but even if they were stick-ons, their placement on her nubile body, the intricate swirls and flowers and dragons, attracted me to her in a new way. There was a mirrored design in that flat space between each of her breasts and shoulders. Her abdomen was covered with more, in attractive, symmetrical columns. I told her I liked this. It was the way she was showing her change. I trusted her, and she trusted me. She lay down, and I lay on top of her, finding my way in. Just like I remembered. Not long after we had started, I felt a paranoia. What can happen, will happen. We should cover up, just in case someone comes in. I reached back and pulled the old white comforter over us. With renewed vigor, I re-attached myself to her. Then a moment later, the door swung open, with a column of relatives at the door. My grandmother and grandfather were there, even though grandpa is long dead. Before I could say a word, Cindy blurted: ""Hello Mr. Grandpa!"" I said something nonsensical, meant to be a rock onto which the sponges of their desire to make an excuse for themselves to grow.  The door did not slam shut again as you would expect. Instead, everyone came in. I rolled over and brought the blankets back atop us. I jumped off the bed and put on pants. She covered up. They filed in. Sean (my 22 year old cousin), his friend, with a strange name, and perhaps others. We talked about miscellanea, and then, they urged us to go to church. I went along with the idea. Soon we were at a place with an exterior reminiscent of the library and art museum complex in the town where I went to high school. Inside was an auditorium, with a quiet, plexi-glass-covered press room and a tall crescent of seats, some of them doubles. Behind me, sat the church regulars. I walked in with my arm around Cindy, but she disappeared as I sat down. She was supposed to be right behind me. No matter. On a raised, square platform framed by a banister of dark-stained, glossy wood, an old woman with triangle-shaped, purple-dyed white hair spoke into a microphone, imploring questions about the scripture from the somewhat thin crowd. But this church was also synonymous with a performing arts center. It was as if the high school auditorium was transferred into a college auditorium near where I went to college, splashed with religious overtones. Grandma was occupied downstairs. She had somehow wanted to know what it was like to retrieve something from an oven herself. She'd shrunk down to an old, bird-like shape, like an owl with my grandma's face, her thinning hair turned into sparse and spotty down feathers. She was trying to carry a platter out from the oven (where the refrigerator is in her current kitchen setup) on her head, raised up with skinny, wing-like arms. How was she withstanding the heat? I said she needed to duck down a bit to make it out. Instead, she shrunk, turning into a tiny bird with an egg on her head, with curved, pin-like feathers sticking from the top, with pollen-like heads at the tips, like the stems inside a hibiscus flower. I washed her in the sink , careful not to knock off the intricate and endearing head display. But it fell into the garbage disposal. She was the size of a finch. In the middle of the question and answer sermon, a screen came down. Cindy had gone to do another performance. A voice from behind me, a peer-aged girl of hers, a sometimes friend, said ""not this one again. It's overrated."" But when the images flashed on the horizontal rectangular screen, with hues of indigo and white, edges rough like a blueprint, I saw that her dance was more a model strut than anything else. Her henna-tattooed body writhed around a pole that extended up and down to infinity. She floated throw the air, trails of black star fire and sparkle behind her. Her chest was bare. Her oval breasts tinted gray in the filter. And in her final pose, an angle that surveyed her body from high above, the bones in her pelvis stretched the band of her thong just far enough to see the bump of her clitoris emerge from the horizon of her flat and toned abdomen. I said to myself, ""I hope all these people know I'm doing that."" The show ended, and another woman with purple hair had taken to the platform, this time, shifted o the other side of the stage area. The original was now in the crowd. I raised my hand to ask a question, but put it down as the church women behind me chuckled to themselves that I should wait to see how things worked. I put my hand down, and some fat young man asked a stupid question. I wanted to ask about shellfish. The women asked what church I go to. I said non-denominational. I paused for a moment, and added, lying, Unitarianism . I waited to see their balk. Then the first purple-haired woman walked up the side-aisle, and an announced her name, followed by ""denominational""."
"061"	"(01/04/09)"	"My mind became the World of Warcraft. I saw that my former girlfriend Karen was logged in for some reason. I wanted to just casually jibe here -- her tree-like character had a nose that looked exactly like hers. It was like the face in the wood along the Rainbow River. She was a trunk, with branch-like arms that stretched up, with maple-shaped amber leafs hanging from the limbs. I was logged in with a cell phone-type device; like a Samsung, foreign cell phone/computer. It was small. I struggled with the keyboard. I wanted to send her a message: ""Karen ! Your character's nose looks exactly like it does in real life!?"" A little insult, but fun, playful. In a way, jibing her, I felt, would cause her to somehow like me more. I saw she was at the beach at first, under a pier near her house. I saw her there through the screen. But when I got there, I saw she had run into the woods, and was standing in the middle of a road. I ran to her, but then she took off. She disappeared . She was headed toward a soccer complex I know. I went after her, but when I got there, I found there were a few creatures there beyond my level. I was using just the player I only use occasionally, so I was still vulnerable. A boar, a red, blood-rage boar attacked me. It had jagged red markings on it. Bloodlust. It came at me, and I didn't think I could fight it. So I ran. And as I ran, I ran near the concrete wall that separated the hard area (soccer fields) from the tamer zone (near the bathroom/concession stand). I grabbed the board by the neck as it neared, and steered it into the wall. It collided, smashed its head, and died. Do I get experience for that?, I thought. I looked around for Karen, but instead, I only encountered more creatures. This time, in the easier area. A horse. A bull. A goat. The goat came at me, and I grabbed it by the horns. I had my Gerber pocket knife. I knew I could kill it, but I didn't want to. It was just a goat. I held it until it passed out. Next, a bull-like creature charged. Each time, I grabbed it, and threw it toward the ground. It got injured until it expired. Then, horses, dozens, came running. They were the riders of Rohan, fresh from a victory. It was like after a big college football game, when the people stream into the streets. And then Karen, with all of her girlfriends, came up. She seemed so happy to see me. I saw her, called her name, and then she turned to me. Her eyes lit up. She was drunk, but the sentiment meant something to me all the same. She ran toward me, and wrapped her arms around my neck. She kissed me. She kissed me hard. I kissed her back. I was surprised how she was this way in front of her friends. But I liked it. It made me happy, that she would take enough pride in me to launch such a display of affection. She said, ""Eric, I missed you. It's you, I can't believe it. I've been waiting for this. You're so special to me."" But, like always, she had to go. She had to get to Chicago. ""But I want to stay and sleep,"" she said. I knew the ""with you"" was implied. I envisioned my room in my college apartment. The smell. The sheets."
"062"	"(01/05/09)"	"I dreamed that I was back in the town where I went to college for another graduation party. Talked to Delaney (a roommate in my college apartment) in the back yard. Then I was taken in by a super-rich couple. The husband was gay and they were living a sham marriage. The wife wanted sex. Back in the hostel, Sarina (a British girl I met when visiting another country) from the top bunk tacitly offered sex. I wasn't sure what she was saying, so I replied tacitly as well. She climbed  up, then looked my way, and climbed back down. The gulf of the little room was too great for me to cross. She came to me, and climbed into bed. I pulled the covers over us. I lifted her shirt up , touched her breasts. Put my leg between her bare legs. She said if she knew, she would have shaved. I came quickly, but shot it into her mouth, I was ready to go again immediately. First, I smeared my ejaculate all over her chest."
"063"	"(01/05/09)"	"I'm with the group of girls from the hostel. I go with them and follow them around as they shop. It's like an elite discovery channel or national geographic store. Bored, I go off to the kids section and look at all the toy maps. I wish I could have had these as a kid. I would love to look off into ""here be dragons."""
"064"	"(01/25/09)"	"I dreamt I was pressured into robbing a Mexican bank. When I got caught, I was taken to the jail, but before they put me in handcuffs, I took $5,000 of the $100,000 I stole and put it in my back pocket. When one of my accomplices accidentally caused a distraction, I hid under the floor. Then I snuck out and stole a motor scooter. It didn't go very fast. So the bad Mexican cop on a motorcycle came up behind me. I turned into a suburb, parked outside of a house, and ran through a back yard where a family was eating dinner. The two Mexican policemen on the motorcycle jumped off and ran after me. I had run in a circle, came back, and stole their bigger motorcycle. I took off, but I found the clutch was broken, so I still couldn't go that fast. But I made it home... and still had $5000 in tattered bills in my pocket. Driving through the town where I went to high school, driving in front of a store in one of the malls, there was a ramp that I was forced to go up on the motorcycle. I almost crashed when I landed and had to dodge cars."
"065"	"(01/28/09)"	"There was a mass exodus. I was among them in the masses. We were running from something. From a war. From a storm. From a force more malevolent and powerful than we could handle. So we ran. We kept going. Past a stadium. We were being funneled, officially. But I threw those corrals out the window and just took a way around a little ravine. Then, finally, we were all settled into a sprawling field. Thousands and thousands, set in a field, in a neighborhood. Along and through the streets of a tree-lined residential neighborhood, the suburbs, now turned into a refugee camp. And the disorganization and the fear were palpable. Each group stayed to themselves. Nobody knew if their neighbor spoke the same language, or believed in the same things, or wanted the same result. I was among them. I felt isolated, alone. Then someone began an organization. He stood up, and began talking to the masses, teaching them, rallying them around a central cause. Why hadn't I thought of doing this? Teach them a common language. Launch a common ideal. Rally together despite our disparity. And so, I moved through the crowd, teaching them this ideal. I was one of the teachers. One of the ones with the power to change and move the people. It seemed like minutes, but really, I think months passed. Then, we were ready. The world again began stitching itself back to normal. Whatever force had us pressed down in these camps had been pushed back. But, still, I continued on -- not teaching this time, but learning. I found my way onto a massive Norwegian submarine or something of the sort. It was a quick journey, out and back, but in the brief time, I learned much. When I got back to the port, a pretty area with simple but elegant planted gazebos and long rectangular lawns with delicate, very green grass, I immediately knew I needed to go back out on one of these ships. But I needed a translator. I found a young woman. I knew her. She was mysteriously attractive. She was a lesser rival, or competing agent or something. But she coyly accompanied me when I had her board the ship with me. We ignored the ""all non-men will be landsided "" or something like that. This was an old-fashioned shipping vessel. As it were, we went out, and the views were fantastic. Purple and pink and fuschia sunrises from the clean-lines of the balcony. I had my cell phone with me the whole while. I kept getting strange messages."
"066"	"(01/28/09)"	"We went to a McDonald's. She paid. She had turned into my former girlfriend Karen. The guy behind the counter, a ghetto-type guy, knew me and said, ""Thanks, E"" or something, and gave me back the change in foreign coins. I wanted to do him a favor and impress Karen . So I saw that Mr. Hughes (a high school teacher, mentor) was working behind the counter. An opera-type song was playing in the restaurant. The employee began singing along. Interesting match -- the guy with cornrows behind his McVisor singing opera. I said, ""You should really meet up with this guy,"" gesturing to Mr. Hughes, who was a theater aficionado. ""He's the best opera singer around."" And so, they met. And I went to a different counter. Karen went to another counter to the right. There, Mr. Hughes questioned her about what we were doing. ""So, the two of you going somewhere to do things?"" or something. She gave back a coy answer. He smirked. He assumed what I wanted him to assume. She was with me, in fact, but not ""with"" me. That's when I decided I wasn't going to play her game. I left and went off on my own, trying to catch a bus. She enjoyed my company, but didn't want to take things further. I wouldn't have that. But then I found that my shoes had gone missing. My black hiking shoes. Then I found them, wet and soaked. Inside, though, there was a cryptic message. It was like a fortune cookie valentine. I received two more. The last said something like, ""go play the game with her, and play for t-bone steaks like tebow."" Somehow, these were her way of telling me she liked me. Strange girl. I started setting up the game. There were these two douche bags playing the game, where, I think, you bowled or threw small wooden balls toward this target lined with cards and tokens with prizes or bonuses behind them. As I was pinning the cards into place, I tried to glance at what was behind some of them so I knew where to aim. But ultimately, I knew I would play with Karen on my team. We'd be a team. And she finally gave in to her feelings."
"067"	"(01/28/09)"	"The game was interrupted and I found myself walking down the road in front of one of the houses our family once lived in. Near the speedway. I've dreamt of walking or driving around here before. There was a big city show going on. It was like the downtown where I went to college is now. There was one display that was now underground. A friend of my father's was there, setting it up. He was like a building contractor. ""The display was so popular last year, the people practically tore the thing apart hitting all the buttons."" So now it's more secure in an underground bunker with CIA-level security."
"068"	"(01/28/09)"	"I kept going to a locker that was supposed to have been assigned to me in a swimming pool clubhouse, but the key didn't work. The place outside was like the downtown of the town where I went to high school, with the pier 1 imports and rooms to go and other places I don't like.  I had people from work with me. I was trying to do work, but it was difficult. Some friends traveled with me as I tried to find a store that was selling the thing I needed then -- a computer or a car."
"069"	"(01/29/09)"	"I was having sexual intercourse with my high school sweetheart Cindy. I was doing it long and hard. She'd cummed all over herself. Her vagina was a frothy mess. I kept pounding her. I was working my way into her. But we knew her parents were coming home. Oh well. I wanted to finish. But then I saw her parents' white minivan pull up through the window. We stopped just as they walked in. I turned on the TV and a movie just started. It was a dumb movie, Home Alone. I put on pants really fast. But there was no hiding it. ""That's sex hair if I ever saw it,"" her dad said. I said something stupid, like, ""we were just trying to finish the movie -- get to the part where he battles the guys, shoots them with the bb gun."""
"070"	"n/a"	"(01/29/09 [nap]) Trying to use the computer in my uncle's store in another country. The police have come by. Somebody has stolen something. It's not bad, but the police are strangely responsive. Why? There is political unrest about. A demagogue is rallying his troops to prey on xenophobia and fears of terrorism. I'd taken hundreds of photos. I was trying to set up my computer. I hid it underneath the frozen pizzas, my computer. The store is like a small grocery store, the kind with an Asian bent. The air is thick with the smell of raw fish and vegetables soaking into the walls for many unbroken years."
"071"	"(01/30/09)"	"It was a rainy place, but the buildings were tall and glass and concrete. Inside was safe, albeit a bit gray and musty. The signs were greenish. The culture here was Asian, and the place I was staying, martial arts predominated as a pastime. I was taking atae kwan do class. Only it was special, mystical, more advanced. The teacher was a big guy, that very typical westerner who uses immersion into an aspect of Asian culture to help him forge some individuality, or re-invent his identity. He reminded me of Doug (a friend from college who dealt drugs and enjoyed practicing kung fu), but more self-assured in his form. I took the class. Suddenly, I found myself wearing a uniform. The uniform was more decorated than the others. The other students all wore white. Mine was white, but with black hems. At the end of the class, the instructor announced, does anyone want to spar? I said, ""Me, I'm black belt certified. I can fight."" I was feeling the tickles of adrenaline begin to spine into my system, throttling up my heart, tensing the muscles behind my eyes. ""You're black belt certified,"" he asked? He was getting ready to fight anyway, eager to take on one of his challenging students. ""Yes. I'm ready now,"" I said. The other students stepped back. A small rectangular ring materialized on the floor. It was always there, cordoned off by white lines of tape. I ignored it until now. He started in right away. I said ""woah, woah. Wait. We need to bow first."" He said, ""oh, right. Sorry."" We bowed, took positions, then began. He was much bigger than me, towering over me by what seemed like a head. He was big, perhaps a bit fat. I'd need to punch hard, and deep. I needed to find openings in his defenses, and make each punch drill into his core, using the shockwaves to reverberate through his fat and muscle. When we began fighting, I went inward a little. This was the mystical aspect of fighting here. Fighting was more than just fists and kicks. A HUD came up. It showed my training level -- 60. And his -- 100. This wasn't a fair fight. But I knew, for my level of training, I was better than most. During the first round, he didn't land a single solid blow. I hit him in the chest three, four, five times with rapid-fire bursts. But somehow, the announcer said I'd lost the first round. The second round began. I had a renewed vigor. I knew I'd need to hit him even harder. I did at least as well as the first round. Again, I'd lost. And then, the third round. I hit him more in this round than the previous two combined, mostly with pummeling punches to his chest; I found that he left an area open between his arms when he raised them up to protect his face. Because I was shorter, I was able to jab upward, and hit him square in the sternum. He didn't hit me once. But again, the judge registered the round as a loss for me. He said, ""good match,"" and went off. I vowed to train harder. Then, the judge came up. I asked to see the replay. It showed on my HUD, from his perspective. He was using power-ups! This fight wasn't about raw skills, punches, kicks and damage. It was about points scored. And his power-ups, which, apparently, he'd spent most of his training working on, were worth a lot of points. Advanced speed. Rapid block. Heath boost. One after the other, at the beginning of the battle, he'd buffed up. These third-level boosts were apparently worth more than all my punches combined. And he didn't even need to hit me. I caught up with him, and said, ""hey, that's not fair -- you used special moves. You didn't even hit me."" He said, ""Yeah, well, if I hit you, I could have taken your head off in one punch."" Yeah, right. I'd like to have seen him try. I pulled up my own HUD. Wow. Lo and behold, I had buffs of my own. Mostly level 1, with a few level two. There were four levels, to my knowledge. You can't get any buffs until much later levels anyway. This system wasn't competition. I wanted a fight. The judge, she picked up on this. She offered to take me on in a fight without power-ups. I said, ""yes, thank you."" We went to a parking lot, and began to fight. She came at me fast and furious, with spins and kicks. I was able to dodge these. But her specialty, low disabling kicks, and especially ground-level leg sweeps, were tricky. They tripped me up. I didn't fall, but I looked foolish in trying to avoid these moves. I wasn't able to land a punch. The round ended. She'd won the first round. The human judges here, they work in intangibles. The HUD, strictly form and score. She'd used more advanced moves, and was ranked higher. The second round began . This time, I was ready. When she moved in close, I grabbed her, and threw her. She stumbled and nearly went down. She was a tall woman, solid, with bones that seemed larger than most men's '. But I was still stronger, and faster. She wasn't as high rank as the teacher, but still higher than me -- a rank around 75 or 80. The second round ended. The colored bars on the scoreboard in the HUD flashed green -- her victory. And then red -- my victory. The third round began. It ended in a draw -- it was interrupted. The restaurant opened up in the parking lot, and people began to walk in from all around. It was a Thai-style western establishment. Like KFC. And then as I walked in, the people working there were the hopeless crowd in the town where I went to high school. Cayla, Michelle, those people (who I went to high school with). They were wearing those damn company branded polo shirts, looking at me with that same cockeyed look that I can never figure out. Almost as if they're waiting for the next stupid thing for me to say."
"072"	"(01/30/09)"	"I am in a place that reminds me of Italy. Studying abroad. I'm part of a program with my roommates from Brussels -- Katie, Ashley. We have a mission to do. Sort of clandestine. Other friends, closer friends come to help. I end up getting lost around the big company elevators in the main building in the company tower that's rising from the middle of this old city. I need to get inside to get some documents for what I think is a story. I end up in a wine store and get turned around in the old viaducts that are made from old brick and such."
"073"	"(02/03/09)"	"A horrible series unfolded. I was a sadistic killer. It began when I was visiting family friends who had a house in Thailand. I had the feeling I had been there before, but didn't have any direct recollection. So, when most of the people were out, I took one of them into a back room, pissed in a tray, and made her eat out of it until she threw up. I planned on doing worse, but felt sick myself and wished I wasn't doing what I was doing. It was like killing an animal out of mercy. You try to make it as quick as possible, but the sickening moment when you know suffering, no matter how fast, is inevitable... It makes your stomach turn. You want to look away from what your hands are doing. The place is square, with a steel roof and concrete floors."
"074"	"(02/03/09)"	"Had another dream, but I don't remember it. The vibes of it, though, remind me of a dream I had in the past where I was floating -- or trying to get around -- in this very Southern California-like place that had concrete-bottomed inner-city rivers, like lion country safari water park wild rivers in the city where I was born. I was in a meeting, trying to climb a tree off in a park area a little ways away from the network of rivers that were abused by the public. My bike was laying down under one of the trees. The concrete rivers were far ranging, but in many parts, hazardous and drained with hazards like shopping carts in them. I wanted to jump across and play, but felt inhibited, like I was being watched. Someone came up to me as I was under the tree. There were red berries there -- firm, and poisonous, like the kind behind my neighbor's house when I lived in the city where I was born as a kid."
"075"	"(02/08/09)"	"I dreamed that Barack Obama was my father. I'd never felt so awe-struck around any man before in my life. It was as if he was on tour. He came to visit me in Thailand. I met him and his large limo. We visited a school. He was spouting wisdom with every step. I felt energized and exhilarated just being in his presence. I felt like I was somehow a better man to be in his entourage. I didn't want any special treatment, being around him. But from the jaw-drop reactions, the paralyzed stares as we walked around, it was hard not to feel special. Before we went to the school, we stopped at a gas station/clothing store. Obama jumped in with fervor, selecting acceptable, but still down to earth and local clothes. He pulled out one coat, a pair of slacks, and folded them over his arm. Who cares if I thought the clothes were a bit off. He's the president, and more than that, he is who he is. His clothes would work either way. While he was meticulously selecting his wardrobe for his Asia tour to look more local, and to contribute to the local workers, I sat with Jasmine, a woman I met on a trip, who met me at the garage. I told her, Barack Obama is my father. She said she didn't know who that was. Inside, I was incredulous. I was embarrassed and I liked her a whole lot less. She followed with us the rest of the trip, and I felt ashamed in front of Obama to have her along. At least she knows who Britney Speares is. I walk alongside him. He's tall, almost like a lanky giant. Taller than most men. And we go to a classroom. There, he talks to the students, but says to me, son, let's walk. Tell me about your school, your plans. I felt embarrassed telling him my petty aspirations. I'm writing a book. He's written two. I'm going to write for a new newspaper, which writes about him every day. He sounds impressed. I tell him about adventures sneaking into a dorm. We are on a campus, after all. He doesn't seem to get it. Maybe I'm not explaining it right. We go back after circling the campus. He mixes up the state's main public university with one of the other state universities. I tell him that's like calling a boy a girl. He has a test now. He leaves and comes back two minutes later with a box. Inside are a few sheets of white paper with instructions handwritten. We'd need to find our way to a point, then watch for a splash of a pebble in the water, then get the pebble out -- or something to that affect. The other boy playing along -- they dive in and randomly search for the rock, shaped like a mitten hand, until they come up with one -- but it's the wrong one. They didn't follow instructions. He is quiet along the bank, runs up and throws the right rock then hides among the muddy weeds. Can he do that? Didn't they see him? I guess not. He took a gamble. And aren't there massive crocodiles in this lake? Couldn't the boys get hurt? I found a lot of things wrong or risky in the things he did. But he's Obama, it doesn't matter."
"076"	"(02/11/09)"	"Drinking/kissing game in a group out of a big dirt pit we'd dug. Back in high school. This could have been with Jillian (a friend from high school)."
"077"	"(02/13/09)"	"I was prepping for a huge test. Everyone had to take it. It was like a post-college SAT. Like the GRE. I felt like I'd destroy it. Utterly conquer it. So I didn't take it seriously. Before the test, the school decided to throw a ""relax"" festivity party with football and soccer, with all you can eat buffets. I tried to play multiple games. The other guys were fast in football, but I thought I had a good chance. I began playing. I told them, just snap it to me and we'll see what happens. The snap came from a guy named Shod; fat black guy who I played basketball with in high school. It was a bad snap. I had to run to go get the ball when it went over my shoulder. They were on me faster than I thought, but I still got a lot of yards. I decided to get a hotel to stay and study the night before the test. It was instantly cut short, leaving us to wait and mill around in a cafe room with high-top tables. Nora, Shaun's girlfriend (Shaun is a friend from college who I recently visited), came on to me. I was sharing a room with her at the hotel I checked out. We were in various states of undress. I could feel the heat and slick of her wet parts. She was rubbing on me. I evidently said ""forget it"" and she was sad."
"078"	"(02/14/09)"	"I found myself at a hostel about to leave. There I met two girls, one was very small and reminded me of Stephanie Bussell (a high school acquaintance). She had the better looks, but the vivaciousness of a dolt. Then there was the other one, and ""available"" big boobed Stephanie, like the girl from a Southern state I'd met in Bangkok. She was sleeping around, I know, but when I went back to her hotel with her. Like always, there's chemistry, but I don't act on it. Instead, I go for the cold fish, She wants to play along with the orgy atmosphere of this place we're in so she accepts me when I make an advance; but she's prickly about it. When she pulls her legs back and lies down, and I put it in, she yelps, ouch ouch ouch ouch. I say forget this and sloppily touch on the drunken Stephanie. Her boops are bare and flapping. But she's too drunk to have sexual intercourse. I say forget it and go back to my hotel. She follows me. ""I like you. I wanted you to come in me and all over me. Come back. I'll let you come between my breasts,"" she says. I consider it, but don't act. I wake up."
"079"	"(02/18/09)"	"I was in the donut shop working with my father. I couldn't make the cinnamon rolls quite right. Australian customers come in. They were strange and demanding. One was pretty, the rest were dirty travelers. How did they get here anyway? The gay one was scraped up, like a scrawny dog. My father was in the back re-organizing."
"080"	"(02/19/09)"	"Reluctantly going into the national geographic store. Walking in I wondered how the whole entrance/exit procedure worked. The sales girl made a personal case of me as I looked at the tiny cameras. Why couldn't I just say, ""I don't plan on buying anything."" She followed me and vowed to herself to sell something. She held up a lens for me to sight. I had to choose from a white or green set of rotating coordinates. ""Like a pilot's coordinates"" The manager was there and said, ""we're sorry, we don't think you have serious enough skills. You wouldn't know what to do. You don't know the proper technology. What are you talking about?"
"081"	"(02/19/09)"	"I was in the city where I work prior to this, going to the movies with my brother Gerald, showing him around. Batman was showing. There were large crowds. I remember we walked past the waterfront, and had trouble finding parking on the street."
"082"	"(03/22/09)"	"On XXX Island. Woke up in the big beach house my mother was renting for me and my brothers and my sister. It was a wood-slat mansion, old, but still exuding an air of scale and imminence amid the backpacker hovels and quaint beach resorts. I was watching a movie, or that was the excuse, anyway. Really, I had witnessed a great mystery -- perhaps a window to some nascent apocalypse heralded by the arrival of gypsies and a darkening of the sky. I'd seen the runes appear, like Ankorian temples with cropped steeples, crackled with crimson veins, like river tendrils spidering down the side of a mountain, only the currents carry pulsating flows of blood. I saw the creature briefly. It was like every demoniac you'd probably seen or imagined, large, black-colored, muscle-bound and winged, only when I actually was in the presence of the fanged and brimstone-smelling thing, I couldn't help but despair beyond any rationality. Though the thing soon left, and I was left to prepare."
"083"	"(03/22/09)"	"I was late for a soccer game. It was supposed to begin at 7 p.m., and 7 p.m. was already here and past. I quickly gathered my things and ran down to my car. Cleats, shin guards, socks. I had some old shorts from my time playing with the vipers. I figured it didn't really matter much, since this was a reunion game. I got to the car and was pulling out when I realized I could probably use my rain jacket. It was raining moderately, and could pick up as I was waiting on the bench. I called up to my mother to throw it down from the window. Too much time passed, and I left without it. The rain let up anyway. I parked in a grassy field, with rows marked by sawed-in-half wooden telephone poles. I put on my shin guards and cleats and trotted to the field. I barely recognized my team because they still looked as young as they had. I only recognized Lawrence, the washed-out coach, when he called at me: ""You here to play?"" I was put in briefly, for just a few plays. I took the ball out of our defensive area and to midfield, where I crossed it to a player who eventually scored a goal, snapping the ball in from beyond the 18. I was taken out, and the game ended. I was angry that I didn't get to play more. I felt like I was at the top of my game. The coach said, ""Let's wait and see. Some players are making some good plays."" I didn't like him much. The game ended and I went off to the resort area. I was eyed by several girls, and eyed them back. Some of them were gypsy girls. I could tell a girl with a jagged bob, black and styled atop her head, with white skin and a black vest, was into me. But she wouldn't show it right off, nor would I. That was the game. But then a plainer, but still attractive gypsy with an accent, slightly off face, but still pretty, with long light brown hair, straight and pulled back, came up to the dining car that was sitting off the tracks and used as a little restaurant, ""What room are you in?"" I was skeptical at first, especially because of her strange air and her accent. I then said I am staying at a bungalow, and I don't have a room number. But I wanted to see her later. I asked what room she was in. I couldn't tell if she said ""7"" or ""78"". She had a thick accent from wherever she was. As I was about to walk out to meet this girl some more, the dark girl, putting up a pretense, said, ""I'll go with you for $10, and I'm a lot better than she is."" I responded with my rehearsed response to such propositions, albeit I with some hesitation, because really, I thought she might have been right about being better: ""Ha-ha, sorry, I don't need to pay for what I get."" I left with the accented girl and needed to return my motorcycle. I was worried that I'd lost the little rubber key. I'd just dropped the thing off. Left it. But then I realized, it would be easier to get around with a bike. I went to the long wooden shack and asked. The woman was nice. I realized it was a problem because my bike was a 1-seat only."
"084"	"(03/26/09)"	"The setting was like a space-oriented, semi-aquatic fallout (Fallout 3 was a game I had played recently). The setting was like a resort that had space docks for ships. I was the pilot of a ship. It was a saucer shape. I felt as if I could go anywhere and do anything with impunity. I could fight whatever giants or beasts I wanted. I could always escape, but I thought I could always win. A local girl, rough and tumble, came to me for help. I helped her, gave her direction, but it seemed as if she disobeyed the rules and ticked of a giant and ran to the safety of the resort village/spaceport overlooking the waters below. The giant chased her. It wasn't mean to begin with -- it just believed in honor and retribution. On the way back, she passed through an area that reminded me of the Korean airport. I was watching the scene unfold through her eyes. She was finally scared -- especially at having to risk drowning by diving under the water to evade the giant, which was as tall as the flimsy suspension footbridge strung across a gap in the karst cliffs over the water below. Later, as I was about to take off, she came to ask for help. But she decided she would go off on her own. I realized I wanted her to come with me, to work aboard my ship. She snidely commented that I should pay for a deckhand like anyone else. There was more -- involving going off in the hills in search of aid."
"085"	"(03/27/09)"	"First, I was in the city where I did my newspaper internship. There was a big festival. A carnival. The streets were packed. I left and decided to just hang out with a friend. The fireworks came. They were massive and brilliant. I was sitting with her alone in a dark outdoor place. I remember seeing the faint trail of a comet in the sky; not just a far-away check mark, but a hazy spray of particulated ice. These turned into the fireworks display; I was surprised, since most municipalities are cutting back on fireworks. I said ""I'm glad I didn't drive. If I did, I would have just walked home. I remember being across the river, near to my apartment."
"086"	"(03/27/09)"	"This dream segued into one where I was back in Thailand at someone's house. It was grandma's birthday or something, and we had to drive to the party they were having for her at a restaurant. I hoped it would be at a traditional Chinese restaurant, dim sum. But, alas, it was an outdoor banquet place set up in the parking lot of a strip mall. The tables all had red tablecloths on them. We arrived by car. My father was in the car. Like in Asia, I didn't trust his judgment but at the same time felt bad for him. A secret service agent or air force driver or something picked us up. We had connections. He was driving on the right side of the car. I remember not wanting to leave my headphones off, but I thought: it won't be too long. I was going to stay at the airport hotel that night, and quickly need to catch my flight back home in the morning. I remember being back at their house and trying to find the right bedroom to sleep in. All the bedrooms seemed occupied. Even the bathroom had a mattress placed into the bathtub. That worked, I guess.  A little ingenious use of space -- for a person who doesn't mind living out of the bathroom. It was dark and cold in the house, like grandma's house. I remember going to the other bathroom for privacy."
"087"	"(03/27/09)"	"I remember these dreams in continuity, but only relative to each other. When I think deep enough about one, it triggers associations with the ones around it. And when I remember a recent dream, I tend to remember other past dreams a lot more than usual. The dream connected to the dream with family in it was next to one where I was at a resort town in Thailand. It was packed, and I was trying to find a place to stay. The only hotels available were attached to the big mega firm in the city. It had two units. Near the main road, with the front facing a street lit up with many glowing orange lights and manicured trees, busy out front with lots of people running around and taxis and cars. The front was ornately built to resemble old Chinese palaces. I walked past, knowing the clientele of this building would be very wealthy and out of my league. Like women who wear pearls. The time frame seemed to shift. But I went to the club/bar behind the main building. It was an area I knew better. From my approach, I'd never even seen the front of that main building before until now, and I feel like I'd been here before. I met some other travelers in the bar. We conspired to just find a room with an open door and walk in. We did. It was on a top floor. I remember the elevator went up. Most of them got off on preceding floors. The numbers, glowing on the panel., went up to at least 10. I got off on 10. I went into the darkened room and remember feeling a thrill of getting away with something."
"088"	"(03/27/09)"	"It was going back to 13's childhood [a character in the TV show House] , when she was living with her dad and stepmother under the ocean. He was a marine researcher. She had a dream that her dad was holding up the dead head of one of her dwarf hamsters. This disturbed her. The wall to their apartment was underwater. It faced a reef, and there were many, many fish flying around outside. I remember thinking how the could manage such a great setup. It was dark and blue inside, with a hint of being cold and wet. She got into a fight with her father because she didn't want to live there anymore. And in the argument, she flung her hand and knocked off the top of their very maze-like habitrail tube structure. The section flew off, and when her dad picked up the pieces, he saw a dead hamster inside one of the segments. It was decapitated. He picked up its tiny severed head. It was light brown and white. I then entered the scene, feeling bad for the hamster, and picked up another dangerously hanging section of tube sticking out in the kitchen, shortened it, and put it in a less precarious position. There was a nest inside. "
"089"	"(03/28/09)"	"There was a murderer who came into my longtime friend Chris's house, and said I will kill you, but not now. When you least expect it. I couldn't sleep well on the couch. Kept feeling smothered and hot. Prickly from the down feathers coming out. I was waiting for it, wondering -- when he does try it, would I be prepared? I wanted to act and get him. But the door was locked in the front with a key, so I couldn't escape if things turned bad. He was keeping watch, making sure none of us could leave the house."
"090"	"(03/29/09)"	"I was in an office-like setting. I worked for a real estate agency like Paul Rudd in I Love You Man, the movie. There was an old, supposedly empty office building in the same complex as the functioning offices. I had gone in repeatedly, because my world had been merged with one where instant travel, dream-like strange states and weird stuff, like alternate dimensions, were the reality. I asked my boss for the task of the day. She said to go follow up on some accounts, close a deal, something like that. I had a couple numbers. I thought this should be easy. Then I went out to do this. But I needed to go inside the abandoned warehouse, which existed in its own bubble of reality. It was completely flooded at one point. The drain goes down and away to some other place in time. I didn't want to go in alone because I knew the host of that dimension, a rather scary woman who seemed like she held resentments. It was dank, old and musty like a back room of a bar I know. I'd gone in a little earlier to retrieve some of the things I'd left behind and got that very eerie vibe. Other scenes in this dream took me to an auditorium; felt like a large one on a college campus. People who I knew were there, and I think they were in on the alternate reality, but they all soon disappeared."
"091"	"(03/30/09)"	"I was essentially a James Bond type character. This dream is fragmented; parts of several jumbled together. I am driving in a car, my SUV, through our old neighborhood. I go past my longtime friend Chris's old house, or rather, what used to be his house. The neighborhood had turned into one of those horrible places in Southern California where designer abodes go up on a hillside, like little micro mansions. The greenery was nice in some houses. We passed a place where old men were gathered playing poker or something. I went around the corner, and then turned around to come back past the house. They were behind a screened front porch. Reminded me of the screened porch of the units on the street across from our house in a state I used to live in. Chris said ""I haven't seen this place in years."" I said I hadn't either. The trip was a little escape from whatever official business I was doing back at that place. I remember driving down a rural road like the one that leads to Beth's (friend with benefits) from South Avenue leading to the north side of Lake Road. We crossed cow fields and surprisingly large swathes of clean green forest and water flows and aquatic-plant choked marshes. I remember thinking how I took such things for granted, that I should have marched out and explored these things when I still lived there. I regretted that I was no longer young and would be held accountable if I did go do that because I should know the rules by now. I had to get my passport taken. I went to a place that doubled as an auto repair place -- or was it a privately owned branch of AAA? Either way, an attractive middle-age woman helped me with my picture. It was digital, through a computer. She took several pictures, each came up on the screen. A couple were pretty good. I thanked her for taking multiples for me, since my last one was so bad. ""Oh, this one is fantastic,"" she said. Like a lot of people who say I'm terribly attractive, I only half believe her. Go to the theater. They don't refund my money or something. There, I expect to run into some of the bad guys. They attack. I fight them off with moves like kicks and throwing daggers. I remember taking down the boss. Had a gun, but didn't use it. "
"092"	"(03/31/09)"	"I was driving my car away from a school camp beside a lake. It was a bit cold, but quite nice. I felt as if I had returned to high school to perform some official task, but had other reasons too, like receiving adulation for just being myself. The roads were narrow, and trees were all around. Like a certain lake I know, but with more trees and buildings. I remember a dream I had where I visited Ms. Homan's dance school up a ladder through a hole in the floor of an office building in the mountains (She was a dance and yoga teacher. I had a crush on her. For a teacher, she was flirty). Before I went to the place where the dancers were, I found myself in a room surrounded by computer equipment. And on the walls were various portraits of U.S. presidents, but with a strange bend in the history making them seem unfamiliar. I thought I was going to catch a train, but I was in some confusion about the seats. Also, I wanted to take a computer with me to plug into my car. Most of the computers were old and worn, being kept in a garage exposed to the outdoors for many years. I found a black Dell, like the kind at school, with a Pentium 4 processor. Brute strength, not finesse, as far as processors go, but it would do. I took it out of its metal-bracketed alcove, but was surprised to find that it was attached to a sort of printer/fax combo. I hated those things. They always break. Plus, there were more plugs than I would have had accommodation for. I left it behind and got in the car to leave. I was still wearing a wet suit. I'd been doing some adventurous stuff by the lake. I went to shower at the school building where the dancers were. All the old people where there from the old days, including the African American guy LJ. I thought he graduated. Was he one of those who came back to teach at his old high school? The nostalgia, I get. But actually turning your life to point back to your past irked me. There were many young dancers, and I felt good and bad at the same time for walking through the gaggle of girls with budding breasts in leotards with my red and black wetsuit rolled halfway down. Of course, I had the excuse of going to the showers. I felt like it wasn't fair, how easily I could impress them, and perhaps take advantage of their awestruck nature. The class ended, and for some reason, I had to burn some things. There was little kindling, only flammable liquid and a vat of just-fried french fries. It was out on a fenced in yard with patchy grass and a few trees near the fence. I dumped out the fries on top of whatever it was I was supposed to burn and poured on what was left of the flammable liquid. Whoever was near me and trying to help didn't do a good job and mixed the flaming liquid with water in a fry vat. It was no good. I tried to think of ways to quickly distill it. It did light on fire, but didn't come up into the conflagration that I hoped. Back in the room that I was supposed to be staying in, there was a puddle of curdling grease surrounding the bed, with a dead deer without horns in the middle, as if its fat had emanated out into the brown foamy puddle. I wondered if I could use some of this to burn as well. It didn't bother me about the mess in the room, as I thought that it would either disappear, was supposed to be there, or someone, whoever had caused it, would come in to clean it up. I didn't intend to sleep there. After all, I had a train to catch."
"093"	"(03/31/09)"	"My pet lizard was escaping from its large enclosure as it climbed too high and was attacked by a bird. She jumped, fell, and lost her tail in the process. At the same time, my dog ran out of the house and I went to get him. The door was open, and the lizard escaped. She ran into the brush. I saw her go, but figured she'd be easy to find. I put the dog back in the house and went looking for the lizard, but couldn't find her. Eventually, I gave up, but then got a hunch -- put myself in her mind -- and got my headlamp and found her under the concrete ramp leading up to the steps. Then it was a matter of catching her without hurting her. Her tail had come off, and I put it, still moving, down on the ground to morbidly push a block or something. When I went after her, her tail had mostly grown back. I tried to position myself so that she wouldn't run under the house, but she did anyway. Oh well."
"094"	"(04/03/09)"	"Dream in the tent with the mountain leprechauns or elves as the rain was pouring down. They tried to convince me that everything was ok, and I didn't need to worry and I could leave at any time. Though I knew it was not ok. They nearly convinced me. Can I leave now? Yes, of course. Just first come over here for a bit. I did that over and over. Like walking around a cylinder producing its own gravity in space. I was worried about my brother James. I didn't know where he was. I wanted to get out first and find him. The elves from the mountain were tricky, and I didn't trust them, but had no choice since I was so tired and a little worried."
"095"	"(04/04/09)"	"Dream at Nate's (a friend from high school and college) where I was in a New York style bar and the service was bad. Laura Manning was there, the girl I've never met but have drooled over since I saw her picture for the first time (we have a lot of mutual friends). She was a waitress, and we jousted over the order when she billed me for three things, expensive drinks, when I had only ordered something small. I went in and told her mean, but young and pretty, supervisor I wanted to talk to her. The supervisor looked at me, and said she wouldn't do anything, but I was allowed to talk to Laura about it. I found her, and the sexual tension pushed us to compromise. Something about me buying her skittles or something. We left together for Uncle Kong's farm. Earlier, I was in the downstairs living room of the club hill house. There were a lot of people there, and many of them were hot girls. There was one I liked in particular, and another one was attractive, but I liked her less. But of course, I only have the courage to take what I don't want, or rather, what I don't mind losing. Everyone was sleeping in the same room, in a big pile on a mattress pile on the floor. The girl I didn't like as much, but took, she was long and slender, with that translucent cafe skin that Puerto Rican girls often have. She had long straight hair, and a narrow face. Her breasts were round and firm, but not too large. I started there with my mouth. Her body arched and I went lower with my lips. I got to her lips, and before I could start on her, I realized I had to go. Shaun (a college friend) showed up and gave me a ride. His car was old. It was strange, since he acted like he had been there in the room even though he hadn't. He came on to me, and when he dropped me off at my uncle's ranch, he gave me 35 cents and said to call him. I said I had a phone already, but took the change. Kong looked thinner than usual, and he was wearing his purple bandana. I was worried about him."
"096"	"(04/04/09)"	"Reminds me of the dream where I was on the big wooden construct, about to fight the elves. Where I later sought safety by hiding by blending in with a high school prom."
"097"	"(04/05/09)"	"Dream back at home with me going to the movies, getting two tickets to a stupid new special ops themed jack black movie at consecutive times, returning a ticket, and feeling forlorn. How my mother got in trouble by owing $60,000 in garnished wages by hurting some other woman and getting a douche bag like Michael Milton to represent her and lost the case. And how I got upset. How I went home, and snuck in when someone else was living in the tall wood slat old house, and a stringy haired black girl like Savanna from high school was going inside to do something and I needed to change my clothes."
"098"	"(04/06/09)"	"I was at the awards banquet at my university with my mom, sister and my brother Charles. They decided to show up, after all. My brother Gerald was with them in the car, but he got out right away and went off somewhere. My brother James was home playing warcraft. I was glad they were there, but hadn't expected it. They got out of a minivan. We walked to the ticket area and I got my three. The old lady put up a fuss about my brother Charles, but my mother said he was a skinny 10 year old who hardly ate anything. They let him in. I said it's not my fault -- they said you could have three free tickets, and I didn't even think you were coming. We enter on the second or third floor of Weimer Hall, and I go down to the bottom floor where tables and chairs are set up. White tablecloths. The dean, Professor Foley and some experts are there at the stage. They give away a few giant plaques, framed in glass, including one where they say, you should have told us you were in honors; we messed this one up. They put in a movie during the intermission. I was still waiting for mine. It began on a stand with a school tube tv and VCR. it was something about a big conflict like Pokémon war. I was suddenly inside it, and found myself fighting these giant creatures. There was the main guy, who was camping for a high level spawn across a line of concrete rubble -- sort of a glitch. And I was there and took on a giant crab spider thing that spawned. I killed it with electricity pretty easily. But, out of its remains, two more came. They weren't terribly deadly, but their sheer size -- several stories high -- and intimidation and fear factor would be high if they attacked the city. The last part of the dream -- I was suddenly in an ammo storage area for the government. This was like a post-war area; a war had just ended, and there were a lot of munitions laying around, and dangers still out there. My job was to help store all this ammo. But later I realized how stupid it was to spend money on all these ancient bombs, most of which are older than me. I went around the shelves and picked up some of the old mortar shells on the racks. They were old and cruddy, and unless a desperate Armageddon struggle took place, nobody would use them. The place was set up near a beach with pretty green sweeping hills going away from them inland. I climbed a hill, and there I saw Darla (a coworker from the first newspaper I worked for). She had stepped into an area with many string tripwires attached to land mines. I ran up to her, and she was saying, ""it's too late."" I said no, hold on, and grabbed hold of her and waited for just the right moment. I could hear the mine ticking, and knew, because of the slack tripwire string, the mine would take a second to go off. When the ticking reached a crescendo, I grabbed her and yanked her away behind a wall, and covered her. The bomb went off, we were safe. But I could hear the ticking of some of the others. So I climbed on her and protected her. I was worried the explosions would penetrate the old brick wall. They didn't. We stood up. She was close to me. And I started kissing her. she didn't resist, but on the other hand, she wasn't exactly enthusiastic. It's like she wanted to -- I definitely felt the chemistry -- but was distracted by work. She asked, do you even know where I work? And I made a joke. She didn't find it funny. I told her it had been months since I worked at that newspaper, and the last time I saw her must have been a Sunday -- no -- a Friday, since I worked in business -- exactly 9 months ago. She said she'd meet me later and come back."
"099"	"(04/09/09)"	"I was in a place that reminded me of Southern California and Thailand. There were suburbs, and a city part of town. The suburbs were new and in neat rows with green lawns. They gave off a vibe of bourgeois pretentiousness. I was at this place where a man was in charge of the events going on. It was like a certain dive resort I know, but not a dive resort. We were all playing in the pool. It was overcast, and probably getting dark. There were animals playing with the people in the pool. I set my camera on the poolside. I left for a moment and came back. I asked the supervisor where my camera was, and he said the squirrel took it. Yes, there was a water squirrel running around. It had taken my camera to the bottom. In the empty pool, the water still and blue, I could see through to the bottom and my lumix there with the hand strap floating up. The guy said, oh no, sorry. I said no, it might be ok -- it's water resistant. But to being lightly splashed -- not completely submerged.  I dove in to grab it. Shit. As I lifted it, I could feel the pressure change inside and water leak inside. I turned it on. It started up, but went very very slowly, like car windows after a freeze. I could see the continuous, never-ending boot menu. I said damn, I should have taken out the battery first. I then took out the battery and there was water in the compartment. I set it out to dry."
"100"	"(04/09/09)"	"Inside the suburb house, I met Sue, the co-worker on the collegenewspaper I was attracted to there. Something was wrong with her, and she wasn't acting like normal. Something had happened to her, and she was no longer that eternally life-loving, sunny, bright, cheerful girl she always is. She ran away, and I went to get her. I followed her to someone else's house. It was the house of one of my relatives. She had gone there to cause trouble or something. I said I'd take her home and borrowed one of their cars. I put something in the trunk and went back to the two-story suburb house. She wasn't drunk, but it was like her inhibitions were gone. I tried to approach her and talk to her, but she was eternally flippant. Though in a flash of affection, she approached me and I took her in my arms and we went to the back bedroom and she climbed on top of me and straddled me. I looked up at her face, shrouded in those golden locks, and for a moment, I saw her as her old self. I was instantly in love again. The way she moved on me and under me was just as I expected it to be. When it was over, though, she went back to her clouded persona and her green and gold was once again gray. I wanted to stay longer, but looked and my watch and realized, oh no -- I didn't know exactly what time my flight was that day, though I thought it was at 5:45 and it was already almost 4. I hadn't even packed yet! I was driving with her and told her I had to go. I didn't want to, but at the same time it would make me look good in that I didn't look like I was perpetually longing for her. I had arrived at the first airport, got off, it was a successful flight, I think, and then had to hurry to catch my next flight, which was from the airport across town. I was angry at my father for not setting up a ride like he had told me. I left the airport in a mad hurry to the taxi stand. It looked like the taxi stand at the airport in the city where I now work. I knew it would be expensive -- wasn't the airport at least an hour outside the city? It would be expensive. Oh well, I had no choice. I was mad at myself for hanging around the airport for so long, not realizing I should have gone to my destination first at the other airport and then waited there."
"101"	"(04/12/09)"	"I dreamed that my teeth were falling out one after the other. It happened in a place that reminded me of Bangkok, only while I was there I was with Cassie (former roommate Delaney's girlfriend), Delaney and others. We had taken a golf-cart like vehicle to this closed resort. We were going to play in the ruins, but more people came and started to set up some sort of exhibit. I slid down the railing on the way down and hit hard when I landed on the balls of my feet. They were hoisting picture frames on cables, and wires had strung them all together as they were set up on the ground first. Back at the first hotel we stayed at, I was drunk and so was Delaney, a former college roommate. We were trying to find a parking spot, in addition, find another place to stay. The first place was just a friend's house, and had decor like the 1970s -- all square, with lots of brown carpet. I remember my teeth started to come out in the car. First one, just a chip, and then more started to fall. I could feel the teeth in front were loose, but I hoped it was just temporary and would go away. But it didn't. First one, then more came out. I checked in the mirror to see how bad it looked. It was pretty bad. The canine. I spat the teeth into my hand, and thought to all those movies I'd seen where people had teeth knocked out. I hoped that if I saved them, a dentist would be able to put them back. Then I worried how expensive it would be -- then wondered how all the people who had teeth knocked out in movies, even if they didn't have any money, managed to get their teeth put back in. I dropped some, but didn't know how many fell. I hoped that I'd be able to recover them all. I didn't know if I got them all."
"102"	"(04/13/09)"	"I dreamed that the end of the world was on its way. It felt like it would be of the infected zombie variety. I had a power, and so did others -- like heroes. Nobody was sure what was going to happen or what was happening, but they all had a sinking feeling -- as if it was bad, hopeless.  Many had given up hope. I still felt like I could do something. I was running through the building where my people were. It had glass sliding doors. I eventually ran to this truck yard type place, where there had also been a university science lab. Many elements and chemicals of the lab were still there. Though the mercenaries, with their giant trucks parked and idling, ready to go at a moment's notice, had taken over, I didn't fear them. I commandeered one of their big assault trucks and was confident in my power. Since I had this special power, they were by default at my service, as if the government recognized me, and hired them, and I was their commander. I went around the leftovers of the science lab with the hope of finding a solution. It was all old and done, though, with orange powders and such desiccating in what looked like fish tanks."
"103"	"(04/15/09)"	"I was getting ready to go on a trip. Or rather, I was already on a trip and about to leave somewhere else. I was sleeping in an alcove, like a platform of wooden planks laid out into a recess in a concrete plaster wall. I had my sleeping bag and other items. Collecting all your stuff is always a pain. I remember going around the place and realizing it's a prison. I wasn't a prisoner, though. There was a little kid going around giving items to some of the prisoners. One of the prisoners in a 2-person cell thought, ""I'm going to kill him."" But his cell mate was like woah woah woah . The little kid, unknowingly, dropped off the item and ran away. He could have been strangled through the bars. I thought -- he must be crazy. It's in his best interest to leave the kid alone and continue to get the stuff. Or, maybe not. He'd be seen as even more vicious and not messed with at all if he was indeed sane, but utterly selfish and unconcerned with human contact, only self-preservation. Their cell walls was covered with mineral buildup from perhaps hundreds of years of natural water seeping in. It seemed like the prison was underground, beneath a thick layer of rocks. There were divots in the solid rock floor, filled with more of the calcifying water. I went in. The prisoners seemed decent enough. And from the startled reaction of the potentially homicidal prisoner when his cellmate stopped him, he was probably genuinely crazy. Like he was in a trance. They had a pet snake. A Texas hognose, like my old pet snake as a kid. Perhaps an allegory to my lizard, as I was worried she wasn't being fed well back at home. They brought in two mice. One was small enough and white, the other was bigger, and reminded me of a gerbil -- the agouti type, with sharper claws. The mouse ran around the cage, on top of the snake, and I was worried the snake would be hurt. But eventually, the snake unhinged its jaw and began to swallow the mouse. I was impressed, but expectant, at the extreme degree the snake opened its mouth. The little white mouse was hiding in the half-pine log shelter the snake had amid the pine shaving bedding. Then the snake got the mouse mostly in. I was worried whether or not it would be able to digest such a big mouse. I wondered if I should take out the remaining mouse and re-introduce it later. But the snake took care of it when I looked away. Then it escaped. Jumped out and landed. I grabbed it and tried to put it back. But I didn't want to hurt it, as it still had mice in its gullet. I was wondering if it would try to regurgitate one of the mice, or if it even could."
"104"	"(04/16/09)"	"I was in a back yard that reminded me of my old bungalow in the city where I had my first newspaper job and perhaps some house I visited many years ago. My high school sweetheart Cindy was there. She was doing something at a table. Setting up for an event, or a craft or something. She and I were talking, and she was friendly and nice. I could see it in her eyes that she was still attracted to me. I could tell through her body language too. The fact she was acting like this, and the fact that she made no mention of the guy she was marrying, made me think something was possible. But when I started coming on to her, she said. I'm married. I said, I don't see a ring. She said, well, I'm engaged. And I said, well, who is he? My tone was condescending, with emphasis on the ""he"". She said he's an assistant something or another at Nintendo. I thought for a moment, and realized the ""assistant"" part meant he was nothing. Instead of dropping a litany of how I'm better in every way than this other person, I said: ""He'll never be Eric (meaning me)."" And she said: ""Nobody could ever be you."""
"105"	"(04/17/09)"	"I was going to meet Beth (friend with benefits). She was living in my old bungalow in the city where I had my first newspaper job. She was there with a roommate, a guy, a harmless guy, who was smoking pot in the alcove when I came in. Beth said she had to take a shower or get ready or something. I was supposed to wait outside. But, of course, I did not. I went in and smelled the pot in the alcove and could tell the guy was there, but he didn't seem to know or care. My footfalls were very silent, near the place where I kept my laundry basket filled with all the junk I had in my SUV back when I lived there. She came out and said she had some sort of menstrual bleeding problem. My first thought was, dammit. That's never fun. Then I wondered why. I asked, ""Isn't that caused from things like abortions?"" She said, ""That's not something I have to talk about"" or something to that affect. Or ""You don't get to ask that."" I wondered if it was mine, but didn't ask. Secretly, I'd be relieved, but if I had knowledge ahead of time, I'd force myself to make the hard decision and try to keep her from going through with it."
"106"	"(04/19/09)"	"And then I just ask myself how. One decade. It started when I was at a flea market on the other side of town. I was with my younger brother James. I was going through the motorcycles, looking for a cheaper way to get around. I was looking at two boxes. One was $1500, discounted. The other was $3760. The smaller, cheaper box -- I opened it. It was just pipes and stuff. Not worth it at all. There were assembled ones, but I didn't trust them. They looked abused. There were a lot of cars in the lot, too. Then I went inside the warehouse. I was going through a stack of something with my brother when I heard a riot outside. I heard screams. I heard tribal noises. Right away, I knew shit had hit the fan. This was one of those genocides. I was in a foreign country to begin with. I had been mentally preparing myself for something like this for a while. I wanted to kick open a hatch, or go out through a garage door. But my brother wanted to go out the main way. I had a very, very bad feeling. I went out, and sure enough, a little kid comes through with a switch blade. He was very young, and ultra hyperactive. He was followed by two western adults. The kids were black. I was worried I'd be maimed, not killed. I knew I could take them down, but would be injured in the process. I didn't want that. The western guy was the leader of a small band of people. I said I'd do what he wanted, whatever -- I wasn't a threat. I told my brother to stay back. Eventually, after being holed up in the warehouse -- which turned somehow into a long-haul commercial jet in feeling and in the sense we were going somewhere -- I talked to them and convinced them of intentions and in fact sort of took command. I was vulnerable because I pretended like I didn't know what was going on earlier. But when I took responsibility, I became the leader. We landed and went out. My family was with me. We had to make it all the way out across the border area to my relatives house. On the way, though ,we stopped at a family's house because a girl ran out saying there was good food inside. We saw an ipod playing a video. It was a rarity for here. I climbed an old temple thing in the alley leading to the house. I saw nicknacks from dozens of other people leaving alms.  In the market me and my brother were harassed by the local traders. I pushed them to get out of the way. Just two at first. But they followed us as we tried to steward our family through the dim market at dusk. This wasn't just the end of the world -- it was as if I'd been taken to a whole nother dimension . I was, in my head, writing a book about it. But later, my girlfriend (in the dream) would ask -- where would it be published, since I might not ever get a chance to report back to the world where I came from. I said I'd do it anyway -- for me, if anyone. We headed near a building, but I decided not to go in. ""look, a nice clean building for you."" they wanted us to go in to talk. They tried to pretend like they were our friends. But they just kept becoming more, like their family of gypsies was following ours -- trying to get close, to take what they could, perhaps rob us if we let our guard down. We were poor vagrants ourselves -- not about to give them a thing. The family went in. I stayed out. They separated us. And went after everyone else. This is when I pulled out my gun. I had them all run. I said, a 7-11 -- let's go somewhere where they wont feel safe. Or somewhere where important people will be. We headed toward the 7-11 and saw a car parked there. Inside was a soldier and his wife. He had a gun too. I told him we needed help from the crowd that had gathered around us still. He said yes at first, then said, no -- his brother was in the crowd. So I pulled my pistol and put it at them. I said, ""Ok, that's it. If you don't leave now, that's it!"" Two pulled out guns of their own. A leader, and a Collin Ferril looking guy. I just went ahead and pulled the trigger. I shot the main guy right in the head. He died. I shot Ferril, an he lingered for a moment, shot in the head as well, looking on, still conscious, in disbelief. The others then clustered in a panic. Don't forget -- the fake guns we had at the flea market; fired fast-moving, spring-loaded bullets. They were bright green and blue and red plastic. Looked like they would hurt. Picked one up to pretend to defend myself. I fired a shot into each of the bad guys heads. It was a complete gunfight. It stopped when I had sort of achieved dominance and shot all the aggressors. I had killed one girl's boyfriend. Though she saw that I had killed him only in self defense. She came to me, and I took her in. I said to her, I love you, but I killed the one you love. Go ahead. Strangle me. I won't put up a fight. She put her hands around my neck, but began to get sexual with me instead. How could I trust her? Later, she was topless, I could see her legs. They were beautiful. She was laying on my chest. There was a banquet. We had agreed to all share our food."
"107"	"(04/19/09)"	"Earlier, my sister and her friend were driving a boat. They weren't paying attention. Almost hit the wall as we went through the arch. I jumped off before it collided. had camera in pocket of swim shorts. Took the battery out, hoped it would dry. I didn't want to say I told you so about letting them drive."
"108"	"(04/19/09)"	"Later dreamed I received awards at a banquet in an Arabic-speaking country. Accidentally thought the washing machine/basin was a urinal. My mother got lost after she had to park the car. I was with my father. MacIverny (journalism professor) sat at my table. I got an award from Ms. Bailey (a high school teacher of mine I'd spoken to recently). And a mountain biking award. Just giving me small random stuff in this second round of awards. It was held in a large hall with tan sandstone bricks making up the place, like a clean massassi temple from star wars. I wondered about the expense of all the awards, and how they fit into the budget, and whether they were just valueless pat on the backs that everyone gets."
"109"	"(04/21/09)"	"I was sitting at a sidewalk cafe in a city a lot like the city where I had my first newspaper job. Someone was supposed to meet me. She was late so I ended up walking around the block. I passed kids playing basketball. Then I circled around and saw my computer stuff. I was worried someone had taken it. She met me. We went to space. I was a substitute for the mission. Before that, we sat in a bar. Debated things along with friends, other people. I'm missing the emotional significance of this dream, though. I can vaguely feel it, but I just can't say it."
"110"	"(04/23/09)"	"Forgot about a statistics class I was taking. Nina, a college friend, student newspaper photographer, was there for some reason. She was taking the class. I said, how many tests are there? She said four. I remember only taking one, and that was a hazy memory, and one was the next day. There was also, I hoped, a final. It was too late to drop. I'd simply forgotten about the class--that I had even registered for it. I went to the classroom and had trouble finding a seat. Like that dream from Spanish class, and Chinese class, where there was an impending test and I hadn't studied a thing for it. I said to my mom, who was visiting, ""I'll need to stay here -- I have a test tomorrow."" Instead of going back. I asked Anabel (Nate's wife and a friend from high school) for the key to the old apartment. She had it. I stayed there. I had two desk areas set up. One upstairs, and one downstairs -- like my old room in the club hill house."
"111"	"(04/23/09)"	"Met my longtime friend Chris for a burger at the lopsided, water-logged Denny's with Mrs. Timmons (mutual biology teacher from high school) as a waitress. The area was somewhat outdoors, or from the damp feeling of the place, exposed to the falling rain outside. Mrs. Timmons seemed to recognize us. We sat at a table in an aisle between another row of tables and a booth. I prefer to sit against a wall."
"112"	"(04/23/09)"	"Went camping with family, couldn't get the giant, illegal propane gas tank to work. Doing this in the parking area at the trailhead and bathrooms and ranger station. Tried to refill my stove, but ended up using my multi-function water bottle. The container was very long."
"113"	"(04/23/09)"	"Was supposed to meet Sue, the co-worker from the college newspaper I was attracted to, twice; both times for hikes up a mountain in a place like Paris or Brussels, on the outskirts. This may have been shortly after I met with her for coffee as I was visiting the town where I went to college. She didn't make it the first time. The second time, I saw her pull up in her car and get out with a friend. They were dressed in tutu-like clothes; for a dance concert or costume party. They were going out. I sent her multiple texts. I followed her to see if she'd blow me off or just wasn't getting the messages. I was waiting on a quiet spot on the mountain, enjoying it, but thinking how much better it would be if she were around."
"114"	"(04/27/09)"	"In Thailand, though a mix between the 1536 (the apartment I lived in while a junior in college) crowd, and a relative's house. It began with some drinking, a lot of drinking somewhere. Earlier I was watching a cartman-like character give identical gifts to people and try to infiltrate a counseling center. I went in there with a Rachel Newell-like character (a friend from high school, college, and the city where I now work). She was sitting on my lap, though there were other hot girls inside and I didn't want it to seem like she was my girlfriend because I wanted to hit on them.  My good friend Daniel and his girlfriend were in there too. They were getting relationship counseling. Inside the Thailand house, I had my minions. Slaves, basically. Like followers in Fallout 3 (a video game). I ordered them to do funny things to impress my friends. There was a chainsaw, or something scary around there."
"115"	"(04/27/09)"	"It was looking for friends. My recurring fear of missing a flight came back. I was looking for a place to stay in the resort town and every place nearby was booked up, and expensive because it was right there in the thick of things. I met Jenna (a friend I met in Asia) at this hostel she'd found part time employ at. I asked if I could stay, since she worked there. I didn't want it to seem like I was using her for the room. There was Jordan from the apartment I lived in while a junior in college and the gang hanging out somewhere -- like a Costco where they were getting some drinks. Later, a police detective came to interview me because there was a murder or something. I had nothing to do with it, and I didn't even remember much from the night before. They gave me a docket-like transcript of events the night before they'd reconstructed. I thought it would be a goldmine when I later was putting together a story about the murder. It had everyone's name and nationality flag next to it as it went down the list. Bob (friend from college) was in there, too. He didn't know much. It didn't make much sense, and I didn't remember any of it."
"116"	"(04/30/09)"	"There was the Iraqi ministry of information. It had been taken over by terrorists. I was a journalist nearby when it happened. There were people warning me outside not to go in. But I did. Apparently, this cavernous building was home to many denizens who had taken up residence inside. And now, the people who took it over, religious zealots, were roaming the hallways with knives and razorblades slicing up the people inside who didn't conform to their standards. I went in and I saw a guy, a fat, tall Arab man, like a giant dark walking potato. He had a box cutter in his hand and crossed a perpendicular hallway segment at the other end of the hall from me. He half-saw me, and I half-saw him. He stuck his head back. I happened to find scissors on the ground. I picked them up and waved them to him friendly like -- see, I'm hunting blasphemous infidels, too. He went on, then paused. He called back. I just sort of made a sound, smiled, nodded, and carried on. He then began to run down the hallway toward me. I ducked into a doorway and shut the door. It couldn't lock. Instead of running, I decided I'd try to take him out. He pushed open the door and I slashed at him. It didn't do much. He was too bulky, and the scissors didn't go in too far. He sliced me down my arm with the razor blade. I said crap, that's not going to work, and re-loaded the setting -- like it was a game -- right before he came in the door. I tried it again. And again, the guy slashed my arm. Straight down. And then I re-loaded the game again, this time, just as he started to run down the hallway. I closed the door and this time, I ran. I ran down as far as I could go. I found myself in the basement, near a place where whatever products of their operation were tossed down into. I wanted to stay away from that pit. Down here was also where they let the women shower. There was a dull-looking Arab woman in a shower stall with a shower cap on. She was getting ready to get out. She put on a towel and hurried away, like it was all her fault that I'd seen her. I was thinking -- the guy could be down here any minute. I looked around for weapons, but found none -- just janitorial supplies. I didn't think I could keep him at bay very long with a mop. I instead found a ground-floor exit. I followed it and it emptied out into a warehouse area. There were stacks of stuff on palates. And there were a few workers and other people who had merely taken up residence in this place. I was stuck. Where could I go now? There were probably guards outside, and I knew if I tried to go up, I would run into more of those slasher brown potato men. Then, just in time, the doors flung open. A squad of American soldiers came in, followed by a small band of journalists. I walked to them, and they recognized me as an American. Shit guys, they're running around with knives! I then went outside as they pushed in. I talked to the journalists. Told them I am with the Times. They were covered in blue body armor. They said that was cool. And asked why I didn't have any helmet or anything. I did feel naked compared to them. But I turned it around. I said I was inside, and just rushed out when they got there. They were impressed. When the soldiers cleared the building they said I could stay there with my team, which just arrived. It was like the fly-ins journalism trip, my photographer, Tim, was there and the graphics/photo girls Carly and Kristin. We climbed all the way to the top, to the officers' bedroom. There were plaques and trophies and all kinds of full bottles of liquor. There was also a thing on the wall that looked a lot like a trinket with my college's emblem on it. Such trinkets are everywhere. The room was plush, and I was looking for a place to sleep that night. Couch, or carpet, it was all plush."
"117"	"(05/01/09)"	"I got 50 kills in CoD4 and the match sent a message to everyone saying I'd be right back. I teleported away to a bonus level. In the game, I was in a sniper battle with this guy wearing blue body armor. After I shot and killed him -- it took four shots from behind with a sniper rifle, and one in the field -- they interviewed him. How do you feel about Cannondale (my in-game nickname)? He's all right; I've got nothing against him. Never played with him before. And then they released dogs, which attacked more like fast attack bears. I climbed on a fence and shot down at them. I didn't think they were much of a threat. One came in close and I shot at it, and ran in circles and kept it from pouncing on me. There was a creepy old house set out in the middle of nowhere. It had no doors, only high windows that were sealed tight and small. Strange things began to happen. Like I was transported inside, with just the few items I had. Though one of my items was a .357 magnum revolver. I had fired one shell outside as a large attack dog came at me. I hit it, and its injury showed up on a camera attached to its collar. There was like a witch inside operating the whole operation. I saw her replay of the incident. The dog wasn't dead, but my shot, which entered below its neck and went through its shoulder, caused it to scurry away and stare.  Inside I tried to check my gun. I opened it and dumped out the shells. Uh oh. Half of them were corroded, falling apart or filled with dirt. The witch. I figured they might still work. They wouldn't be nearly as powerful or shoot as far, but they'd still bark out a mist of junk that would injure or disorient or scare an opponent. I had a hard time separating the dirt from the powder. I put them back into the gun and hoped for the best. I saw my allies, outside and looking for me. I thought they were transported inside. So I wasn't looking for them. They were looking for me."
"118"	"(05/08/09)"	"I was in a house. There was competition between me and someone else over possession of something. It was reminiscent of my grandparents' house, though from decades ago, when the place was alive and verdant, with jasmine vines hanging over the water of the pond. I was trying to take a shower in private. There were friends and allies around. I wanted to keep them safe, even though they didn't know they needed protecting. Then the person came. He was familiar, like a brother, but ultimately adversarial. He was like an arch-nemesis, the kind of enemy you hate so much, you cannot kill each other. At first he is trying to get inside. I lock him out of one entrance, and sprint around the side of the house and then upstairs and outside. I run along the top of a concrete wall, then to the roof. I can tell he is coming for me, but will take some time. I get in position for when he rounds the corner. He comes around and I knock him down. He drops something, whatever it is that was being protected. I make my move and jump from the roof for it. I think, ""why the hell not,"" and leap from the roof and escalate the conflict. My robe flutters through the air as I land near the thing. I defied gravity as I leapt so far and broadly and landed so lightly. I used the energy of my impact to leap off again, spiraling upward through the air. My enemy, clad in red and dark blue robes, came after me. He could fly too. We battled in the air, in an acrobatic display of aerial combat like the matrix or dragon ball z. There was water in much of the flooded area. I leap and grab him, and take him down hard. I wrap my arm around his neck and make sure his head hits the bottom after we plunge through the water. Without sound, he tells me: ok, you win. I know he's not really dead, but that I have simply beaten him."
"119"	"(05/15/09)"	"I was a new recruit in a military training program. It was in a different time, with different expectations. A more pure time where there is less gray in the world. But it was a tough system. This was the program for the best of the best, and I was new -- uninitiated to the ways and tactics of these people. They trained through simulations; combat games. This was my first test. They had a young, head-strong cadet before all the rest in the hangar, standing on a sort of metal pad. The captain called me up. Said I would be a part of this exercise. He told me in confidence not to worry, that I would be o.k. Though when I saw the scenario, I felt a sinking feeling. I was to defend a shantytown just inland from a shipyard. I had only a few units, all of them beat-up and out of position. The enemy would have a fleet at his disposal, and enough marines to saturate my men 10 times over. How was this fair? The game began, and I wasted no time. I sprinted out of the hangar and looked to my right, out over the harbor. I could see the massive tangle of warships pulled up nearly to the concrete pier. I sprinted away even harbor. Since my units were out of position, I couldn't even contact them. I didn't even know where they were. They'd be mowed over -- they were mowed over -- before I even knew how many I had. I turned right around a length of chain-link, barbed-wire fence. There an intelligence agent briefly approached me. He handed me a riddle. It was something I needed to find. He told me, ""it will be ok."" I read the puzzle, hidden on a strip inside a plastic egg. It made no sense. I didn't have the time to put it together! They were coming! I decided I really didn't have any other options but to go with it. So I slowed to a jog, and read it again. Ok, maybe. I ran up the main road and turned down a side street in the city of plywood and corrugated steel panels. There was an area set aside, like a secret power facility. I climbed in through a hole in the fence. I pulled a panel, hit a switch, and there appeared this red gelatinous material. I knew I had to take it. But I didn't know what it did. I grabbed it and ran away as fast as I could. Right when the enemy force was about to take the city in record time, they were forced to stop -- the secret operative radioed to me: do you know what the ___ _____ can do? No, but neither did they. Could it be used as a weapon? What was it? I didn't know. All I knew is that the enemy couldn't roll in completely without first getting their hands on it. I had an idea. If I could stay hidden long enough for the scenario time to run out, I would win -- that is when reinforcements would arrive. The problem -- it would be an entire day. Well, I would do it. My strategy wasn't quite running, and it wasn't quite hiding. I would stay in the shadows of a building, and when I would hear an enemy soldier approaching, I would sprint off. They had a steady grid. Unless I slipped past it, they would find me. I was faster than they were. I remember thinking that if I did hide and I was discovered, there would be no escape from those little shanty houses. Several times I found myself caught in the open by some of them, but they couldn't kill me outright. Their orders were to capture me. So when they closed, I sprinted away, right from their grasp. This continued on, and even spilled into the rich, lush, new center city. Though it was off limits -- and I was warned not to get too close or I would be reset. Dream ended after nightfall, as I had gone on long enough to know that I would not be stopped."
"120"	"(05/18/09)"	"Running from the bears down the mountainside toward the beach. I had just escaped one place and was headed toward the next. I needed to warn them of the invasion. Scrambled down the mountainside. It was straight down. I wondered if the two big bears could follow me. This was an amazing place. I wish there were more like it and I had time to explore. I jumped from rock to rock, letting gravity pull me as I jumped and tumbled. I arrived at the beach town. I stumbled in, ragged and torn, and went to the lifeguard station. I said to the girl, I need aid. She said, What do you need? I said I am exhausted and dehydrated. The others sat around and giggled like girls do. I liked her. ""Guys like what they can't have. No. Me. I know that I always want what I can't have."" I said it boldly. And then delivered a speech to get them to believe me the invasion was coming. They came and I simply grabbed her by the hand and ran. We needed to cross inland. We were trapped by the sea. I saw a bridge and had us run for it. The first one was blocked already. We needed to go further up the coast. We did, and we found an open bridge. She was getting tired. I told her to run, just run. This is it. It was donning on me as well -- this escape could be for all the marbles. I ran with her across the bridge, and it looked clear. The landscape was like the beach pine cones on an island I am familiar with. But, no! There was a second causeway leading across the marshy part. Units were taking up positions there. A person who lived there was looking on in shock. Should we go up this strip of land more? No. The road would be occupied already. I told her, we need to turn back. But... back across the long bridge we had crossed, there were two soldiers taking up position. There was no way out. But down. It was a long, long way. I didn't even know how deep it was. I assumed it would be deep enough in the channel in the middle. I told her. Look down there. Jump. Stay under as long as you can and swim for the shadows along the edge. I knew we would be sitting ducks bobbing up at the middle. She was afraid, but I knew she'd jump after me. My feet hit the water first. And down I went. I could feel my body torpedoing through the water. And Even though my eyes were closed, I could feel the bottom rushing toward me. I curled on my side and let my shoulder hit the bottom. It was gravely. I landed softly enough. I opened my eyes under water and everything was crystal clear. I could see the sun shining above me. I saw the bridge pilings in the distance. And I saw her legs kicking near the surface. She was going to give us away. I swam as deep as I could and held my breath. I was waiting to see the air trails of bullets hitting the water. None came. Those idiots might have not even seen us -- or figured we'd just committed suicide. Just as well. There were more bridges further in the distance. I had it in my mind that we would go and just keep on going until we could go no more. The adrenaline coursing through my body made all suffering and hardship seem like just something else that had to be done. We came out into a drainage canal that lead into a tunnel inside a treatment plant of some sort. It didn't look like we were followed, or that anyone was here. There were valves and gauges. We came out a door on the other side and it was night. This place was a sort of industrial area. There were lots of old corrugated steel panels and fences, lots of cast-off plywood. But as soon as we stepped out and closed the heavy door behind us, I could hear footsteps coming from inside. I poised myself to tackle whatever came through. It was a large man wearing a ghastly Halloween mask. He had a knife in one hand, like a kitchen knife, and a big wrench in the other. I grappled with him. He was slow, and not as strong as he looked. I wrestled away the wrench and hit him over the head with it. He bent over. I hit him again and again until he was motionless on the ground. But as I was wrestling him down, I yelled to the girl. Help me! She screamed back: how! Bite him, do anything! She did nothing. I took the knife out of his hand and stabbed him through his ribs a few times for good measure. We left and continued to sneak. I kept the knife. She didn't sneak very well. She didn't stay down well either. She made too much noise. That's when the cadre of bad guys -- four of them, all high level, came around the corner and took her. One looked like grand moff Tarkin. I was forced to flee. I followed them and walked into their commandeered house like I owned the place and was about to kick them out. I saw a table full of interrogation tools, and her dirty panties on the metal tray. I got angry then. What they'd done to her. I walked into the bathroom and saw her naked laying with the old Tarkin. I saw a potato peeler on the counter, picked it up, and in a fluid motion, knelt down and jammed the thing in the sleeping Tarkin's throat. I twisted it. He was dead. Then came a knock at the door. It was the others. The hallway was narrow, so only one could be at the door at a time. I opened it and a younger one was there. I hit him with the potato peeler on his chest. He had a knife, and I took it. I stabbed at him a few times and he fell back."
"121"	"(05/18/09)"	"Playing Call of Duty, a Search and Destroy match. I am the last one standing. I kill what should be the last enemy, bringing my team victory. But there is a glitch. More and more appear. I kill one, then another, and rush with the bomb to the pile under a tarp I am to destroy. I keep hitting the plant bomb button, which is resting on my crotch, and think, this is an awkward place to keep a detonator. I keep hitting the blue x button but nothing happens. Then an ally shows up. Then behind me an enemy puts a knife to my throat. I know it's over. I say, do me a favor, and shoot me in the head instead of that knife. She says, ""Is this how you people do it?"" or something like that. She put the gun to my head. I move it back a little to get everything -- I didn't want to inadvertently just cut my optic nerves. I say do it. She does it. I knew I would just respawn. I woke up in a boat being towed by bad guys. I was tied up. There were others with me. One man fell out and was being dragged in the water by the boat. We each had an individual rope attaching us to the boat. We were in a sort of dinghy. He fell in. I tried to help him. I fell in. It wasn't so bad."
"122"	"(05/20/09)"	"I am the vice president of Jamaica. The mayor/president of the place is nice enough. He gave me the position when I met him in the customs hall. This Jamaica is smaller than the real one, like Andros in the Bahamas. I'm there on a family vacation. I am fighting with my mother. I hurry ahead to go exchange some cash into the coins they use before she does something stupid like trying to pay for things in dollars. Something is wrong with the guy's counting machine. A coup erupts. I'm left with money that looks like play dough and no way to change it back. Anarchy is in the streets, and I know I need to find some place safe to be -- since I was named the president. I go through the downtown place where there's a merry go round. It's turned into a central place where the revolutionaries shout through their megaphones propaganda. I tell my family to follow me and stay close. I'm worried my mother will say something stupid to the black gangs now roving the streets. I tell them just to keep walking, even though they are hassled."
"123"	"(05/20/09)"	"Skiing on a lake covered in algae; Chuck's (my water ski instructor) lake, but years overgrown and un-maintained. I remember fearing the alligators. There were so many alligators there now. They hadn't been kept under control. I was glad to get back up to the dock and on the little cliff looking down into the lake."
"124"	"(05/20/09)"	"The knife fight with the blacks in the store as I was gathering supplies. It was a like a turf war. I was charged with defending our headquarters but nobody seemed to be organizing, just wandering around like they didn't know what to do. They wouldn't listen to me. As a refugee group was moving, according to un-logical orders from someone else, I started shooting the people in the face. All in the line. But the gun, an mp5, broke. The bullets just drizzled out. I pulled a clip from the vest I stole off the guy I shot in the face with the weak gun that was on the ground. Tyrol (the character from Battlestar Galactica) tried to dissuade me. Getting supplies at the store -- vitamin water and cans and in a backpack. Running around trying to do everything before time ran out. The city was vast, but I had a vague idea of how it was laid out."
"125"	"(05/21/09)"	"Lesbian sex in the back seat while on a mission for a government agency assault team. I was in the parking garage. We were searching the parking lot for enemies. Inside one car, I see a woman curled up asleep, as if hiding. The others see that I see her, and say good luck. I open the door and climb in. I know what I want to do, but something is wrong with it. Instead, my character becomes a woman -- so it won't be as bad. I lay down next to her; she looks at me, and is attracted. She puts up only token, playful resistance. Then I revert back to myself. We are naked, and I have just ejaculated all over her face. I am still hard, and I begin to fondle her and say I want more. She says you can do this to me, and I just might like it. She takes my dick and balls into her mouth. I am about to cum again. I then start fondling her again and then put it in. She started to have second thoughts and said, my mom's here. I was like what? She then touched her heart, like she's thinking about what her mom will think. I then put it in. And then I woke up..."
"126"	"(05/21/09)"	"Battlestar galactica. Jumping in the ships. Trying to find safe harbor. Internal discord. Everything was falling apart - literally, figuratively."
"127"	"(05/21/09)"	"Driving around Thailand. Going to the bad end of the town. I meet a tall girl from my university alma mater and her mom. I'd met them randomly and offered to help. They're meeting me on the other side of the river. I was going to go first and check it out. Only way to get across is by floating/fording. The man had a black dog that brought people over with a small bark log raft. He swam it to us on the dock. We had to go one at a time. I wasn't sure it was safe, but went with it. I was wearing my white American apparel shirt, black shorts, and had my gear in a waterproof bag. I jumped in the water no problem. Halfway across, a ferryman took over from the dog and quickly rammed the thing through the water with a pole. We arrived at the dock and talked money. I thought he wanted 300 for each. I said, yeah, right. Then I said 25. He explained how that would leave him with nothing. Again, I thought he was talking individually. I gave him two 50s -- though they looked counterfeit that I got from Cambodia. He didn't seem to mind. I waited for the others to come back across, but they went to the gift shop to get clothes that could get wet. Across here was ""The New World"", owned by a big guy who was the boss of all these people. A female warrior chick on the other side explained to me how he wasn't a bad guy, but had issues. How he married a woman for money, divorced her, and invested everything in this operation. He didn't like what she had -- money. "
"128"	"(05/21/09)"	"Deep sea fishing, getting hooked, being horrified that I was reborn with a defect. I reeled in a giant sea bass. I still wanted to throw it back, even though it was huge. It wasn't a record, and it wasn't a fighting game fish like a marlin. The George Bush critique  play that was supposed to be therapy for my time at war. It's not therapy for me to merely do it. I need to let everyone else know. The problem with the girl dropping stuff all over the racetrack and causing an accident by the car sucking in the ball bearings."
"129"	"(05/26/09)"	"I'm on the run with Cameron and Sarah Connor (characters from Terminator). We're in a beat-up old truck. Though Sarah turns against me. Or at least wants me to go along with a plan I don't agree with. I decide to dash away from them. I don't have any weapon, so they know I probably can't get far. I find a big tree and climb up into the crook of its branches. It is filled with leaves and ferns and dirt and dead branches. I say to myself, if you want to survive, you need to go all-out. And so I bury myself up to my chest in the detritus."
"130"	"(05/26/09)"	"I'm at a baseball game. I'm playing in it, or at least trying to play. I have access to the underground parts of the stadium, the back ways. I feel like I'm late for something. There are multiple fields, like in Little League, though the whole thing feels professional. I wonder if it's a place where I'm supposed to be. I've never been too good at playing baseball, though I try to look what I'm doing."
"131"	"(05/27/09)"	"Attending a graduation ceremony. It's an extra one, like the one my university alma mater asked me to attend and sit on stage, but that I couldn't make. I was in the city where the newspaper I now work for is located and had to fly down and take that Thursday off. Supposedly someone told me I wouldn't miss work, but really, I would. And since I didn't book a return ticket, I was worried that I'd need to get back on to airline web site and book a flight and because it was the day before I needed to be back, it would be expensive. I felt bad for my parents. They didn't have the money to pay for a flight, but they gave it to me anyway because they wanted me to come down for graduation. So I did. The graduates all rode to the site together in this open-top double-decker bus. We were supposed to jump up and cheer when we passed the parents. Did it again when we passed the faculty. Along the side of the road there were people getting drunk who had just graduated. They graduated us in cohorts. They cheered us along as we went along the road, which was lined with trees. We arrived and got out. It was like a parking area in a certain restaurant. My bike was there. I'd left it, apparently. It didn't have the tire on the rim. I rode it and stopped behind a white station wagon. I thought it was my parents. No, they didn't ride in that anymore. I looked and found the green van. I left my bike there and asked them to bring it home."
"132"	"(05/27/09)"	"I walked toward campus along university avenue and went into a bar. It looked like one of those dive places with poorly painted walls where hipsters hang out. It was crowded. I sat at the bar and ordered a burger. Just give me your regular burger. The bartender gave me a shot of something pink to boot. There was no barstool. I was balancing on the ledge of something under the bar. The girls next to me were drunk and stacking the chairs. The person to my right was passing out and I kept nudging him away. The bar phone rang. It was Nick, my old college roommate. Hey man, you're there and not visiting us? I was hungry. I left and there was this Kaplan (LSAT prep) guy talking. I asked how many points our score would increase. He had a beard. ""I took the test f-five times. And let's say I scored... quite high."" he said."
"133"	"(05/27/09)"	"I found myself being pursued by Maria Brigman (a girl who liked me but I didn't feel like liking back). She was in bed with me naked. Though she seemed hesitant. She got off from being with me, then squirmed when I put my fingers in her. She got up and said she didn't want to because we weren't married."
"134"	"(05/27/09)"	"I was on a scavenger hunt with Stephanie (a friend from college who now does PR work in the city where I now work). It was us hanging out, though we were in competition with each other. She got into a big semi truck. After the first couple items on the list, I realized it would take days to finish all the stuff. I didn't want to spend so long doing this. She drove away slowly toward another list item with the truck. I tried to catch up to her on a little beat up bmx bike I found. She rounded a corner into traffic just as I had caught up. Oh well. I was on a hill near a beach area. I helped a woman with something. She had a kid with her, but she was still attractive, although a few years older than me. She thanked me profusely. And said, You know, son stay here, I need to show this man something. She was going to take me to a back room and give me a blow job, I was certain. I told her no, no really, it's ok. People can do nice things and you should just accept it. Really? Ok , thank you. She looked longingly, though. I saw this and said to her, and yes, you're checking to see if what you said excited me, and it did. She smiled as I turned away and left."
"135"	"(06/12/09)"	"I was a teminator. I lept from the cliff onto the pine trees below after fleeing from the shoe store with the glow-print eating nerd hipster idiots. One tried on a hat in this abandoned store. They were roaming around earlier, looking for food and other items in the fields like cattle. Irradiated patches of wheat and mushrooms. As I was running away from the guarded main road, I came across a band of them. I ran with them as the other terminators came after me. In the store, the idiots put in a DVD and messed around with the phones, which they didn't know how to use. They probably didn't get killed because they were idiots. Later I went out and tried to escape in a truck that had been there fueling for months, with the nozzle still in the gas tank. The truck and other vehicles were soon ripped apart by the other terminators -- which were more looming and massive than I'd seen before. I tried to run down the road. They followed. I ducked into the brush alongside the road. I had a feeling that I could not escape, no matter which way I ran or how far.  Dream went into a transition, as I was a bare skeleton without skin; it had all gotten peeled off as I fell from the cliff and into the pine trees. I had run and jumped off a cliff and got skinned on the way down. I wanted to get into a stasis to heal. I was just an exposed skeleton with chunks of flesh attached, even my spine. But it was all heavy, articulated metal. I arrived at the bank of a lake or river near a school. This whole town was playing baseball by the river; it was on the edge of the city. The old mayor man had a beard like Santa and tiny spectacles."
"136"	"(06/12/09)"	"I got inside and it turns into a movie theater; my high school sweetheart Cindy is there with her fiancée. She looks different. She stands next to me and puts my leg between hers. We talk as she stands like this and her boyfriend looks on. We left. He was trying to be nice, but overtones of asshole were there. We walked into the lobby. I saw my longtime friend Chris. We chest-bumped, but he fell down. Maxine (a girl who lived next door during high school) was there. She had bought my old jeep for $200. They were all on my side, turning against the new guy. We went to the parking lot to see the car."
"137"	"(06/12/09)"	"I'd gone to jail. It was unfair. They wanted to keep me in. They didn't tell me anything. It was as if my old house during my young teens had become a cell. Justin, a friend from college, had been talking about his jail experience a few days before. The woman was your typical dumb black city cop, just ""following procedure"" and not thinking for herself for even a minute. He attitude was ""I'm authority, and you needed to respect it for its own sake."" I was planning my escape, right over the top of her if I had to. I felt the whole system was beneath me and stupid and they had no right to hold me. I began to walk out, and climbed a fence. It felt like one flew over the cuckoo's nest. "
"138"	"(06/18/09)"	"A stripper/lapdancer wrapped herself around me in a hug. She was divorcing her husband. She smelled the same as the lapdancer I had been with at a club that evening. This was happening as I was in the pr office tending to supposedly Jackson's (a friend who works at a magazine) injury -- he cut off his heel somehow and you could see the bone. I was going to treat it with antibacterial ointment and gauze before I got him to the hospital. I was made the right hand man of the agency. The other girls working there seemed to accept the decision even though I was new. It re-affirmed my view that in media situations, people look to me for advice. I was pleased that they trusted me. The head of the agency was gay, and I felt like I could bring a masculine swagger to the company's aura."
"139"	"(06/23/09)"	"This dream took place partially in the loft-like area of an apartment building. It was like in the city where I now work, but surrounded by what seemed like a rural ranch-like setting. Like a summer camp. It had something to do with work. Like for a story. I tried to log on to Facebook, via my laptop or someone else's , but I found the files came out all strange and coded. At first I thought that it was an error, but when more people started to see the same problem, it became apparent that there was a virus -- and I had accidentally uploaded it somehow. Or at least I was used by someone else to help upload the virus. I went to the top of the building, and inside the space, I found the culprit. This setting was part of some organization from an earlier part of the dream that I can't remember well. I helped fix the problem, and was rewarded by being given a new laptop. It was an alienware . Very different than anything I'd get on my own. It was giant, though I could watch it from essentially across the room. And the speakers were loud. I went back to my apartment, which was a little like my real one, especially during the rainy evening hours when the light is gray and dim, and I went to sleep watching it. Though there were roommates around making me uncomfortable. I was excited about something, which was why I had a hard time drifting off."
"140"	"(06/24/09)"	"Can't remember much. Just that I remember writing a story and trying to get the real name for one of the dissident state senators. He changed it to that name from something else. The setting was official, and the source seemed trustworthy. But I was skeptical, as always."
"141"	"(06/24/09)"	"I was in the house we lived in during my young teens, or a place like it, and we were all locked in and scared. It was raining out, and my god, there were zombies everywhere. Society was still functional, but we weren't sure where they would be next. I knew I had to go out somewhere to get supplies, but nobody was sure what money was worth anymore. Food was scarce. I was also reporting on a story. There were other people in the compound. My family was there. I was more worried about them -- protecting them, keeping them healthy and safe. I remember looking out the back sliding glass door and thinking it was not secure, and could easily break. The view from the 2nd story deck was better, and the suburbs all around looked gray and dead. The roads would be hazardous. The public was scared and irrational and self-centered. I didn't want to deal with them, but knew I had to for the story and to get supplies."
"142"	"(06/28/09)"	"She was wearing a red dress. Blonde. A porn star or actress. I was leaving a downstairs office and she was saying goodbye. I was going to, or wanted to, meet her later. She said she had a scene. What kind? Probably hard core. I lied and told her I wanted to hear about it. She was just getting out of makeup. Room 6, floor something or the other. The building was made from brown bricks, like the college campus in the town where I went to high school. It was square, built around an open courtyard. I opened the door and saw her in a salon chair in front of a mirror getting done up by a stylist."
"143"	"(06/28/09)"	"I went back to the arts center in my high school. A new black theater teacher was running 12th night. I was dressed in costume. I had to prove that I was a former student several times over. I remember standing near the stage, unsure of what my role or lines would be this time. I was frustrated with the lack of direction she was giving, and the procedural rigmarole of her letting me into the theater. I was visiting a family on the water front. it was a nice place. They'd taken to me, even though I barely knew them."
"144"	"(07/05/09)"	"Dreamed that I was in the newsroom of the newspaper where I now work, near my desk. I was facing the wall, however. And I was stressing working on a series of stories. Professor Betsy Childers came up and said I had cashed an $80 check in her name, and wanted to check up on it. I logged into my computer and checked my bank account. Jeff Harr and Bob Traux (former editors) came over and chatted. Jeff asked me to pull up my list of stories. There was a long list. I thought that it wasn't quantity that mattered, but Jeff seemed to think so. He was impressed, however. I was on a research boat or something like it along this deep part of the Amazon. I wanted to get a canoe with a friend to go down and help with the water lettus cleanup, but really, just wanted to venture out away from the camp -- which was like a swamp-like version of my desk. My place in the swamp eventually turned into my work area at the newspaper where I now work. I was writing that story, and there were pictures of nude girls in a long row in the file leading down. They were part inspiration, part topic for the story. Emily (intern who I'd made out with and was flirting with) was IMing me via google chat."
"145"	"(07/05/09)"	"Later things changed into a warehouse/factory setting. There were peopling hanging around milling about. Caity Norton (an artist who I knew from home who went to an art school near where I now work) was there for some reason. I asked her to consult with me about a web site thing I was doing. She was sidling up like that drunk blonde chick from the train the night before. It had to do with me trying to write a story about a massive train station that people had turned into a picnic area. The only light came from long banks of far-away florescent lights, and everything was rusty. The picnic tables, the ground, even the walls and ceiling. The whole cavernous place reminded me of a rusty manhole cover with calcified drippings all over it. The place was shaped like a hangar, and the floor was pebbled and wet (almost like bumpy terrazzo). In the dim distance there were chunky steel grates blocking passages leading to god knows where. Caity comes in as I'm sitting at a round stone table trying to post my story to the newspaper's Web site. I'm having trouble, and she sits down and offers advice. I don't know if it worked or not, because I woke up."
"146"	"(07/09/09)"	"My mother called and said my brother Gerald had a sudden heart attack. I thought that was surprising, as he is 21 and healthy and active. I thought at first it wasn't as bad as she made it out to be, since she tends to blow things out of proportion. I went home -- a long way, but compressed for me in time -- and met them at the hospital. The doctors were hesitant to come out. I knew then that trouble was in the air. A rage, worry and panic took over. And I could not let what they were suggesting happen. I tore through the hallway and pushed open the double doors to the bay. There were many beds in a row, curtains around them, and very dim in the light. At the end of the room, there were several people wearing scrubs and masks around a hospital bed set against the wall horizontally. Gerald was there, and he was laying still. I ran over and started yelling at him. Dammit, Gerald, wake the hell up. Come on. You're better than this. I put my hand on his head. He had long hair like he had when we were kids. I tousled his hair. Then he began to stir. He turned over.  I could see the blood-stained spot on his hospital gown where the doctors had performed surgery. He turned over. I thought that wasn't good for him. He was thrashing and rolling around. But at least he was no longer flat lined and gray. Get up, Gerald. Then I woke up. "
"147"	"(07/10/09)"	"What began as a trip to a vacation type place, like a big group trip to a bungalow near the beach or woods, turned into a somewhat stressful social interaction. There was that pressure to hook up. But the girl in graphics at the newspaper where I work came on to me. She basically undressed in front of me and wanted me to take her. She was inexperienced, but very willing. At first we were in a tucked away corner outside the building. Near a stone path through the grass and trees, perhaps just beyond the rise leading to the beach. I lay down on top of her and remember her parts were very taut and supple. All of them. I kissed down her body, but when I got to her leg, it seemed like she had some surgery to her bones to make them longer, as if she were insecure and wanted to be taller. I kissed part of the leg, and then wanted to spit, as if the bone graft had come off in my mouth. I overlooked this and we went back to a room. Here I teased her with my dick, feeling on her with my hands and mouth. She was very small in my arms. I was so turned on by being able to completely wrap around her. I put my dick in her, but didn't press on too much. I didn't want to finish too soon. I wanted to relish in her petite freshness. She sprang up and straddled me and I was standing up. I lay her on the floor, and as I pressed deeper, we scooted down the hallway, me pressing in her on her back. She was yelling for more, deeper, harder. I obliged until she came. Then when I tried to double down and cum myself, I woke up."
"148"	"(07/12/09)"	"Water park. Friends went off; place was like an amusement park. Chantalle (a friend I sleep with from time to time) was there. I was reporting on a story. I was struggling to get all the information I needed. I was surprised I was so far in. Trying to write this all from the field. It had 7 sections. I was struggling to finish the last section. I needed a quote."
"149"	"(07/12/09)"	"I was in a bar. There were portraits on the wall of award winning dogs and their families. My family was the most recent, and my dog was smiling in the middle. I was much younger. I looked like I did in high school, with long hair. It was an award for the Pulitzer for best dog."
"150"	"(07/13/09)"	"Traveling at night in a rickety boat. It's like a square, like a floating house. There are provisions, but the whole contraption, with an attached dinghy used to keep the horse, feels like it could collapse or be swallowed by the choppy sea at any moment. Where we're going, I don't exactly know -- but it feels like a necessary adventure. I didn't know my traveling companions well, but they were friendly and we had similar goals."
"151"	"(07/13/09)"	"Shipwrecked or stranded on a far-away island; much like the undiscovered islands of Hawaii or Thailand. There were vast beaches with white sand, backed up to craggy mountains covered in thick forest. It's daytime, but overcast. There were dozens of people stranded with me; they all struck me as followers, going with popular opinions. They wanted to stay and wait for rescue. But the captain of the boat who brought us over, along with a few others, decided it would be worth a shot to venture out, try to hobble to safety on the boat, which was listing in the water (and there was a horse they needed to bring with them). The only engine was one of those multi-purpose tractor engines they use in Asia that had to be hauled back aboard and attached. As the boat was beginning to take off, I jumped aboard and grabbed onto it. It sunk right away, diving down like a submarine. I thought this was a maneuver that the captain had planned, or had happened, and the captain decided to go with. The boat plunged down into the shallow bay, flipped, then pointed upward toward the surface. I was holding onto the pointed bow like a trainer at sea world on the snout of an orca. It launched toward the surface and we were suddenly away from the surface, but lost in a way. I knew it would not be wise to stay on the island -- it had plenty of wildlife, but I did not think there was enough fresh water and food to sustain such a large population for very long."
"152"	"(07/13/09)"	"The captain and the two others with us, lost and low on fuel, pulled into a vast swamp. It was a settlement, or used to be. He had known it as a port in years past, but hadn't come back in a long while. The way he came upon it was suspect -- I wasn't sure if he had actually been to this place before, or had simply heard of it, and traveled toward it based on where he guessed we were in the ocean. Or, he had simply ventured away from our stranded location with no destination in mind, and found this place by accident, only recognizing it from lore. Regardless, it was not what anyone wanted or expected. The row of buildings were still standing, but since they were made from wood, they were rotten inside and out. While the shell of wooden slats, almost black from decay, stood in the rough shape of multi-story dwellings, upon closer examination, it appeared that they would crumble if I touched any of them -- like the guts of a dead animal spills out when its tissue-thin carcass is disturbed. I get the feeling that the people who once inhabited this place suffered the same fate as the buildings. We were able to pull the boat, which looked more weathered than before, right up to the squishy bank where the houses stood. I was surprised they were built on land at all. The swamp was thick and impenetrable in every direction. It was closing in. However, there was a dog, like a Chihuahua, running around. I wondered how it got there, and how low on supplies we were -- I was willing to catch and kill it for food. But we let it go. The horse was eating from the foliage around. I was glad it was eating -- it would be difficult to keep it healthy any longer at sea. Hints that a horrible disease killed the people came into my mind."
"153"	"(07/13/09)"	"We found ourselves captured by natives. Or captured, and we had just escaped. It was in a swampy area near the shore. We were pushed up against the water. Me and perhaps two others. They were coming out of the forest all around as we were on the shore, which was covered with seaweed, leaves and sticks over the sand, all of it heavily matted, like on the edge of a mangrove thicket. My first impulse was to stand and fight. But the captain said watch out -- they had poison darts! Indeed, the darts were flying. He picked one up off the ground and showed me. There were perhaps hundreds of darts flying from the thicket toward us. They all missed. If I was hit, I didn't notice. I couldn't see the shooters, but I knew they were there, just beyond the tree line. I picked up a long, hollow bamboo reed, and picked up one of the darts from the ground, loaded it through the spongy back cover of the bamboo, and fired it back in the direction of the attackers. It hit him, and he reacted in disbelief. He emerged from the brush and fired back at me. I didn't know how long it would take for the poison to take hold, or if it had been washed off when it stuck into the ground before I picked it up.  I dodged multiple darts. Then another warrior came out of the brush, this time with a spear. I ran at him, from the side, and wrestled his spear away and turned it on him. With this weapon, I attacked perhaps two more who came from the trees, stabbing and slashing. They went away and we were ok, for the time being. I looked at my fellows with a sort of, I told you so -- we could fight them off, see?"
"154"	"(07/13/09)"	"Wound up back on that first island. Things have digressed into chaos. This might have happened before the other things; I don't remember. There were people trying to take control. And there may have been foreign people, with much better technology, trying to take control of the island also. There were teams. My team was few in number, and not prepared. We didn't even know there would be such conflict. I made the best of the situation and acquired several weapons by theft or force from the other side. I wanted to resolve this without violence. My guns -- an assault rifle, sub machine gun, laser pistol and a .50 cal barrel -- looked intimidating. But I knew they were all very low on ammo. I had to use them to maximum effect. I told the bad guys, led by a witch like woman in a torn black dress and long black hair, that they should all back down -- I had firepower and could use it. I flashed the assault rifle, which shot laser type beams. She said she wasn't afraid and her people moved in. I said ok , that's it. I pulled out the big sniper rifle and began firing at them. I wanted to save the more affective assault rifle for when I might actually need it. I was hoping the much bigger and louder .50 cal sniper rifle would scare them off. It didn't. The bullets, white tracers showing the trajectory, zoomed all around them, under arms, between legs, over shoulders, as they ran toward me. They never did close, and I seemed to be getting away -- but then, from high above, more much more accurate shots rang out from a ledge high above. It was one of the more advanced people raining down bullets. I got out of the way and took cover behind a rock. There I found one of their advanced wet suits, which were the color of pink coral. I didn't know how it worked, but kept it for later. I tried to fire back with my pistol, but it was too inaccurate. I didn't know how to calibrate the scope on the big sniper rifle."
"155"	"(07/13/09)"	"I had decided just to take it easy, as I had all the supplies I would need to paddle a kayak back to the mainland when the weather was right. I looked out into the distance, and saw the shadows of the scary swampland in the foreground, and in the distance, the faint shadow of safer large island or mainland. I was resting in a hammock on the beach inside a shack. It was nice out. I wanted to read my book. Then I got a call on a radio from my brother, who was out at sea and coming in -- he needed help, and was thirsty. He had a native guide with him. The two them were in a raft floundering in the surf. I didn't want to go out and waste my supplies. I filled up an empty Gatorade bottle with tap water. I was surprised there was tap water here. I threw it out to them. Then the surf brought them in on their own. He is always getting into situations like that, where he is underprepared and I have the right supplies. I look at my green kayak and mentally prepare myself for the trip back away from this island."
"156"	"(07/14/09)"	"Just a few fleeting images: I'm downtown, in what seems like the hip area of the city where I now live. I am looking for a place to eat dinner. There is a Japanese restaurant, and it's serving Sapporo on tap. I like it, but I am not sure my friends will like it. It's on the corner of an open street. There is an overarching plot, but I do not remember it."
"157"	"(07/14/09)"	"I am changing in a stall, like the open kind at some beaches. There is a local girl outside; the kind of ""regular"" person I associate with being a local. Not college educated, works a low-level service job, like retail at a big box store or waitress. She starts talking to me over the top of the stall. I am here working on something, a story for the newspaper. We hit it off well talking. She has curly brunette hair, and is attractive. She is wearing jean shorts. She comes into the stall and we press against each other. We begin to kiss and undress."
"158"	"(07/15/09)"	"About being in the office. Some Asian-Americans visiting there. being in the shack (police bureau) that doubles as a bedroom. I fall asleep when I'm supposed to be on the job. I get dressed wearing shorts. Javier (co-worker) comes in as I had just gotten ready. Checking my voicemails. Jake (a friend who lives in another state) leaves me a rambling nonsense message. There are conference rooms. Supposed to be covering something at a park but the event is scrubbed because they are afraid of graffiti -- what's the point then of the event if they are afraid? a trash boat throwing away pumpkins into the grinder. flames come out. molten metal shoots out to where I was standing behind a pole. fire hose."
"159"	"(07/16/09)"	"I was writing a story. Though the atmosphere was very informal. I started out working from the shack in the police station I cover, then found myself in the sixth avenue office. I was calling and calling the police to get more information, but the assholes wouldn't reveal anything. From a witness of the incident, I got shady details. There was a tour bus. There was an accident. Nazi KKK members were involved. It had the makings of a good story. The injured man was a fat Hispanic family man on vacation with his wife. I tried to talk to him, but his English was bad and I couldn't understand. I didn't know if he was talking in Spanish or Portuguese. Back in the office, I was trying to work, but several co-workers were more interested in going out after and making other plans for the day. I was working with Jenny Kee on the story. Matt and Kelly and Matt's girlfriend were off trying to do something in a meeting room, one of the ones with the glass walls, so I could kind of see inside. I didn't want to get involved. I was writing in a part of the office that reminded me of my bedroom. Simon, my editor, was working on a computer from the window sill. He was able to sit on the whole thing and work from a laptop. A co-worker came in and asked him something, but she annoyed him, so he snapped at her with a sexist comment. Dean, another editor, came in and said, ""Cut that out or you'll come with on the six minute walk."" I figured that meant a trip to HR. Journalists despise HR. I despise HR."
"160"	"(07/17/09)"	"Coming down from the roof of a hotel with new friends, and an acquaintance I didn't know very well and didn't much care for. Reminded me of that too-wired guy James Ginty. Creepy. Not very trustworthy. He wanted to take us to another party.  The city was dark. It was night time, but barely so. Either very early in the night, or very late. We were near the corner of two streets, my neighborhood. I didn't want to go off with this group of people. I was tired, and didn't want to deal with their idiotic drama."
"161"	"(07/17/09)"	"I was in the lobby of what seemed like the police station I cover, with the turnstiles and security check-in counter. I was waiting in line, like at the post office. Take a number and wait your turn. Though the people there seemed to all know each other, and I was new to it all. They were part of an almost cult-like summer job program. I didn't care much because I felt I was above the program, that they were likely getting scammed. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and believed all the great things they had to say, if only so I could get in and find out the truth. I was let past the turnstile to see the program's bearded director, who reminded me of the deputy commissioner of the police department. He said I could go ahead and join the program, if only for a few days a week, if I wanted. I said sure, why not."
"162"	"(07/17/09)"	"It was night time, and I was on the south bank of river in the city where I work. It was much more forested than in real life, and narrower. It was like it had been 200 years ago. One of the little islands in the river beckoned. I had to retrieve something from there, or perhaps go as part of this job program/cult. I think it was the latter. I found a canoe, a very small one, and began to paddle over. The going was easy, and faster than I expected.. I had with me a friend, reminded me of another guy I once knew. Coming up to the heavy foliage on the bank of the island reminded me of pulling up to the bank of the island in the middle of the lake back in the town where I went to school when I was 10 to 15. We dodged branches, and when the bow of the canoe made landfall, I got out and wondered how I could secure it without a rope. I figured it would be fine, resting on the bank. The friend was skeptical of where we were going. We went uphill through these woods along the ridge in the middle of the island. There was a long log house, but with a modern interior that had new refrigerators and computers. It had screen doors. I went inside. There were many young people milling about doing something that resembled work of some kind, but I failed to see the purpose. They were adversarial toward me, as I was an outsider.  I told them I had permission to be a part of the program. Apparently they were about to move the program somewhere, and I needed to go to the new location, in a nearby city, if I was to be a part of it. They didn't tell me how to get there, but I followed one of them into a secret underground tunnel that led to the other side of the river and the suburban city, like in the nearby resort town, where the new operation was based. It had gray concrete walls and pipes, like the cellar or sewer level of a big building. The light was dim. There was a young woman wearing a tight white knit shirt or sweater toward the middle of the tunnel. She didn't see or hear me. She was doing something with items on a shelf against the wall, partially behind a support column. I knew she would try to keep me from passing through. She reminded me of Nicole, the girl who was over at my apartment the night before. Very fancy girl, with that sorority girl way of talking, but with a very regional tinge to her voice. I snuck up behind her and had a metal rod in my hand -- about the size of a large screwdriver -- for protection. I found it in the tunnel. The tunnel had all sorts of industrial type items like this on shelves. I walked up behind her and told her ""hello."" She grabbed a razor blade -- a rectangular razor blade, without a handle -- from a shelf in front of her and swiveled toward me. I didn't know how serious she was, so I grabbed her hand holding the razor. I made a threat with the rod, but she didn't seem to care or correctly called my bluff that I wasn't really going to hit her. I instead tried to get the razor from her hand and talk to her. I thought she was attractive, and felt as if her assault may have been her way of flirting. I saw myself coming across as happy go lucky and nonchalant to her utter seriousness. I was afraid she would bend her fingers to cut my hand with the razor, since I only had her by the wrist. She eventually backed off and lowered the razor. She wanted to know where I was going. I told her. She was skeptical. And we walked out of the tunnel, each eyeing each other skeptically, as if one of us could attack. I wasn't going to, but I was afraid she would. I didn't know why she saw me as a threat."
"163"	"(07/18/09)"	"There was a threat of a widespread world disaster; it would hit one time, and then we would see what would happen. Chances are, many would survive. It was not going to be the end of the world--so long as we were prepared.  I thought the threat was overblown. I was riding my bike up and down these very green streets; they reminded me of a cross between parts of a nearby city and the town where I went to high school. There was a lake from that town that I passed, but it seemed older and less maintained . The swan pens were nowhere to be seen. I knew I had ridden too far. I was going to the apartment of a friend who had a basement that would make a good bomb shelter. I turned around and pedaled back up the street. they were bumpy. made of brick; both Williamsburg and the downtown where I went to high school have that characteristic. I came upon the house, and went inside. It was very much like my own apartment. And there was a roommate there. Not my actual roommate, but Javier, a friend from work who was assigned to the same police station with me this week. He was trying to sleep in his own bed, but I was more interested in getting things ready, or at least cleaning up. The place was sort of a mess. There was a big plasma tv and it was tilted onto its side over the entertainment center."
"164"	"(07/18/09)"	"I wanted to go out and watch TV or play a game by myself, so I went outside and took the TV and a blanket with me. The place was on the edge of a park. It was very much like a park in the city where I work. benches. many people out, even in the evening. There were trees and grass. I took everything into the park. But it started to rain. It was raining for real that night, and I got caught in the downpour. I left the TV , but grabbed my blanket and ran back inside. I was in my boxers, which is why I brought the blanket and sheet to cover up and keep warm. I hoped nobody would steal the TV. I went back inside."
"165"	"(07/18/09)"	"As I was leaving my building, Sandy (a girl I met in another country who developed an unhealthy obsession) came in. She didn't see me. I was walking across the other side of the lobby. I was wearing sunglasses. I saw her come in and go to the counter, as if she had found where I live and was trying to surprise me and was asking if I lived in this building to the doorman. Instead of meeting her, I went out the revolving door. It was sunny outside. I felt bad, so I waited for her to come out. I was leaning against the building. She came out and walked passed me. I said, ""Sandy."" she turned around and acted surprised. I didn't want to see her, but I felt bad she came all this way to see me. This reminds me of the same feeling I have not looking forward to going out with this girl who asked me out the other night."
"166"	"(07/18/09)"	"I was out trying to get to a Democrats' meeting. I got a tip from my editor that it was not far -- but I had to hurry. It was a Saturday , and I had just woken up. I was not fully prepared and had not done my background research, so I headed out. I wondered if it was where the meeting had been in the past. I was near the upper west side, just north of downtown, near a big museum and art center. I looked around. I came to a college that had a campus within the city. One of those small city colleges. There was a map. It had numbered buildings. It didn't help. I called the Democrats. The person on the other line said, ""oh, it's not important this time."" I got angry. ""Look, you can't do that."" he told me where it was -- there were indeed two locations, and this one was across town. I hurried away. I thought about taking public transportation, but figured it would be faster to walk. I started turning around the iron rails leading down, but turned away. I wanted to look at a map. "
"167"	"(07/20/09)"	"I'm on a boat. It's a luxury cruise liner set to go off. But before it can do that, it's stopped by the catastrophe that has taken over the planet. A greater cataclysm inspires zombies to appear. The ship then pulls into a river. It is an island, stocked with food, and very well heeled guests expecting only a short jaunt out for a premier or something. They argue over what they're supposed to do. I'm onboard for some reason, though I don't feel a part of the crowd. How I wander this ship and don't care that I'm not allowed access to the front. I go anyway. I lean off and I see them, brown and listless. They weren't moving or attacking right off the bat."
"168"	"(07/20/09)"	"Vampire. Stuck inside with faulty Internet or computer network. Dragons. Assembling the savior device -- the little robot that downloaded into the big computer system and secretly grabbed parts as it went. Like an r2d2. Waiting for the event. The bad guys had already captured our dragons. They were waiting to die. I was one of our assets, which I thought was sad, since I wasn't battle tested."
"169"	"(07/21/09)"	"Walking around an area like a big square in the city with friends from work, including Simon. He was headed the other direction, trying to network with someone, who was heading elsewhere. He joined our group when he passed us."
"170"	"(07/21/09)"	"Trying to find someone in the woods with an infrared scope through the trees in a game like paintball. I had a partner and felt like I could win. I got one bad guy, and found another, but couldn't ID him because the campfire he started in front of him was obscuring my equipment. I couldn't recognize his heat signature."
"171"	"(07/24/09)"	"My compatriots mess up the log contraption as we're trying to make it through the swampy part of the Indian-made booby trapped path because if you step on a grave, bad things happen. We fall in, but nothing horrible happens. They took apart the trampoline type thing. In a bistro outside the city where I work. Covered. People are taking down and selling signs. I see a main thoroughfare, and then Main Street and Center Street. I live between them. Playing soccer with these kids. They're smart allecky. I score two goals. Starts off as I leave my apartment and walk past a half-soccer field set up as part of a campus behind my building. There are two Mexicans and Arabs playing there."
"172"	"(07/24/09)"	"I'm trying to get high. I think I do. Inside a place where several friends are staying. Like a hostel. I wait for a girl to get out of the bath. Another female friend helps her because we want to use the shower. She tries to do yoga."
"173"	"(07/24/09)"	"I'm riding on public transportation. I don't have a place to stay. I ride the train all the way down to the ferry. I need to shower. There is a shower on the public transport, but no light. I try to use it while moving, but it's hard. I want to watch the news and get something to drink. I walk around in a place that reminds me of Spain or somewhere out in a suburb of the city and I find a bodega with chairs on the sidewalk."
"174"	"(07/26/09)"	"I'm an architect living with my single mom, who's like Nancy from Weeds (a TV show). I meet a girl. Her mom is a spy. We hit it off immediately. We are in my house. It's a large house. I'm writing a story about the agency. That's how I meet her. She's young. Still in school. She rides in a car with me. We have sex in the hallway of a building as we're leaving. She starts it. It begins as a generic apartment building but turns into a house. Nancy comes out with a gun when the spy mom sneaks in to case the place and find out who I am. I watch her like in a movie as she snoops around my messy bedroom and closet and tries to discern things about me."
"175"	"(07/29/09)"	"There is a causeway made from gray bricks leading across a body of water. I can't see far off the edges. It is perhaps foggy. There is fauna on the banks along this causeway. The banks are muddy and there are a few trees. But it's not the most pleasant kind. There are many snakes. I am curious by them, but there are so many, it's unnerving, especially with so many under just one tree that I fell down underneath. I got up quickly, in case any were poisonous. One of them caught my eye. I couldn't believe it, because it looked like a blue-clouded python. There is no such thing as a clouded python, but there are clouded boas and clouded leopards, both exceedingly rare. The point was, I found a bluish snake that I knew was rare and a good find. I was worried the python would eat the lizards I had collected, which were lined up near the end of the causeway. Someone knocked them over and they all went running away."
"176"	"(07/29/09)"	"I am at a house I haven't been to before, but am working. There is an old professor of mine there, or an old man with some clout in my life. He is influential. He asks for my help to get away from this place. I help him out. He gives me a guidebook. I ask him how he manages his condition. He has a medical condition of some kind. He shows me a bag of weed. I laugh."
"177"	"(07/31/09)"	"I was in a part of a nearby city with a train yard and some bodegas and run down houses. I was there scouting for a movie that I was writing. The project was uncertain at first, but later I got a preview of a press release from Columbia Pictures with my name on it announcing the upcoming film, which I hadn't even written in full yet. This bothered me. There were movie industry people all around me telling me it would be fine and I shouldn't worry about the deadlines. I took their word for it, but was still worrying I wouldn't be able to turn out a good enough product in time. They had script doctors, though, I'm sure. But I didn't want them. I could get it right. This was my first movie. I got onto a bus that would take me to a new location. It was night when I got off. Chantalle (a friend I sleep with from time to time) was there. I hadn't seen her in a while. People were sitting inside drinking. It felt like a bar I know on a vacation island. It had that gritty sweet smell, like fried conch fritters and honey dressing. I went over to her and we began talking. She wrapped her arm around my neck. We went to a more private area, like a couch in the dark yard at night, and we began kissing. I remember my hand on her bare thigh. She was wearing a dress. Her skin was so soft and white. I went down on her, and she began moaning. Then, suddenly, she got up and said I can't do this with you. She ran off to her car. I didn't know why."
"178"	"(07/31/09)"	"I was in a valley filled with pine, between massive sweeping snow-capped mountains. There was a trail that led across the basin around the lake in the middle. I had a camera. There were animals that were unafraid. A red raccoon came nearby, and I began to photograph it in detail."
"179"	"(08/03/09)"	"I am working out of a place that reminds me of the EU parliament in Brussels or the area around the UN in New York. It's international and political, with all the intrigue and maneuvering and people with political capital and agendas milling about. They are gathered for a big event of some kind. I am there covering it in some capacity for the newspaper where I now work. There are several other reporters and news sources there, though I feel like I have a better grasp of the undercurrent of real stuff going on. The official line isn't what it seems. There is a summit of some kind. But also a bad plot. A very bad plot, and I feel I am being perhaps manipulated to further an end I don't know about. There are steps lining the side of a cliff, sort of like the park overlooking the UN. But much more elaborate. Made of wood, the queue at a themed Disney ride or something, with rope rails. People are lined up for their turn at something, or to be let into an event at an auditorium nearby. I cut through to get to the front. I am told to give something to someone. It is Manny Paquiao, the boxer, who is a delegate from the Philippines and a material witness in something important. It's an international bomb plot that was being planned. Outside a British ministry, where they have vast stores of underground bombs, a bomber set something off not long ago and the bomb went through the building and into the ground and set off all the explosives, causing massive damage. They were now trying to find the cause of that and keeping another similar event from happening. I felt I had to work harder, since my competition, fellow reporter Simon, who is British, inherently knew more than I did at the beginning. I felt I may have been indirectly responsible for the upcoming disaster, then realized they were just trying to keep me quiet because I had learned a terrible secret--two siblings, the product of incest, were separated from each other at birth and sent to live in foster homes -- but years later, they somehow met and got together, furthering the cycle. They were in political positions and this couldn't be revealed. Someone claimed they had video of me giving Paquiao medication that led to his heart attack. I started watching from afar as a Daniel Craig James Bond character began pursuing the real bad guys. There was action, like in bad action movies, from helicopters. Craig pulled up to a place on an ATV in full body armor, put a bullet proof vest to hang over each hand, had a gun in each hand, and walked into a warehouse and began shooting so nonchalantly."
"180"	"(08/04/09)"	"I then stopped watching the movie type thing and came back into my character. I was walking through the inside of this house that was supposed to be an after-hours hangout for the media and political elite of the place. A place to network. I remember there were pictures from past events on the walls around the balcony of the multi-story townhouse (with carpet--I thought there should have been nicer wood floors); they showed men mixing with models, and there were also those career type young women in the bunch. I wondered if they resented the models, and if the models, wearing bright lipstick and tight clothes, resented the businesswomen, since they likely represented polar opposites of feminism. I came downstairs and talked to Andy Lewis, who was a pr flak who was on my side. I talked to him about a story idea I had that I wanted to pursue. Andy was a journalism friend from college who had a pr-ish nature about him. I then started talking to Kelly Newman, one of the young copy editors at the newspaper where I now work, who I get along with well and respect, about how we both agree that the stuff on this corporate structure handout being sent around is total bullshit. ""I hate it when they create a bureaucracy that is supposed to approximate real life, but fails, and then they expect real life to conform to their bureaucracy."""
"181"	"(08/04/09)"	"I got the bill for my computer repair. They charged me $500 + a $75 fee without telling me. I was going to fight them. They said ""likely"" water damage. And I got pissed because they had no way to prove it."
"182"	"(08/05/09)"	"I was inside the building of the newspaper where I now work, though it was vastly different. It's as if the newspaper tower and the television complex nearby had merged. There were the transparent glass stairs like in the Apple store and in much of the newspaper building architecture inside, though the building was much more sprawling, low and disorganized. There was a convention going on inside. Melinda, a managing editor, was the host for the speakers coming up to the lectern to give brief speeches. My name was somehow on the list. I did not expect this. But I ran up anyway, just as my time was about to expire. I gave a brief, but heartfelt speech. Some people made sounds of agreement to what I was saying (I forget exactly what I said). I left and went down the circular steps to this basement level--a part of the newspaper's building I haven't been to before. It was lined with light hardwoods and glass and a lot of natural light still, typical renzo piano design. A girl came down the hallway. She worked here, though I hadn't seen her before. We paused and looked at each other then passed each other by."
"183"	"(08/05/09)"	"There were two girls walking behind me. They were talking about me. It didn't register, though one thought I had overheard. She came up to me. She said I'm sorry for my friend. She's like that. Though she was hitting on me too. I said I didn't mind, and asked them how things were going. The taller one (first girl to talk) asked if that happened to me a lot. A little embarrassed, I said, yeah, this is the third time this week. We kept walking and made small talk."
"184"	"(08/06/09)"	"An epic road trip following the plot to a movie. My friend Cassie accused me of losing her camera gear after I had in fact found Kirsten's on the beach and rescued it. She was just upset at herself. This was in a resort town, near the beach. Though the layout reminded me of another beach town.  There were water guns. Getting the jones dr pepper soda. Changing clothes. Fighting with the Russians. Being told I have five days to produce an epic story... and if I do, I get the investigative reporter job. Pitched to me by Karin in the newsroom. The water guns. Talking to the guy native in the resort town. Going into these kids' house for the night. Mostly girls. They like me and we tell them stories of our adventure. My companion is either my brother or a close friend."
"185"	"(08/07/09)"	"I was in the back yard of a house near the rural forest area in Vermont or something like it. My family is there. We are on vacation; I find an old Thompson World War II gun in the house. We hear all kinds of noises in the back yard. I climb up into a wood fort that was built to see what the commotion was. Turns out, the woods were thick with animals. At first there were just raccoons. Many of them milling around. I hate raccoons. I took a shot at one. The gun, an automatic, was fairly inaccurate. I fired in bursts that made the muzzle climb. The raccoons ran off, but came back. Eventually, the animals grew bigger and more dangerous. Two black bears tried to enter the neighbor's house. I didn't want to shoot the house so I didn't shoot at them. Then there was a huge shape, like a big old wolf. It was stalking up the hill. It was big enough to be scary. My brother James and my sister were in the fort with me. I told them to stand away from the entrances. There were two, located to one side of the thing that was built like a tree house. It's good the entrances were near each other, I thought, because it would be easier to defend. My siblings picked up 2x4s and held them en garde toward the open doors. I fired shot after shot and the wolf ran away. Then there was a puma or panther climbing on a nearby roof. It was also big enough to be deadly. I fired. It ran away also. I wasn't sure if I had hit anything. The gun felt sort of weak. Then two more bears appeared in the water below. They were swimming after fish. My brother Gerald appeared, and started to reach in after them. I told him to stop, not only because the bears were big and dangerous, but because if they attacked him, they would have to be killed by the park rangers. I like bears and I didn't want to see them hurt. I shoot in the water to make them go away. They ran away under the dock. I wondered where they all sleep during the day, since there are so many in such a small area and few places to hide. A giant freshwater stingray appears in the water. To test the gun, I fire one shot at its large, un-missable shape floating in the shallows, and it starts bleeding. I check. I have 18 shots left. I then see the neighbors in the nearby house across a big field searching their own property. I want to say hello and introduce myself as the new neighbor, since everyone else would have been too shy, I climbed down and began to walk over. Then, in the open field, a black bear appears. There may have also been a lion, but it ran away. In the middle of the field, it got closer. I yelled at my brothers and my sister to climb up into the neighbors raised fort platform. They don't see the danger. I stand my ground in the field to keep the bear back. It is all black but has a white tuft on the top of its head. It begins to charge. I shoot. They seem to have no effect. I wait for it to get closer. I measure my ammo. I shot again. Nothing. Then, knowing I only have one burst left, I wait until it is almost on top of me, then pull the trigger. I aim for its face. I see its teeth and tongue hanging out. It crumples before me, looking small and weak suddenly. I see another, smaller, bear and worry now that I am out of ammo. But I realize it is the cub of the bear I had just killed. I was sad. I thought it might be best just to kill it. But I had no ammo. It wouldn't survive in the wild on its own. I raised the butt of the rifle to kill it (the Thompson had turned into a shotgun - one I had bought, or was thinking of buying, in the dream before this one that's hazier). Then my mother showed up and the bear ran to her. It climbed up and she held it. She said she'd take care of it. I went over and petted the little bear. I said Ok, but just know it will never be able to go back into the wild and will need to live in a special facility. I dragged the bear carcass over to the neighbor's back porch. They were rednecks. They had guns themselves. They seemed welcoming enough. There was the wife, the husband and at least one kid. I told them I killed this bear. I wondered if they had a scale. They didn't answer immediately. I thought it was silly to drag a dead animal with you when meeting someone for the first time. But I suppose that was common here. I put the bear on a bathroom scale they had out. It came in at 90 pounds. I thought it was much bigger. It was bigger when it was running at me. I was disappointed. Then the husband gave me a hanging scale. I hung it up onto the garage door track. And put the hook into the bear's mouth to hoist it. Same or similar weight, though the thing was hard to use. It had all kinds of temp readings on it, and a radio tuner for some reason. Later I was walking down the street to get out of town and drive back home. I then started driving. There was so much traffic. I didn't want to get caught up in any of the traffic. So I decided to get out and wait it out. I got out and started walking. A girl got out of a bus. She was driving. She was young and pretty, with long, straight dirty blonde hair. She asked if I was Eric. She had heard things. Good things. I was a growing legend around there. She asked if it was true I was a world-class diver. I said, well, maybe not world class. But I did kill a bear. I thought to myself, next, it's going to grow into I killed a bear with my bare hands. She said she had to go off and tell her friend she met me."
"186"	"(08/08/09)"	"Dreamed I was on top of a hill. There were ancient gothic type buildings built into it, or something that felt that way. There was an antagonist. He was chasing me. I felt like I could always dodge him or it, but he kept trying to get at me. There was some sort of strange social circle surrounding this; it was part of like a co-op. I was there only temporarily. It was going to come to an end soon -- or I was leaving -- and I was trying to get people together to have a party. The rooms were open, like gazebos, and made from wood."
"187"	"(08/09/09)"	"Working like mad. I need to finish a story. It's about a pretty twisted guy involved in voodoo or something like that who was caught, and I have exclusive material. It can be an amazing story. Though my deadline is coming up, and I didn't have nearly enough already written. The nut graf. I can never get the nut graf in time. But when I do, it's so easy. I had just minutes to go. And the story was all in pieces. My editor, was starting to call. I didn't want to check my e-mail. I knew questions would be stacking up. Javier, a co-worker, came over and offered me some advice. It was good I took it. He's a good guy. "
"188"	"(08/09/09)"	"I was in a rainy city. I was inside a high building floor. There were some strange people there. Antagonists. They tried to jab me with a needle full of something to make me pass out so they could I don't know what. The makeup of the group was two ugly girls and their chubby gay cohorts. They jabbed me with the needle as I was resting in one of the rooms. I threw them away and I ran. I didn't know what they were trying to do that for or why. I fought my way passed them and felt the drugs beginning to take effect. I made it outside, like a rainy section of old part of the town where I work, with everything gray and the streets more isolated, with grassy planters and bridges and road archways. I got away. "
"189"	"(08/09/09)"	"I was driving around the town where I went to high school. It was night. Late night. I was trying to find a place to write. I was going through my notes on my computer, and as I scrolled, the road moved with me. The car moved in reverse along the street. I had a hard time steering with one hand and writing. Then, like video, the world changed and began playing forward in real scenes places I have been that I had supposedly written about, like full motion video. And I could interact. Copy editor Emily Sherbourne was there. It was mildly antagonistic. We tease each other. We were doing that then in a flirty way. Before I began driving, I was in a building that was supposed to be the newspaper building where I work, but much less transparent. It was solid. The elevator opened up and Emily came in. We chatted. Then the doors opened again and it was the actress Cameron Diaz. She said to call her Cam. This was surprising. We rode down and made small talk. "
"190"	"(08/09/09)"	"I found myself climbing out of a reef. It was almost built into a building, half outside. I had fallen asleep under water with scuba gear on as I was watching the fish and coral. I woke up and gently rested on some live coral. I was afraid I would hurt it and that it could sting me. Then I realized how long I had been under water and climbed out. My hands and feet were very wrinkled. I'd stayed in too long. "
"191"	"(08/09/09)"	"After driving around the town where I went to high school, I pulled into the Starbucks parking lot to find a place to write. It was near the beverage castle near a neighborhood by the gray-blue painted strip mall. The Starbucks there was new. It was open until 10:30 p.m. I tried to find a parking space. A Porsche had snuck in and taken one. I backed out and just found another one. A girl from high school I knew but didn't want to talk to was pulling out in an old pickup truck. She was one of those who tried, but has a shitty career and would do nothing but whine about it and then I'd feel bad talking about ""everything I'd been up to"". I went in and a girl started talking to me as I was leaving after she stepped on my foot. Sorry, she said. Then she glanced back. Are you here for the fundraiser? A fundraiser-looking cosmetics sales thing was going on inside the Starbucks with a joint area, like those combo taco bells/kfcs. No, I'm a reporter, I said. I work for a newspaper. She was impressed and acted like she knew me. I went outside and then somebody's mom from high school came up and started talking to me. Though I didn't remember her and had forgotten her name. She was a hot mom, however. She then started to pitch her charity/fundraiser. I listened along to be polite and pretended to be curious. "
"192"	"(08/09/09)"	"I was sleeping on an air mattress in my friend Stephanie's apartment. It deflated. So I inflated it. I was worried that it was too full. I sat on it. It wasn't. I went out to take a shower. I was worried Stephanie and Mark would be awake. I didn't want to go walking through their apartment too early in my underwear and disturb their day. It had slept in -- it was 11:30 a.m. already. Nobody was awake. I was in luck. "
