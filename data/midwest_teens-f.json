    "description": "These dreams from teenagers (ages 14-18) were collected by students at a suburban Midwestern high school in early 1998. The students did their own analyses, then sent the dreams to us. They used our Most Recent Dream method to collect the dreams.  These dreams have not been analyzed by us yet; they are of possible use for age and gender comparisons, and for attempts to find conceptual metaphors in teenage dreams."
