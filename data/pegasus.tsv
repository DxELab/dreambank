"0001"	"(07/10/49)"	"I saw a lot of sparrows playing in the dust on the ground. I shot a couple of bb's at them as they walked and some were as large as quail. I sneaked up on them and caught a baby and an old one in my hand."
"0002"	"(07/10/49)"	"I was shaking hands with someone. I went to confession. Then I went again and we walked by twos up steps to the priest who was sitting at the top of the steps."
"0003"	"(07/11/49)"	"We were at a bazaar and I was buying by twos. Bobby was doing stunts up above on a bar or something. Brownie said a horse in the fifth race. He showed me it. Madeline, he said that was his neighbor's horse and a fast runner. I called in a junk man to collect up all the junk. I was eating bananas. They were mostly spoiled and Grandma's had some fresh ones. The lights wouldn't go on by Grandma's in PA. I finally got one to light, but the cord was smoking."
"0004"	"(07/12/49)"	"There was a lot of mud around. I held a little baby in my arms. I was above the house and it was quite high. I bought some land like a farm. Earnest Dolpin and I were walking to work. I had a locker near the window and a chair to sit on. I looked out the windows and saw a colored man lying on his back and talking to a white man. He had a hard-on and I said he is doing that purposely so the white girls can see him from the windows and go out with him."
"0005"	"(07/13/49)"	"I was to bet a bundle on two horses in a race. I was at a race track and was going to play a horse. I played one and he won. I don't remember his name. I was getting the track ready for a lady. There were padlocks on a steel rope, but I pulled them off. I had money to bet. I put some eggs in my pocket and they broke and ran down my leg and out of the bottom of my pants. I took pants off. I went to a gambling place with George in a tough neighborhood. I took my wallet out of my pocket and put the money into watch pocket. We went in, one of the guys saw me put the money there. He reached for it and I said no. I said, ""I got 3 kids and just bought a house."" One tough guy came up and I slugged him. I punched him and he bounced back. Then they ganged around me so I fled. They gave chase, but I flew up and they got into a car. I flew over a river into some woods and hid in tall weeds. I saw them coming. I went into a building and there was another superman. We went together. With a disguise. It was raining. We saw one of the kids. We ducked him and got into a building and that was a trap. The roof was low and the doors were locked. I couldn't fly high. They had two lions for me. I was afraid, but I couldn't get away so I grabbed one of the lions by the mouth and whipped his body on the floor. I cleaned him up so they got a large dog to get me. He was easier than the dog. I went into the next room and the gang was there. I cornered them. Now they were afraid of me. There were dice games and card."
"0006"	"(07/14/49)"	"I saw a sign on a window (Paddleduck Duck) 5c. Then I saw a drake jump on a duck and tried to intimate."
"0007"	"(07/15/49)"	"A man brought out a small wildcat. He let it out and it ran around in a large circle. He said, ""You better run if you hit him and don't kill him."" I threw a rock and hit him. He fell over and was a black pigeon. He started to move and then flew up. I thought he was going to chase us, but he took off and another pigeon flew after him. They disappeared. I saw two other pigeons flying by. I picked up another rock and threw it at them. I hit one and down he came. He was knocked out for a while, then came to. I told Ann, ""Boy am I good today."" I walked up to the pigeon and he was on his feet. He flew up and away."
"0008"	"(07/15/49)"	"We bought a large old house. The trap under the sink upstairs was leaking and the water came down over the downstairs window. I said, ""I will have to fix that up."" I didn't like the house. Neither did Ann. The kids played outside. Then we found them outside. A tenant was washing the window on the 3rd floor. We yelled at her to be careful and not fall. I saw a lot of scorpions in boxes beside the house. Ray Kucera said Johnstown. I went to the dime store with Ann. I had an air gun rifle and was going out for target practice."
"0009"	"(07/16/49)"	"Puddleduck and a Kennedy or Eddy horse was running the same day. I was playing them at a $100 and I had a feeling they were going to win. I saw the entries in the paper. The horse with Puddleduck was Mike, milk, mursing. I was eating bananas in the fruit store. I was carrying something under my arm. Jack J. said, ""Don't drop it or touch anything with it."" I crawled into a hay loft after him, then he was in the yard and I took the two pieces in my hand and said, ""Why is this so important? I can't touch anything with it."" He took it from me and handled it roughly. It was something that brought people back when they were about dead. I thought of my brother Joe. Rose was there and she razzed me how I was carrying the object. I was looking at the mountains. It was cloudy or fog. Then it cleared and my vision was clear. I saw snow. And I looked at a peak way far in the distance and could see a large tree. I went over the Hilt's shop. I thought of a bull chasing me. I would go into the shop and he wouldn't get me. I went into the shop. It was barren empty. A boy came in and I said, ""What you doing here?"" and he asked me the same thing. I said, ""I am partner and have a key. "" I go into the next room and I see a gang of people coming in. They were going to have a party. I looked for my shoes and found them. They were the old oily shoes I worked in by Hilt's. I was at Mary Drular's. She had a small blond baby. I played with her and took her out was to baby sit. I was to go to work, but I didn't. I said, ""I'm too tired,"" and it was late at night."
"0010"	"(07/17/49)"	"There was a herd of cattle. Mr. Babary and a boy used to watch over the hill. Someone used to open up the gate and the cattle ran wild. I opened up the gate once and let them out. About 85% of the cattle were lost."
"0011"	"(07/17/49)"	"My dad and I talked to someone and he said, ""Joe G. was a black prince."" I bowed to him and said, ""I am bowing to a black prince"" and laughed. I saw Joe G. coming. I said, ""Here comes the black prince."" We passed Joe and he gave us a big smile. I could see his large teeth and not an honest smile."
"0012"	"(07/18/49)"	"I went to see Dr. Cooperman with Barbara and Audrey. His office was changed. He went up on a high wall to get into his office. It seemed to be off the basement in our old house. There was a lot of rubbish around I was to get rid of. I picked up a bottle. It seemed to have oil of some kind. Cooperman called me in, then he got a book of pictures and said Audrey looks like this girl, a certain hairdo and Barbara like another picture with a certain hairdo. Ann got pies for everyone."
"0013"	"(07/18/49)"	"There was a black bear in our basement. I locked the door and got the shotgun. The bear was coming up the stairs. I shot him, but he came right up and it turned out to be Sister Mary. I was hitting her on the head with the shotgun."
"0014"	"(07/18/49)"	"There was a deep ditch beside the house. It was for a foundation. There was clay in the bottom."
"0015"	"(07/19/49)"	"Ann and I were in church. Mike Forester was usher. He bawled us out for giving a quarter in the collection basket. Then he told me I was not an operator."
"0016"	"(07/19/49)"	"I didn't know how to grind the tools."
"0017"	"(07/19/49)"	"I was playing bingo. An old friend of my boyhood days was mentioned. A fellow knew him. His name was Raymond."
"0018"	"(07/19/49)"	"This man gave away a couple of tens. A little boy came over to my cards and mixed them."
"0019"	"(07/20/49)"	"Ann  was sleeping on the roof. She had a bench with a back rest. She stood up and was leaning back and I yelled at her not to do that. It would break. But she wouldn't listen to me and all at once it broke and down she went off the roof. I got scared. I looked at my children and said, ""Oh, goodbye, Mother."" I ran outside."
"0020"	"(07/20/49)"	"Barbara was sleeping. All at once she started to laugh and kick and rub her feet together. I woke her up and she dreamed her feet itched."
"0021"	"(07/20/49)"	"I was in the dime store and took something out that I didn't pay for. I was seen and was laid for, but they never caught me with the goods. I was there with Ann and children. I bought a couple of midget autos for him. I saw a toy train on the way home. Dark clouds were coming and I got on the streetcar to get home"
"0022"	"(07/20/49)"	"George Jaske came to me and said his pistol shoots four shots at once. I didn't believe him. So he put four shells in and told me to shoot. I did and the gun pinched my hand a little."
"0023"	"(07/20/49)"	"Ann bought me two nice neckties."
"0024"	"(07/20/49)"	"I saw a lot of blackberries. I asked a farmer if I could pick the berries and he talked about something."
"0025"	"(07/20/49)"	"I was riding on a freight car, then I flew off. I was walking then in deep snow."
"0026"	"(07/21/49)"	"I was put into a safely guarded iron fence and bulls came out but couldn't get at me. They showed me or were to make me dream of bulls."
"0027"	"(07/21/49)"	"A beautiful girl was brought in front of me to tempt me, but couldn't faze me. Then another one came with me and took me outside. I looked out and saw snow on the ground and beautiful white clouds floating by. I saw candy on the street. I picked some of it up and ate it. I stepped over cars as they came by."
"0028"	"(07/21/49)"	"I was in the basement and a fire was going. Water from a valve was running to the fire and circling around the drain sewer, but it was not taking it all and the water was putting out the coals. I shut the valve a little more and it slowed down. My dad had a long piece of bacon cut in strips and I was to take one. I tried to turn the bacon over and it was kind of awkward in the long hooked up strips."
"0029"	"(07/22/49)"	"We were trying out a shotgun with Andy P. It shot to the right side. I shot at a piece of paper on the street that was moving and hit it. A news boy was behind it and he yelled at us. He was lying in the ditch by the curb stone. Someone threw out Bob's red rubber ball. It bounced, but I didn't want to ruin his ball."
"0030"	"(07/22/49)"	"Ann and I were talking to Alice Rudolph on 68th St. A car came by and made a racket. I looked around and I thought Bob put an old step ladder and a straight one on the street. The car ran over them and ruined them. I bawled Bob out for doing that."
"0031"	"(07/22/49)"	"I drove my car in the house. I bumped the wall with my bumper. I told Ann that Prince will give me hell that I ruined his house."
"0032"	"(07/22/49)"	"We walked down past the school house in Rivertown to an old frog pond. There was water in it and ice was on the sides of the pond. The water moved back and forth as though there was a force moving it. It came to the center, then moved out to the sides as the water does on a big lake from large waves. Bob picked up a stick and was going to play with it in the water, but I said, ""No, you can't. The water is filthy."" Some water came out of a pipe and I touched it with my fingers, and it was dirty. There were two fellows with us. One had on a tan, another a white, and I a green shirt. One fellow laid in the pond and another one monkeyed around, leaning back to the pond and holding on to me. He went all the way down and I held on to him and picked him upright. I saw clear water coming into the pond. I followed the stream by eye and a water hydrant was open by some kid so the pond wouldn't go dry."
"0033"	"(07/22/49)"	"I went down by the river. it was dammed. I walked about three quarters across, then stopped and told the kids, ""Stay back. I think it will break."" I ran back. Audrey was ducking in the water and people were swimming in the river below the dam."
"0034"	"(07/22/49)"	"I was loving up my children. My sister Mary was by the table with a  movie actress. She was my girl. I reached over, grabbed her by the hand, pulled her over and kissed her. My children seemed to be my brother and sisters."
"0035"	"(07/22/49)"	"We were in the shop and I saw oil running on the floor. I was barefooted. I told Bill Grove the oil seemed to come out of the floor. He went downstairs and water started to gush out. Then spray. It got me wet. I could see a sewer drain when it stopped. We sat in the locker room and Mitchkash sat with us. I knew he was dead. He looked young and I was going to ask him if a steel bull was going to win his race, but I was backward."
"0036"	"(07/22/49)"	"This actress got on the bed posts and was going to do some stunts. She knocked the shades off two windows and Mary was cursing under her breath."
"0037"	"(07/23/49)"	"I was flying. A boy was monkeying around, so I got hold of him and flew him off the ground. I was in a forest. I looked into the forest and say some of the hills are barren where trees were taken out. I looked at a sign for a trail to where x-ray outfit was. A fellow was told he changed. Was his wife happy because he worked steady for a change? His pal tried to get him to play hooky and go to a ball game, but he walked away and I looked and he was doing a wash on a washboard. The other fellow laughed, but I said, ""He's in love with his wife, but that will wear off in a while."" I was taking a stroll with Ann and some other woman. Ann acted funny, wasn't satisfied that I didn't take her some other place of amusement instead."
"0038"	"(07/23/49)"	"I was flying over fences and I noticed vacant homes. I looked at the street numbers and it was around 138. Barbara had a job at the White's and I came to see her and there were a lot of pencil erasers on the floor. I was picking them up, then I saw one of my time slips made out in a new system which I didn't understand. I was operating machines. I made an aluminum pin. The snap gauge I used was left over from the previous setup. I got the right one, and I noticed it fit the piece and I was safe, no scrap."
"0039"	"(07/23/49)"	"A fellow told me after looking at race 7 that he played In Mind and he was going to win and play a bundle. They didn't care much for steel bull. The jockey's name was Frapka and a cross was in back of his name or rather following it. I was crabby at Ann and the kids, then I had some cake and milk and one of the boys said, ""What a difference in you, now that after you ate,"" and we started to laugh."
"0040"	"(07/25/49)"	"I picked a horse and fooled the outcome. I beat him to something. I was looking for a bottle of whiskey in Toney's stock room. I found it and there was $41.70 on the label. Herman was making some kind of dressing for military funeral in the Far East. I was working in the shop. I went into the hallway and looked up at the ceiling. There was a small round hole with a glass in it. I took a good look and I could see thru it. There was a young fellow with his penis out of his pants, showing it to me. I heard someone say, ""Speedy baby, good old speedy baby."""
"0041"	"(07/26/49)"	"I was in Penner's house. He was asleep. The water was turned on and at a distance I could see the water spraying out of the windows and Penner was outside looking at us. He had a shop of handscrew machines and all the White boys were working for him. I came late to work and was changing my clothes. My bare rear end was exposed and the girls could see me if they looked. A fellow told me, ""Will you go back to White's when they settle in their new place?"" Han Sergert told the boss, ""Why don't you burr the pieces first, then thread them?"" but he didn't pay any attention to Hank."
"0042"	"(07/26/49)"	"There was  real heavy rain, thunder and lightning (storm). The wind blew and the lightning and thunder was heavy. The flashes were close and bright. Bob and Cecila Lippert were there. Bob got drunk and he acted out of place. I was surprised to see him like that. Mary Hutter was there. We were sleeping in beds. This was a shelter like. Then the windows blew in and we awoke some people and told them to move back into the building. Bob was so drunk, he lay face down on the floor and the rain came down on him. The storm finally abated and we started to leave. I got into my car and we left. Then I saw the federal men running away from the crowd. The FBI's. I was a federal man, so I ran into the bank and we had all the doors and exits locked and no one was to leave till we had a checkup and a report. I came into the bank after it was all over and there was a gang holding it up. I had no gun. They made me lay on my back. Then they poured some kind of powder and a liquid around me and ignited it. I was going to take off my overcoat and put out the fire on my back, but I was told to keep it on till they got out. I had to show them the way out. Then, when they were out, I took the coat off and doused it into a puddle of water. I was going to catch a bus from downtown with Joe. I yelled at him to wait for me and I would ride with him. The bus that we were to take, it hit a deep puddle and turned a turtle. A girl and a couple boys flew out and were nude in the cold water. I gave my overcoat to cover them so they wouldn't be cold."
"0043"	"(07/26/49)"	"We had a small baby in the crib. Art Urban was lying with him in the crib. I heard Ann Evans tell Grandpas that I had won $100 on my horses. Three of them won."
"0044"	"(07/26/49)"	"I sat on the steps in Rivertown and I looked and saw thick pieces of paint. I asked Ann what that was after I got some gray paint on my hands. She had the paint six inches thick in some places on the steps. Ann was chasing me down an ice street. I would stop and she would slide right by. She was mad. A man came at me with a square steel bar. He was angry. I got hold of the bars and told him to put them down and fight, but he wouldn't."
"0045"	"(07/26/49)"	"Julia Gibson had a pair of trunks on and she showed a man a long dagger she carried. Bud told her if anyone got funny with her, she should run it thru him. A gang of fellows came over and they were feeling pretty drunk. One man sat by the table and I thought I was going to get some money. He mentioned Steve and then $30. Someone came over and it was to be a secret, so we went into a bedroom and there it was, $60. A new church was mentioned."
"0046"	"(07/27/49)"	"I was working in the shop and Grandpas, Steve and I were sleeping at Margie's. It seemed like in Rivertown upstairs and still Prince was her landlord. I was downstairs, heard a knock on the door and told Marg, ""If it's Prince, tell him I am sleeping."" I got on top of the stairs. I looked down and saw Prince look up at me. I got in bed with Grandpas. Steve and Marg came up and said Prince wanted to see us. I looked at the winning paper and one came in second and I didn't see one and the other ran out."
"0047"	"(07/28/49)"	"I found a bracelet on the floor and Audrey said it was a girlfriend's of hers from school. I said, ""I want to try it on."" She didn't want me to. I gave her a tough answer and sister Ann was there with Mitzie. Ann gave me a sarcastic answer. I bawled her out, told her she had a big mouth like and worse than her sister Mary. I ordered her off my porch. She went off, but came back and got a handful of silverware, including a bread knife, and held it above her head threatening me. She was a big, husky woman, taller than I. I took all the silver out of her hand and she picked up more. I was kind of afraid of her. I saw a movie of a man sitting on a large scale. He had a pile of cabbage and lettuce. He talked and then ate the cabbage. I had a head of cabbage and ate it. Arnold came by and said, ""If I had a chance like you, I would make good use of it."" I told him I did. I ate. I saw a small boy run across the street in front of a car. Three women walked down the street. Mickey M. wanted to take me as a prisoner. I picked up a small copper hammer and gave him a couple of hits on the head, but it didn't faze him. There was a big assembly of White workers at the plant. There was dust at Rivertown. I told the boys it was from the cinder roads that the company made. I lay on the bed with my small son and I covered him and just his small head shown."
"0048"	"(07/28/49)"	"Sacred Vow 91.00. I saw that on a paper. Someone showed it to me. Delatt wanted me to call in a bet. I said no. So he put down a dime for me and I said no."
"0049"	"(07/28/49)"	"A young college student wanted me to nail his sheet on a table next to another one. The table was round and there were a lot of nails sticking out of it. I pulled them all out, then nailed the sheet down for him."
"0050"	"(07/29/49)"	"I was at a Jewish celebration. I met a Jewish girl. I liked her and she went for me. We took a stroll and then we were married. We were way up in Canadian wilds looking for her long-lost father. A mounted policeman was to search the wilds for her dad. We had a map and were in the section where he was to be. We walked thru a cave and the mounted policeman said, ""How are we going to find the opening here? This is 1500 miles long."" We finally came to an opening and I looked down to another section of the cave. It was high. I could see the father-in-law there. I yelled at him, but he paid no attention to me. He walked under cover, then my wife came from under cover and she told him who she was. And then his wife came with other friends and there really was a reunion. When he found out he was united with his wife and child, it was a beautiful scene to see them embrace."
"0051"	"(07/29/49)"	"Grandpas, Bob and I went thru a door and there were two bulls -- a brown one and a white bull. I noticed the bull come at us, so I went back and closed the door. The white bull's head came in the doorway, but I made him pull his head back and I closed the door. I saw big eyes on some kind of a large fowl. I gave Grandpas a rifle and told him to shoot their eyes out."
"0052"	"(07/30/49)"	"A gorilla tried to catch me, but I flew up into the air and on top of the GTHS high school. I looked down and it was high. I jumped and flew again. I worked magic. I made objects come to me at will. I was going to school with my old school day friends again. I was watching the streetcar go by and the kids were getting on. I stood on the tracks and gave the signal when the kids were on to go. The owner's wife has two streetcar passes she was to sell. Ann said, ""Sell them to my husband,"" but she said, ""I might give them to my husband."" I told her he didn't need a pass because he was the owner of the line and all the motormen knew him."

"0054"	"(07/31/49)"	"I had to enlist into the army and was going to an army camp. I carried an extra heavy load of wood home. I was going to work on a certain job in the shop and a woman always took my large box. I got peeved at her and told her I was not to furnish her with boxes."
"0055"	"(07/31/49)"	"Joe Violets. I asked an engineer for a tip today and that's what he told me."
"0056"	"(07/31/49)"	"Cecila Lippert came to work with her baby girl. I tried to make the baby smile, but it wouldn't. It was puny and looked old. She sat on the steps to wait for Bob. A fellow came over and stepped on her foot, then squeezed her knee, which hurt her knee. She complained. Bob sat above her and stuck his foot at the guy's hand and pressed it away. Then he got up and to work. I quit ahead of time, stopped by the railroad track and was making out my time. I picked a couple of apples off an apple tree. The boys at the shop told me some kind of Hill sun or Baron or Barameter was running and was hot."
"0057"	"(07/31/49)"	"Grandpas was a fireman of a boiler. The fire was going good. I told him his fire was good enough, then the safety steam valve opened up and the steam came out. I asked him if he had a whistle on the boiler. So I blew the whistle. It was not so loud and a lot of steam came out."

"0061"	"(08/01/49)"	"I was driving and I had venetian blinds on the outside of my car. They were not separated right and my view was bad, so I stuck my hand out and tried to set them and they stretched out and broke. They were uneven and I told Bill Grove about them. He said he would get a guy to fix them. A fellow came out of the office with a machine and was going to fix them."
"0062"	"(08/01/49)"	"There were teams of 6 horses that were going to race. In one set I saw two bulls hooked up between the horses. There were a lot of trees in the track, which would interfere if the horses didn't run even and straight. I saw a big pile of logs."
"0063"	"(08/02/49)"	"Watches were seen by me on a large piece of paper that unfolded. In a dark doorway I was to become or was a priest. I sat in the church and had a small copper hammer in my hand. My sister and other people I knew were standing and I sat and through that of giving them the seat, but I was a priest and should not."
"0064"	"(08/02/49)"	"We were on a high cliff looking down. Bob and Barbara came over to me. They ran over a small path near the edge of the cliff, at my command, because an avalanche was coming. I stood behind a cliff and held Bob and Barbara close to me so the rocks wouldn't hit them. There were two baskets. Barbara said Aunt Mary was to use one for ashes."

"0070"	"(08/08/49)"	"A gang of boys from the Whites were together, talking of what we did when we first started to work at the Whites. I was kind of flying around. The big shots of the camp came by and we had to get out of the way or they would run us down. There were a lot of trees around. I put on an oil spout on a machine and it squirted all over and high up like a spray. I threw an object and it flew back and forth like a rocket."
"0071"	"(08/08/49)"	"I was in Rivertown and I wanted to see what I could dream of to play a winning horse, but couldn't. I tried to look, they fly, but I didn't fly so high. I got my feet wet so I went by Grandma. My sister Ann wanted me to go by Sue and teach her to drive a car. She gave me dry socks. I was on St. Clair and there was a coal yard there instead of a gas station. I was looking for coal in the woodwork and couldn't find it. I looked in the form and saw Busy Pony starting his season."
"0072"	"(08/09/49)"	"I was smoking a cigar. I sat in a field smoking. I looked and saw the trees trimmed down quite low. A girl told Barbara to go into the house, that someone might throw something at her because it was getting dark. There was a gang trying to get me. I would throw them off. Then I got a gun and gave them a few scare shots, but they wouldn't scare easily. I got into the house. A big fellow came at me, but I held him at bay, then flew and lost the gang. I fired up the furnace because it was getting chilly and over night it would get cold."
"0073"	"(08/10/49)"	"I watched girls riding motorcycles and some of them were completely nude. Then they walked and were nude. They looked into a mirror. I saw a horse walk over us. He had large thick legs like an elephant. Then I noticed he was headless and was after me. I flew over fences and shanties, over and into trees and he still chased me. There was a lot of money that was Station's and it was being asked. I grabbed a bundle of it. There were 50's and tens."
"0074"	"(08/11/49)"	"It was quitting time. We rushed up and washed our hands in a large pail on the soda tanks."
"0075"	"(08/11/49)"	"I was in Rivertown and was told to play baseball. I saw Bill Grove and Marty Cristovich batting balls. I picked up a bat and swung it for practice. Then I knocked a few balls out. I picked up a hickory nut and broke it. It was rotten and a few more were wormy with holes in them. I went into the cupboard to get some peanuts and they were on an upper shelf. I reached for some and they started to roll out. I caught them with my hands and they kept rolling. I put some in my mouth to eat them, and I had a hard time to keep them from rolling on the floor."
"0076"	"(08/12/49)"	"I saw a man get beat up and a kid was putting him into a cave or cellar to hide him from his assailant who was beating up another man. A lookout was looking thru a field glass and he saw where the boy was hiding the man."
"0077"	"(08/12/49)"	"Dad and I got a prisoner tied and put him into a closet. Later we saw two men come out. We scrutinized them, then I saw one come out. I gave orders to capture him. He was our prisoner in disguise. He had guns on him. My man had a knife, but just like magic there were men on all sides of him and he was captured."
"0078"	"(08/13/49)"	"The story Blue-Green, the big party at the White sewing machine for 25 year service men. I was going to it for dinner."
"0079"	"(08/13/49)"	"I flew into a tunnel where there was a creek running thru. I saw some friends sitting on a bench. They called me, so I flew over. Then a short way off I saw Rose. She called me over, so I flew over to where she was."
"0080"	"(08/14/49)"	"A nice girl was with Delta and Ann. She liked me. She put on a thin slip and you could see her shape. Then she laid in bed and said she was cold. I went in bed with her and held her tight to keep her warm. Someone pulled the covers off us. Then we went into another room and the girl put on a small bit of hair under her nose. I found some hair and put them under my nose and said, ""Let's see how a kiss is with a  mustache."" My lips were pricked like from hers. Then she stood behind a mirror and half of her lip was showing from behind the mirror. I came close and she had a picture of a football on them. Then she took off the cellophane and put them over her eyes as glasses. I kissed her again and Ann came in. We were in a bedroom again and someone knocked on the door. We looked and it was a colored man. Pearl let him in. He came to the bed and there was a bunch of kids including Bobby. One little baby shit on the bed and the others scattered it. The colored man looked at the wall and pearl had pictures stuck on the wall. He said he was selling them. He patted each one of the kids on the back, including Bob."
"0081"	"(08/15/49)"	"I asked people if Scipio and Mr. Dumjohn would win, and no one would answer yes or no. I took it for granted that they would win. I had a small gas motor and had trouble with it. I took it apart and then it was hard to put together again."
"0082"	"(08/16/49)"	"I was in someone's house with Ann, Bob and Audrey. We sat on a bed like and there were two girls and a fellow. Ann said, ""Don't these people look familiar to you?"" I said, ""Yes, they do."" They were a troupe that played in an aviation picture. I was eating bread. The girl came over and took all the inside of the bread and ate it. I picked up the crust and ate that. Then we went on a trip to new York City. We were on a streetcar. The streets were deserted and I could see the car had big wheels on and it ran on the street where there was no track. I said, ""This is a dream."" Then my family got off and there was one horse there. He seemed to be wild and I saw a house. We ran for the house, but I knew the horse would catch me and trample me. But he didn't. I was scared. Had my hands over my head waiting for the hooves to drop on my head. He turned into a large, playful dog. I picked a couple balls at Mike Gocan. I heard Blue Jay is one. I was in New York riding the subway and walking in it. I told a kid I was taking a train to Rivertown, PA. Then Primiontown, PA. I got mad at Ann. I gave her all the money I had, including my change. She was going on a big liner on a trip. I looked for a stick, broom handle. I was watching a tabulation of donations in New York."
"0083"	"(08/18/49)"	"I went to Mickey's. He had to go to serve in prison. Then it was like his mother. He had to go for his mother to a certain time. We waited for him. He was racing with a lion. There was a daily double won by a dime."
"0084"	"(08/18/49)"	"I had 3 drums of ready-mixed with water cement. I was to let it stand in the drums overnight, then use it. We had a cannon in our yard. Ann drove my car and it tipped front end up. She got frightened and climbed out of it. I was riding a freight and it went over a safety switch which wrecks cars. It seemed to go off the truck. I yelled at the other brakeman to signal a stop. He did and it stopped."
"0085"	"(08/18/49)"	"I went to work and our department was empty. All the machines were moved to the new plant."
"0086"	"(08/19/49)"	"A lady came in to buy some boards. I had some old ones and they had a heavy mess wire on them. She was going south. She stood beside me and was she tall, about 8 ft. - a tall lady. People were moving south on old wagons and old style cars. We stopped to see some people we knew for direction to a certain part of the town. We sat in the car and thought they would recognize us, but they didn't. Mary and I bought a large brick home on E. 30th St. It had a basement like a large tenement house. It had four floors. There were porches the length of the front of the house. All across the front was on all four floors. The yard was big and the lawn was bad because there were a lot of kids jumping on the roof. It was low then. We had all the furniture in the house. I said we would get a nice price for our furniture. The furnace was gas and it was going full blast. The beds were big and soft."
"0087"	"(08/19/49)"	"I saw a lot of ducks. They were swimming and I saw two mating. I got my shotgun and was going to shoot some. Picked one out and shot and a girl hunter yelled, ""I'm no duck."""
"0088"	"(08/19/49)"	"Johnnie Matuck and Peter were put into a glass-sided patrol wagon because Pete got porky. When the cop wasn't looking, he made a run for home and got away. The policeman ran the wrong way. I walked out of the union supply store in Rivertown and sat on a step and found out I was in the large display window. There was a nice girl playing with my toes. And a fellow was barefooted and he put his toes against me and wiggled them. I saw he looked like he had athlete's foot, so I pulled my foot away from him."
"0089"	"(08/21/49)"	"Audrey made a fire and some lumber on a streetcar was burning. I went for the hose. I got in my car and it rolled out into the street and against the streetcar. The car gave it a push and it ran into a post and smashed up. There was a fire in Rivertown and I went for a hose, but couldn't put it on this faucet because it was a junk faucet. I rode on a streetcar. I saw a high peak in Rivertown. I said, ""I don't remember seeing this before."" I looked up at it and it was steep and high. There were trees on top. We were going to go thru a cow field. I said, ""No, you will get chased by a bull."" Someone went into the field, then ran back. A bull rushed the fence and came thru it. We ran away. I had a #11 on my back. I was nominated as representative. I saw two wood piles. We were along the lake and then went into a pool to swim. Men were wading thru the lake. People were swimming in the lake. I was in a cap and hat store. I told the proprietor how come he didn't wear a hat or cap if he wanted someone to wear them. I saw a red-haired toupee. Steve T. had his head bandaged."
"0090"	"(08/21/49)"	"There was a short circuit in a high school where I was a student. The boys were playing games and were getting shocked and sparks and flashes were coming up thru the ground. I called Illuminating Co. and a man came and I told him where it was and he seemed not to believe me. Then more men came and checked it, but didn't seem to find it. I had a dream that wild bull won and paid a bundle. Some woman told me she had a 71 to 1 in a race and she thought he wouldn't win. He didn't get a first, but was a winner. I borrowed a pencil from a student, then gave it back. I said I had one in my desk."
"0091"	"(08/21/49)"	"There were holes in the ground and puffs of smoke were coming out like smoke signals. I went underground to see the boys doing it, but the meeting was over. I picked up a carpet and ran out with it. One of the boys saw me. He yelled at the other boys, but before they could come out, I was gone. There were police with clubs. They were using sticks to chase out a yellow snake that was mean. I had a stick, but I noticed I was barefooted, so I just stayed out of the grass. There was a reunion of women who came to our house, and they walked thru our house in sort of a singing and praying march. We were at the cemetery and it was freshly dug and covered. Marie Lasko was to have been buried beside George and Michael. I was out pheasant hunting, and it was only a stick in my hand, so then I picked up a repeater shotgun and blasted at the pheasants."
"0092"	"(08/22/49)"	"The bank or side of the hill along of shore way was put into green grass and corn came up amongst it. Some spots were bare and I talked of fertilizing it. I talked with a lenarcic. There were a lot of planes maneuvering over the lake. They dove into the water with the nose and half of the plane submerged. Then they came up and took up. I was close and they looked like toy planes. There were two large horses like elephants. We had a small one and I didn't want to go near them. I went around where I thought I would miss them and here they were looking at us at close range. I gave out a yell and threw up my hands and that frightened them and they ran away. There was all kinds of excitement. Ann was going to fry me some potatoes."
"0093"	"(08/23/49)"	"I looked at a book that had some races at Randall, a horse paid $920 for third and another $400 for third and another $120 for third. Walter had the book. The one that paid $920 had a picture of an arrow tied to a rope and the arrow went thru a tree. A woman was taking a picture of the mutuals."
"0094"	"(08/24/49)"	"We were swimming in a small pool of water and playing ball for some manager; on Trust was thought my mind. Bill Grove and I were looking at Joe G's racing car. We tried to start it, but it wouldn't go. I was looking at a paper with G.G. to see if on Trust was running. He said he was, but I could not see him."
"0095"	"(08/25/49)"	"I met a Brazen Brother. He gave me a petition and said, ""Sign one, fill it out."" It was $58 for him. I said, ""Is it taxes?"" He said no. He showed me a picture of landscaping. I said, ""I don't need that. I will use fertilizer."" I showed him where the house was before it was moved. You could see the lawn was in bad shape. Then I had a dream I won. They came in. Air Commander paid $19. I looked at the paper for results and I just saw this one. It was marked 13.9 that I was to come and collect."
"0096"	"(08/25/49)"	"Uncle Joe and Grandpas took some kind of poison and they became hoarse. Grandpas said he was not hoarse, so he took another one and he became hoarse and didn't want to eat. I was self-conscious of poisoning them. I walked on a very high bridge."
"0097"	"(08/26/49)"	"Bob B. came to my mind. Grandpas went to Europe to visit and there was a threat of war and he was stranded there. I went into a store and saw a lot of Immies and candy. I got an album made and when Bob got it from the mail man, he tore the cover off it and I didn't like it, so I went back to the store and asked what they would charge to put on a new cover, and the girl said 95 cents. I was watching a movie and radio performance. A gang of colored men and a woman came over and Uncle Joe told them how a gang of colored guys announce a colored ball game and get $2000 for it. He paid a nigger and a dog started to bark at him."
"0098"	"(08/27/49)"	"I had a fire in a tunnel I made and the fire got red hot. I looked into it. I got down into a hole with Ann and pulled out a large weed and threw it into the fire. I went into a bookie joint and met Mike. He gave me a scratch sheet. I looked at Hazel Park. Bobby was with me. He went over to play with two small dogs and one growled at him and I told him to get away from them."
"0099"	"(08/28/49)"	"I was winning a lot of money on horses. I was stuffing it into my wallet. I played some Blue Sonnet or something similar. I was collecting money in church to be for someone whom was in need. I held out my hand instead of a basket and when my hand was full, I put it into my pocket. I was being chased for stealing that money, then I was the chaser. It was a small boy. I shot at him in the rafters. Then I finally captured him. I saw a lot of large bulls. I flew up before they started after me. I was climbing up and down walls after Julia Gibson and she was mad at me."
"0100"	"(08/28/49)"	"I played 3-1/2 + R plays and they all came in. It was two gold horses; one was Count Gold."
"0101"	"(08/29/49)"	"We threw large rocks on a goose, then I grabbed it by the neck and my friend slit his throat and blood oozed out. The watchman came out, so I grabbed the goose and was taking it home. I was locking the windows and doors so no burglars would come in. The window was hard to shut. It seemed to be sprung a bit."
"0102"	"(08/29/49)"	"I was checking what came in and I had WOW. Wow was to have won."
"0103"	"(08/30/49)"	"I was traveling with Mccinnis. We were in PA somewhere. We went in to eat and Mccinnis moved twice with his plate, then walked out without paying. He had his sweater on, then came in all dressed in a suit. I walked out with a gang going out without paying. I went out, then seemed to be a fugitive. A fellow tried to catch me, but I flew up into the air and got away. I was near a high stairway and jumped, then glided down and got away from another man. I walked thru a big furniture store. They tried to sell me furniture. Then one man brought out a tray of diamond rings. I had two on my hand. I said I would be in Thursday, so they let me out."
"0104"	"(09/01/49)"	"C. Fisher found a cone. It had a nail on the end. I said it was a good toad stabber. He threw it down. I picked it up and tried to stake coal on a coal pile and missed. Then I stabbed a lump and the spike went thru the coal."
"0105"	"(09/02/49)"	"I saw a lady and a man play some kind of golf on a boat. The lady was better than the man. Ann played with some rich man. Boy, could she hit the ball. She kind of fell for the guy and did he for her. I got mad at her for it. I could see her face light up when she saw him. I slapped her face, then walked away, expecting her to come after me, but she didn't and I walked away sadly."
"0106"	"(09/03/49)"	"I looked at a house number. It was 34010. A man was looking for it. I looked at it twice. A tennis ball rolled down the hill. I picked it up and threw it to a boy who missed it. I ran from my car down the street backwards. I saw two Brinks guards, one with a pistol, another with a rifle run on top of a hill and shoot once. The rifle man said it was a tight squeeze for the bullet to go thru the rifle barrel. Cecila and Bob came over to me and she was dressed nice. She tried to get my attention, then she did. I said, ""Oh, hello."" I was lying on the bed looking out the window."
"0107"	"(09/04/49)"	"I was coloring cups golden color. There were steeples in the cups. Helen L. and another girl came to me in the shop and I made a donation for a cause. I had a large board leaning on the fence. It fell and I said, ""It's lucky no kids were here."" Then I leaned it on the fence so it wouldn't fall and it knocked the fence over down. A dog was barking at a butcher, so he threw a lot of meat on the ground for the dog. The dog smelled the meat and didn't harm the butcher. I saw a name ending in ette."
"0108"	"(09/07/49)"	"We were throwing rocks and they turned into birds and would fly in different directions. A man told us to kill them. We said, ""No, you do that yourself."" He threw me a pin to kill them. I looked at a door which was not fitted right. The walls were made of stone. There was such large holes on one side. I looked thru into another room and thought, ""What if someone came thru the door to harm any of us?"" I had a stick and I would wait for them to come thru the door. Then I would hit them on the head. I threw the stick or piece of wood thru the hole. Then I saw my sister Mary sneaking to the door. I ran to one corner and picked up a stone and when she came thru, I threw it and hit the stone wall near Mary. I said, ""What are you up to?"" and she tried to bribe me not to harm her. I went down into the basement and the furnace was almost out. I fixed it, then there was a nice flame and there were large lumps of coke. I went upstairs and found out I forgot to put out the basement light. I could see the light on thru a window in the floor. A young fellow was parting with his girl. She had a lace in front of her face off her hat. Then it turned out to be a branch of a Christmas tree. He kissed her and started to walk away and ran into branches of a tree. He thought it was his girl and perked up his lips to kiss. I saw a bunch of young trees in a plot. They had large leaves, green and red streaked. The leaves were very large. There was a well in our coal shed and some gang wanted to drown a young lady who found out about the gold. I came in later and Audrey and another girl were giving Bob artificial respiration. They said there was another girl drowned in there. I reached down and pulled her out. I told the kids to run into the house and tell mother to call the police, firemen. My sister Sue was held by me as the culprit who tried to drown the kids. The cops came and I told them to take Sue. One reporter gave me a belt. He said this was a reward. I saw a bear running in my direction. I climbed over a roof, then flew away. This was a green bear. He was to have escaped from a farmer. He had a head like a hippopotamus. I looked for my bowling bag in a gym and my shoes were cracked on the bottom. Ann had a hole thru her hand. I could see thru it. I told her and she wouldn't believe it. I held her hand by a light and showed her it was a hole. Then I noticed I had one also. I was riding Barbara on a bicycle and I could ride it good. We were going on a trip to PA with Peter A. He drove my station wagon part way. I was running thru the rain."
"0109"	"(09/07/49)"	"Two of my boyhood days' friends were in business and they went bankrupt. I worked for them, then I quit. I met them and they were shy because they failed."
"0110"	"(09/08/49)"	"All is set. On top of the shanty I was pushing a new kind of toy car. It was to run indefinitely. There were two of them. They would get stuck in the weeds and I would have to give them a lift out of the weeds. Then they would go. A lady was loading a bag with milk bottles and head lettuce and the bag broke. A blonde lady sat on a stable top with little Bobby and a different small baby. I saw a picture of a shotgun shell 6 inches long. John T. shot at me with his shotgun. I ran for cover and saw someone moving in the tall weeds, so I shot over his head."
"0111"	"(09/11/49)"	"You'll be sorry. I dreamed Grandma Meyer got spanked by a priest and everyone was against the priest. I was going with Al D. to his dept. to see his work. We saw a tiny boxcar on the rack. When the priest was spanking Grandmas, I threw a newspaper on the spot he was spanking her thru a window. A fellow was showing, pointing at a big pile of coal way out in the distance. He said, ""See it?"" I said, ""Yes, I do."" We were working in the shop running machines and the machines were fruit trees. I counted farmer's trees and he had 7 of them. I counted them again and six were fruit trees. Joe A. threw a pear to Kotnik and Kotnik moved my arm a little and missed it. We ran for it. I went to the left and he to the right and he found it. I walked up on the road and found a large marble. I threw it down below on the road. It bounded and Kotnik picked it up. I found another shooter. I saw a lot of trains going by a small country settlement of my boyhood days. They were excavating the settlement for new homes."
"0112"	"(09/12/49)"	"I was in the screw dept. and it was dark in there. There was something the matter with the switch. Louie gave me a saucer of hot water to hold and he forced the switch. I went over to the machines and some women were running them and #27 was moved. There was a dog tied to a chain. I took the chain and put it on nails around a barn. There was a scene as the end of the world. The earth crumbled and people disappeared into it screaming. We went on top of a mountain. I looked into the sky and saw a Technicolor picture of a man killing his two brothers with a dagger. Then I saw kings kissing young girls, teenagers. A policeman bawled me out for not driving right around the turn. He showed me I should drive about 3 ft. from the curb going around the curb. Grandpa said he had his will made out."
"0113"	"(09/13/49)"	"I caught a man violating the traffic laws. I was a cop. He tried to bribe me. He gave me a dollar bill and the other side was a $25. There was a gang putting acid on people's heads. They put acid on Audrey's, Bobbie's and Franklin's and Donna's head. I got after them. They put some on my head. So I grabbed the solution and put some on his head and face and got away. I saw Mother putting some on our baby's head. I threw lumps of coal at her. There was a man doing some stunts in the sky. He came down and there was a string tied to his back which took him up. Hank S. lived in Bratine. I saw two silver dollars and two gold dollars on a slant that someone bought an item from him and left the money."
"0114"	"(01/30/51)"	"Margie got married to Frankie. They left on a honeymoon. Grandma, Grandpa, Mary, Ann and Audrey and Barbara were dressed to meet her. One of the boys were backing my car up to park it and he bumped into a dog house. A big dog jumped on the side of my car and I was afraid he was going to bite me. I was going to pack my car and it turned out to be a chair in my hand, so I took it along with myself. I was in a colored neighborhood. Audrey and Barbara were examined by the colored doctor. He was nude when he was examining."
"0115"	"(01/31/51)"	"Tony Lasko made a high jump from an airplane or I watched him fly thru the air and land on his feet. I wasn't going to look, but I did. I saw a toy plane from the amusement park glide around. I watched it as it glided on its side. I picked up a large red tomato and was tempted to eat it, but put it in my car. I looked it over closely and it was nice. G. G. bawled Chipka out. He said, ""Now you tenants are going to use _ of the attic apiece."" I saw myself in school and I saw a fellow that was there and looked like a fellow that went to school with me 27 years ago. I was thinking why I didn't go to school and have a good education, but I had a pencil in my hand and said, ""I can make good with the education I have now."""
"0116"	"(02/01/51)"	"Seabecke was telling us what a fair deal he was giving us. I watched him thru a tube like. He came into our dept. The boys walked by him and said hello. I took a stroll by him and did the same. I was looking at a paper and saw three Johns and a Walter and I showed them to Walter. I saw Mabel L. I owned a big building. The basement was full of stores that were rented. I walked thru there and there were all kinds of stores there and ritzy and poor and colored people. I gave a colored lady a lift to her home with her groceries. There was a dog that was 14 years old and would run after everyone. The owner grabbed him when I walked by because he was ready to run after me. I saw had in the 2nd. We were going to play with pigeons. I said, ""They won't fly away because they come back."""
"0117"	"(02/02/51)"	"Brother Steve was in bed. I looked at him and thought to myself, he will get soldier bonus because he was in the World War II. I looked at Bill Grove's machine and there was oil running on the floor. I yelled at him, then I noticed from one of my machines there was oil also running on the floor. I kicked sawdust on the oil."
"0118"	"(02/03/51)"	"Pearl's brothers came to her house and beat up one of her brothers who was weak-witted. I told them that was not a very nice thing to do. I was upstairs and opened a window and said I was going to get those three and beat them up. Hilts and Don Delatt laughed at me. I caught up with them and one ran away, so I flew at him and caught him. He turned out to be Pearl. So I bawled her out and I slapped her face twice and told that if she just as much as thought evil of me, I would know and she would get more. I met the boys that were tough later and looked them in the eyes. They turned their gaze away meekly. Chipka was walking by me. I had a piece of wire in my hand, so I put it between his cheeks and he walked away with it that way."
"0119"	"(02/04/51)"	"I was going to school. I saw Joe Bistak, an old friend of ours, back at the White Sewing Machine Co."
"0120"	"(02/05/51)"	"We got a telephone call to go to St. Andrews Hall. They had a party there and the lady said for Ann and I to come down. They had whiskey and pop left. So we went. Ann sat on a chair by herself and some women sat on the other side. Barbara went to sit with the women. I picked up a chair and sat beside Ann. A little girl dressed in white was on her way to the party. We went inside and there was whiskey and pop. I got a large glass, double header glass full of whiskey. I spilled it into the sink and rinsed it out. I put some whiskey and coke and water, then milk into a glass and I drank it and it was good. It really went down and the whiskey was not sharp. We sat outside and all at once heavy black; some came our way and it had a bad odor. The smoke cleared and I saw a fire. They were burning off old cable. A fellow asked me how high the smokestacks were. They were about a mile away. I took a good look at them and there was a ladder leaning on one of them and it reached to the top. I told the boy the stacks were about 250 ft. high. I looked into the sky and I saw two planes flying. They looked like two planes. They bumped and one fell to the earth. I saw a lot of seagulls flying. They were from the Figi Islands. A dog made a big jump and fell flat when he dropped."
"0121"	"(02/06/51)"	"I was playing cards with Ray, Walter, and Julia, deceased tavern owner. I had a piece of wood in my hand for luck. We sat on a log. I was drawing coke out of a coke oven. There were wraps standing in a corner. A man walked into the hot oven. I went in to pick up the coat. It was like a cleaners. A man came in and wanted his coat cleaned and pressed. The lady said ""We're closed."" He pulled out a gun and took his coat to press. I walked into the other oven and there was a small window. I decided to get out. There was some glass in the corner of the window frame. I knocked it out and started to get thru the small window. I was getting thru head down the wall. Bob was in bed. I was going to go to the next room and he awoke and kicked because he didn't want to be left alone. I saw three women around a giant tree. One crawled thru a trunk of the tree and then they all ran. I laughed and said, ""They call them old buzzards."" We all laughed and I think she heard it. I started on my way and she followed me. I came to a barn. I flew at the locked door, but it didn't open. The old lady waited by another door. I opened it and said, ""Look behind you. There is something."" She looked and I got out. Trixie got hold of her broom and I grabbed it and threw it away, then went on my way. I put up a kite. It went straight up. Then it came down and flew right in front of a window and stood up. It was a beautiful dress. I was loving up and kissing Julia. Her kiss was so soft, her lips seemed to melt."
"0122"	"(02/07/51)"	"I drove to the gas station for a recharge of my battery. I put a silver dollar in my readier just to hold in the water, but it slipped out of my fingers and I dropped it into the bottom. I saw a case of beer. It was to be a party for my wife's shop. Chipka had a wash machine. He had a register for registering the rental fee and he watched how the price went up to what he paid for it, then he would be happy to see that he was gaining money. He was waiting for $24 to pop up. We walked by for presents. I got 2 popcorn balls, then the man called me back and took the popcorn back and gave me a poppyseed roll instead. I was eating it as I walked back. I went into St. Andrew's Church. People were going to confession. Steve came in and got in line of confession. I had the car in the garage for some new parts."
"0123"	"(02/08/51)"	"Joe and Steve drank up my whiskey. They let two bottles of beer in the basement. Peter Arendas, Brother Steve and I were in a car. Peter was driving. We were going thru the square. We hit a lot of traffic. I watched the light and I said, ""Go,"" and it was stop. Steve saw some pennies on the ground. He went over and picked one up, then another. He picked them so slow another guy jumped in and picked the other 3 up. Peter started to run. Steve held me back. I broke lose and ran way ahead of Pete, then I jumped up and landed on top of a building. They went in and I flew to where I thought they would come out. I saw a donkey also and his master and a boy. I went into a building and these biblica persons were playing some kind of game. They made funny signs in writing that I couldn't understand. The boy tried to work them out, but was always wrong. I wanted to put the bed light on, but it wouldn't go on. I saw a lot of shoes in front of the door. I put on the wall switch and the bed light went on."
"0124"	"(02/09/51)"	"Shrimpy. The last kiss came to me. I was winning money on the horses down the shop. Every now and then I would get ten or fifteen dollars in cash."
"0125"	"(02/10/51)"	"I was riding a trolley with a fellow. Then I took a train and the train passed the trolley I usually ride and I saw the fellow I rode with in the trolley as the train passed it. I got off and was going to walk home, but I noticed it was dark and I thought I might be held up, so I decided to ride the trolley. I got on and Mr. and Mrs. Russ were on it. Mr. Russ was the conductor. He took part of my fare and said, ""That's enough."" I had pennies. I remembered I had one Indian head penny, so I looked into my pennies and found a third of one Indian head penny. I took a good look at it. It was made of shiny copper. Mr. Russ asked me if I had any nickels. I found four nickels in my change, so I gave him them."
"0126"	"(02/11/51)"	"The boys were talking about a horse Spokane. Andy B. came over to where we came and asked if anyone knew if he won. Frank said he heard someone say he won and it paid 5 to 1. Ann and I were out celebrating and she was alone with the men and I was with the kids. I looked in the entries and I saw Spokane entered. He was mentioned once before. I aw some name with to wine."
"0127"	"(02/12/51)"	"I watched the boys play football. A snake came at me, but I got him. We put the weeds on fire and then put them out."
"0128"	"(02/14/51)"	"There was an atomic explosion. We ran under cover of some rocks. The rocks came down on our passage after the explosion and blocked us under the rocks, but there was enough air coming in. I used the butt of my gun and got out. I saw Sam squirting water into the air. I was on top of the hill and I saw the horizon lit up and when I looked, there was coke ovens in Fairchance and homes were on fire in Rivertown, PA."
"0129"	"(02/15/51)"	"I was down by the jail. Al. V. was sitting with the prisoners. He had about six months of a year served. The police were getting oranges to eat. The oranges were like grapefruits. Some had a reddish color and the passer said they were a cherry orange. I sat with a girl. I leaned on something and picked it up unintentional and it was the girl's wallet. She had two ten dollar bills wrapped around. The whistle blew and I looked at the clock and it was 11:15 a.m. and there was another clock with 11:25 a.m. I told the girls that the clocks were different. I looked at the 11:15 one and the large handle moved fast to 11:25 a.m. I watched as it moved. It was the time. I was getting my gun ready to go fox hunting by Joe Lucas. He had a farm way out in the wilds and the game was to be good. I looked at my shells and they seemed to be soggy and half full."
"0130"	"(02/16/51)"	"I was washing the windows on the house at 11 E. 68th St. I saw the antenna on our house and the red house. A carpenter was fixing he gutters. We moved in our old house. I looked at the kitchen floor and it was hardwood. The small strips. I noticed there was like tar between the strips. Then I looked into the dining room and the old softwood floors were there sanded down. I stepped back and a sliver came up. She picked it up. We had three beds. They were the old-fashioned steel bed. The kitchen door had a glass all the way down and we had a shade on the door. A fellow came in and ate with us. He said. ""Colbusie"" and something else in Slovenian, but didn't understand it. Ann was working. I walked thru the woodwork building."
"0131"	"(02/17/51)"	"I was driving my car thru thick traffic."
"0132"	"(02/18/51)"	"I was down close to the ground and there was a bee close to my face. One was in a hole. His rear was sticking out. I was in Fairchance, PA. I saw a train coming. When it passed, two cars with red hot coke went by and then another two. I was going across another crossing and the red signal flashed and he gates came down. I went back to wait for the train to come by. I met Pisto Jernick. I asked him if his sister was still around the neighborhood and he said she lived in Oliver and her two boys were men now. I sat in a restaurant. Mr. Stebner sat in a chair and the sun was shining on him. He moved away from it because it was to hot. I was in a restaurant and they had success on the menu. We had a little dog. We went up on the screen wire of our porch. We spun around the porch and the dog ran on the screen around like on the ground. George Lasko came over and put my electric lawn mower beside a tree and it started to burn the tree. I went on someone's porch and pulled the pipe out. A little dog tried to bite me, but I held him down with my hand. Then he turned out to be a little baby and was loving me up. I could see a glare flicker light on the horizon as though there was a fire over the hill."
"0133"	"(02/19/51)"	"I saw a couple of cows in a green cornfield and a horse. I ran for a tree because I thought the horses and cow would get mad and go for us. I climbed a tree. Walter went for a tree paper. I dug a ditch and put a water line in. I planted a small tree when it was in. It was a large tree. I put manure on the ground and it rained on it. I had a bulb that the light was dim from it."
"0134"	"(02/20/51)"	"Al Lasko was going to Russia as an American soldier. He marked a card and gave it to Ann in case they tried to hold him. One man had a shmoo and the shmoo talked to the people and they followed it to the American zone. Stalin was with Ann and me on a road. It was the boundary line between our country and his. His banks were high and ours low. I noticed in a  distance a stone cliff. The water started to gush out and seemed to be breaking the wall of rock down and came out in more and more volume. I could see Stalin's trick. He had that sabotaged and his banks were higher so that the water would overflow our land. Ann was nude in the clear water up to her neck. It was clear water. I pulled her out and then I saw her under water again, so I reached down and pulled her out. She was drying herself and I stood in front of her to shield her. I climbed over our shanty on 72nd St. and there was a string of barbed wire strung across it. I saw Ray Lasko. He had a long coat to his shoes and he was a little man. Then I saw a couple other small men with long coats. They were about as tall as our Bob."
"0135"	"(02/21/51)"	"I made some old scrap iron. I was going to sell it. Then I saw a large pile of scrap iron. A guy was coming by and he said iron was 5 cents a pound."
"0136"	"(02/22/51)"	"I asked two fellows the name of the two winners of first and second races today. He called and gave me the names. I was in a dark cave and was it dark. I could see only a little thru some cracks to daylight in the roof. I saw a big tall horse and a tall man leading him to the racetrack. I saw Tom Mix and his Tony. We hauled a racehorse in a trailer and we also carried one to the track. I saw female horses in a field. They were big and the horses were built like women. They were nude and did they have big rumps. The male horses were on our side. I saw a fellow chopping with a hatchet and he chopped into his foot several times. I could see that he chopped his foot up."
"0137"	"(02/23/51)"	"Gramp, Steve and I were lying on the ground sleeping. I awoke and looked up and saw a monstrous alligator coming our way with his big mouth open. I yelled at him, then a monkey came near him and they monkeyed around and I got my 22 pistol. I looked into the barrel and saw a small paper was there. I yelled at the animals, then shot once and the animals obeyed me. I noticed half of my barrel was shot off and was red hot from the paper wad being there. It was dark and overcastted from smoke and clouds in the daytime. I saw a big girl bowling and did she have the speed. There was a big boy exercising. He was spinning or whirling and he made himself turn into many smaller or little bodies and they did the same, all of them. I looked into Ernest's coke oven and it was burning and half of the oven was loaded, the other half was half coke and half coal. I heard a fellow yell Rock Rock. He was lying on the beach under sand. He got up because there were all kinds of frogs around them. There was a small boar attacking one of the men."
"0138"	"(02/25/51)"	"I was on radio or television for the White Sewing Machine Co. I was traveling in PA. I could see the hills in the distance. I thought I was near the mountains. I looked for them, but couldn't see them."
"0139"	"(02/26/51)"	"Barbara bought two colts for $24.50 and sold them for $225.00. She made a nice sum. I picked up a tire at the gas station which belonged to me. There were a couple of colored guys. I told them it was mine. I was in con's field hunting. A rabbit jumped and ran away from us. I was digging up the sidewalk and was doing to put in a new one. I talked with Joe Lasko and he told me I was the smartest one and was Ann's best boyfriend. He liked me the best of all. 72 came to me. I sat out in the fresh air and sunshine."
"0140"	"(02/26/51)"	"I was lying in bed and a neighbor said I looked so nice in bed. I told her I was relaxing and enjoying it. That's why I looked so good. Grandma came to me and Ann said, ""You two should go now if you want to steal the business from someone."" We had funny containers for our work. Ann Petrit's had us count her work for her. She also counted with us."
"0141"	"(02/28/51)"	"Grandma had a lot of cockroaches. They walked all over the floors. I went into a lighted room and they were even flying around, and I knocked them down with my hands. A small room was filled with them. They had their wings open and were mating. The room was lighted up bright and I could see the cockroaches mating with their wings spread."
"0142"	"(03/01/51)"	"I was cutting off bars on the hand machine. They were long ones. I saw a beautiful gray horse. Could he run. He was a young one. Loddie dug a hole in the ground. I was watching bees fly around the house and land on it. Nick Snider gave me a hair cut. Dominic had a tavern and I wanted to buy a bottle of wine from him."
"0143"	"(03/02/51)"	"I was walking thru a store and someone that knew me said, ""Evans, Evans,"" and I went up to them and jokingly said, ""Shoes."" I had a suit on that had fancy pocket decorations with a medal decoration. A fellow got off a truck and touched my pocket and said, ""What fancy pockets."" I was going to hit him, but noticed that he was just jesting and didn't mean any harm and I knew him. The 79th corner drugstore was vacant. The fellow was sitting and a load of steel beams. Joe Lasko was with me. He was ready to go to work and was staggering and swaying drunk. I was pitching a dead ball to the boys in the shop and they couldn't catch or judge it. I looked into a man's and lady's eyes. They were brown and black. I saw a sign and on it was Master Bid."
"0144"	"(03/03/51)"	"I saw a cow get bounced from a penna shanty toilet. She landed on the ground and there seemed to be something out of place, because she had her tongue out on one side of her mouth and she lay as though she was being strangled. I looked for my dad to fix her up. I called and Rogers came up and I gave him a bar and said, ""She is like this."" He motioned for me to go out of the cafeteria. I went into the hall and Ernie was talking with him. He said, ""They don't care anything about it."" He meant about the shop and its workers and wouldn't do anything. He gave me a handful of ground bars."
"0145"	"(03/04/51)"	"I was working in the shop and there was so little work to do. It looked like a layoff. Shripple said his bearing rubbed on his wheel. I took it off and he was going to pocket the bearing. It was an extra one and valuable one. I told him it would have to stay because the axle would go bad. I looked at the shaft and it was worn bad. I saw giant cigarettes. Someone told me I could take a lady home from work and drop her off at Breckville. Deep came to my vision."
"0146"	"(03/04/51)"	"Sweeney was what I heard a voice tell me when I heard Dugan's voice and I asked him to give me a winner. Ann and I were out riding at night and we were lost on the side and muddy streets. I flashed my headlights but couldn't see the streets so well. Dugan blabbed and I couldn't understand him. Then I heard young Sweeney and I thought it was false."
"0147"	"(03/06/51)"	"I saw Seventec. It was a woman standing in a show window among shoes. I saw a big man in bed. I saw a horse coming towards us. I was piloting an airplane. It was so simple. I saw a large plane take off and the pilot had it fly upside down as he walked on its surface."
"0148"	"(03/08/51)"	"I looked into the sky and could see trees on the clouds. Then I could see the green leaves on them. I told Bob Lippert to look and it turned out to be on the ground, beautiful green forest. A bull came out and I started to climb a tree. I got a job in graphite bronze and I went to the men's room. There were about 4 toilets and they were all full of shit."
"0149"	"(03/09/51)"	"I was driving at night and we came to a dead end and my car backed into the water. We waded it and Audrey went under water, but I got hold of her and Bob and held them up. Jack Lasko and I ran across the street to beat the oncoming traffic and a cop came after us. Jack started to run, but I didn't because I knew we would get caught for jaywalking. Jack stopped and the cop said $3 apiece, but let us go free after I told him our story. We surrendered to the cop."
"0150"	"(03/10/51)"	"I saw Joe Lasko. He was at our home and was pouring out whiskey. I saw my good old golden bull. I saw a freight car look like a skeleton. It had cutouts all over the sides. A fellow said it was to be built into a home and the holes were to be windows. Two men were fighting. One was getting the of it. The one put a mirror in front of his face and that seemed to take the fight out of him."
"0151"	"(03/11/51)"	"I came to the school door weeping and there were handkerchiefs hanging on the door. I walked into the hall and went into a room where there were all girls but one man. I made a sign of the cross, knelt beside the bed and started to pray when I noticed I had my hat on. A lady was monkeying with two lamps on the window sill and couldn't fix them right, so I got up and tried to adjust them, but had a hard time getting the shades right. Boys were playing ball in the schoolyard. I found a nickel with a hole in it. I saw a truck loaded with broken glass. I bought a flashlight. The button slid all the way down. It was a zipper. It opened up."
"0152"	"(03/12/51)"	"I was Superman. I did my damage to the subversive elements. Audrey got a white frost like on her nose, then all over. I used my power and it disappeared from her body. I flew at will and could not be seen by most subversive ones. Ann Rusnak's boy was running on all fours so fast I could hardly catch him. I was out hunting ducks. It was raining. Kuchera and I were coming home and we came to a high cliff. We went down and held on to bushes to keep from slipping down the hill."
"0153"	"(03/13/51)"	"A colored boy was playing with Audrey and I couldn't get rid of him. He always came back. I hit him with a stick; still he came back."
"0154"	"(03/14/51)"	"I got into a boat and the waves rocked me so much. I tried to paddle with my hands and couldn't do it. I touched bottom with my feet and got to shore. This water was supposed to be in Mary Lasko's basement. I saw a card where Grandpa was trying to get some kind of pension. He wanted $14 for lodge money. There were two wild horses. They ran for me. I ran away and flew out of the way. I accidentally dumped Mary Lasko's noodles into the sink water. I picked them out of the water to rinse off. I went to a couple of shoemakers to get a pair of shoes fixed and I finally come to one who fixed them."
"0155"	"(03/15/51)"	"I was in the basement cellar in 1103 E. 68 St. I pulled the loose rack from the floor and was that a nice high basement. I pulled some from near a support and it gave away. I ran upstairs and Grandma was there. The roof was falling down. I got hold of Gram's hand and the house seemed to be going underground. I got out and pulled Grandma out. The property went under, down. I heard a rumor that a Jew had a gorilla do that so the property would go down in price. Then he bought it cheap and what a magnificent building was put up. The place was inlaid floor, walls and ceiling all in blue. It was a long building a block long. It was to be a furniture store. A fellow came up with cap to sell me. I said I had hatless, don't need one. He said, ""I'll sell it for 25 cents. The store sells it for 20 cents, but I must make some extra money."" A bookie joint was raided and they hauled some glass on the street. Hank came up with my tire air gauge that I had 20 years ago and it had numbers on it. We had a garden of tomatoes. There were some plants where it was loaded with tiny bugs that were eating the plant. Two Jews were bidding for the property."
"0156"	"(03/16/51)"	"Hank Seegert said G.G. said Evans got 350 and 450 and 12.50 and 13.50. I had to sneak into the dairy and hide, then go to work with the men under false pretenses. G.G.'s home was located very near a railroad track and his wife was afraid the track would wash out some day and the train would run thru their home."
"0157"	"(03/17/51)"	"I looked at my leg and saw a blood clot in an artery start to move in the artery. I watched it move. At first I thought it was a good idea for it to free up and clear out of my system, but then I thought of it going to my heart and clogging it. The clot went moving. It came to a bend in the artery and it stopped there. My brother Steve got into an airplane and flew around. A blood clot was passing thru my arteries. I could see it move a lump."
"0158"	"(03/18/51)"	"I was standing and the waves came in on the lake. I saw the banks of the lake washed in. A string of freight cars ran into the lake. Then I saw the impossible. An engine was over the bank and he ran backwards up the bank and out of the water. There were cars, autos, they had tried to make the grade up out but couldn't. A lady slid down the bank, then she tried to climb out. I was on a farm in the fields. I had a steel nut in my hand. I wished to see a rabbit and I did. I threw the nut at him as he ran and missed. I hid in the tall grass. I had a club, stick. A kid who knew me came yelling, ""Get out of my farm boots. I see you."" He knew where I was. Two fellows and a lady came by us as we lay on the ground. We saw small bugs on the ground. The man stepped on him and he ran away. We said, ""You didn't get him."" I was riding a bicycle uphill with Hank on the rear. It was hard peddling, but I made it. Audrey jumped on a rock. It moved on the water, then turned into a yacht. Bob had the captain's cap on. I took it off his head, then I put it back on and let him be captain. He said, ""Plug up the holes,"" and the crew did it. Our TV was on a blink. I noticed tube no. 9 was the one."
"0159"	"(03/19/51)"	"I was driving G.G.'s car for him because he was not able at the time. Ann murdered someone and was trying to put the blame on me. Ann found a milk can that was sealed and I was sharpening a chisel on an emery wheel to even up the can. I went out into the street. It was dark and I was afraid of a holdup. I came to a boy and he reached into his pocket. I thought it was a gun, so I grabbed his hand and he had a small toy gun that shot a dart. I was driving at night, some car stopped on the right side of the road facing me and I had to run over the lawn to get by it. I drove and stopped near a theater. Boys were shoveling snow, so I gave them a hand with it. We were playing catch the apple like ball. I threw a long spear twice and it went a long distance. I was around my boyhood school."
"0160"	"(03/20/51)"	"Russ's dog bit me on the arm. The dogcatchers came for him and took him away. We walked thru mud. I had the hose and put water on the dog to keep him away. I saw a man murder about three policemen and a detective with a dagger. He was found with a black jack. I was going thru the colored section and there was one colored man bothering me till a champ of some kind of theirs came and he let me go. I flew with Bob. I was writing my names in my book and I saw a picture of a black horse in it. I heard Birdie and Convenient."
"0161"	"(03/21/51)"	"I was hitting out fly balls and could I hit them high. I saw Mr. Evans as a winner."
"0162"	"(03/22/51)"	"I was a milkman on G.G.'s route. Mrs. Dirdle was sitting in a chair nude and she said such and such horse would win today. The motor was idling long and the water started to boil."
"0163"	"(03/24/51)"	"I saw win paid 10.00, one ran 2nd paid 2.40."
"0164"	"(03/26/51)"	"I was running operating the b and s and I fell asleep when I awoke. It was dark and I was alone. I walked along the tracks, felt my way till I got to the light switch, then I put on some lights. I wondered if I should stay because one should not stay long. I put on a light in the telephone booth which I didn't know of. Robin Hood came to me when I was half asleep. I was helping a lady to operate on Bob. The sharp knife cut so easy. I had nerve to do it."
"0165"	"(03/27/51)"	"I picked up a large night frog. I saw holes in the ground that were animals' homes. We picked cherries."
"0166"	"(03/28/51)"	"I was swimming on shallow water on a board, then I made off I was swimming up a hill on asphalt road and I went up. An old lady and a girl fell into the lake. I took of my hat and waded in sand, saved the girl and the old lady. I was going to school again. I found a $150 two 50 cent pieces and a 25 cent piece. A boy owned a restaurant and this lay on the floor by the counter. I picked it up and threw a quarter on the counter for the boy. He gave Bob and me some grapes that were flat and red."
"0167"	"(03/29/51)"	"I saw some nice brown horses saddled up for a race. I saw Cecilia, she was dressed up and looked beautiful. I was operating brown and sharps. I helped some fellows drain water out of some drawers."
"0168"	"(03/30/51)"	"The creek was dug out deeper and the water ran the opposite direction. I ran a train part of the way on the side track. We were at Arendose's in Rivertown, PA."
"0169"	"(03/31/51)"	"I was in the paper the results. War II -- School master. Two I heard. I was flying around the ceiling in a high building. I could see my family below."
"0170"	"(04/01/51)"	"I picked up a handful of steel bars on 68th St. and when I put them down they were so long they stretched across the driveways, so I had to put them on the lawn."
"0171"	"(04/02/51)"	"I had a balloon tied to a party of my motor and the car rang. Ralph or Harold Schultz stole my pistol and was going to rob us, but I got the shotgun and shells and I and my family got near him. I pointed the shotgun at him and told him to surrender, but he wouldn't. He pointed the pistol at members of my family. I sneaked up closer till he got reckless and then I jumped him and took the gun away from him. I held him by one arm and he got tough with me. I punched him. When we arrived at his home, two policemen were waiting for him. They took him into custody. I was standing on a hill looking down about a half mile where my car was parked. The view was clear. I was chasing a ball. It fell into a creek and floated on top. I missed it as it came by, so I ran down the creek and caught it. The boss was looking for Lennie Delatt. I got my foot caught in a revolving sand paper belt and it cut thru my shoe. A lady came by and gave us some kind of candy that was attached to feathers."
"0172"	"(04/03/51)"	"Ernie, Bill, G.G. and I were laying brick with a machine. All you did was push it and a row of brick was laid. Bill and I went into a basement for a drink. I took a cup and he had glass. We came to a small statue, the Virgin Mary. I tipped the image and water poured out. I washed my hands and Bill said, ""Rusty water is coming out."" I tipped the image back and the water stopped and the image started to sing. The mouth opened as a human being. This seemed to be like an evil lair. I saw images and they planned to get me in their clutches. I was in their territory. I started to run and there were images in my way to block me, but I fought my way thru them into safe territory. I was in Rivertown. I looked at the coke ovens, which I left about 27 years ago, and I could see them so clear. There were a few new buildings by the ovens. I looked at Arenda's house and I looked at #155, our house. There was a beautiful girl standing by the window and she gave me a smile. I thought I left that town 27 years ago and I became nobody in all those years. I was sad. I had a rubber doll that had a beautiful figure. It was an image of the Blessed Mother. Ann was covered with a plastic cover that you could see thru and she was nude."
"0173"	"(04/04/51)"	"Up came to my mind. I was driving home in a small and was going up a hill fast. He passed other cars and a big man tried to stop it, but it knocked him over and kept on going. I was with some communists. They were eating a special food that I didn't like the looks of. I saw the rank Pizey. He lost weight from being on a diet. We were sleeping in his home."
"0174"	"(04/05/51)"	"I was working in this dairy. I looked at the time and said, ""I have a lot of time."""
"0175"	"(04/06/51)"	"A couple was killed by a storm and a tree fell on their sister. Jack Petritis was drunk and was coming over to our house at night. I ran to the door and locked it. We had a small peephole and he put his eye to the hole and I blew into his eye. I was walking over beds to get to a room in our house."
"0176"	"(04/07/51)"	"I saw Truman. He was a shoemaker fixing my shoes. He called me into his office and we had a chat. He did a dance for me. I saw small holes in a piece of steel where a pin went into and there was a name of a horse that shoemaker was to ride and win today."
"0177"	"(04/08/51)"	"Ann and I were watching water come out of the ground, a spring from rain water."
"0178"	"(04/08/51)"	"I had a dinner bucket and there were a lot of oranges in it. I think I saw Canasta as a horse. I went out to get a paper and I heard the newsboys say who won the big race. I can't remember it. I saw one of the boys with a newspaper of some kind. I asked him if it had the entries in it. He opened it up and there were none, so I said, ""I don't want it."""
"0179"	"(04/09/51)"	"Ann and I were driving thru a tunnel. We were about halfway thru when Ann said, ""Let's pray the our father for he will protect us from danger and let us know ahead of time."" When we got thru, we heard a real high wind blowing outside, so we stopped and went back for the exit outside. I looked back into the tunnel and I saw some dust blowing into the tunnel. As we got out, I hung on to Ann as we walked out into the open. The sidewalk was muddy. I was conscious that I was walking on the wrong side of her. I was closing the door and something would hold it back. I couldn't shut it. I pushed and I finally got it almost closed when I heard a voice say, ""This next one will be poison."" A small pup dog came in. I told the kids to keep their hands off him because he was to be poison. Audrey touched him, so I told her to go to the sink and wash her hands. The sink was full of dishes, so I had to move some of them out of the way and we both washed our hands."
"0180"	"(04/10/51)"	"Our cupboard was overloaded with dishes. They were handing out over the shelves. I took an old style kerosene lamp off the ladder and put it on the table. I saw a _______ in the night sky I saw stars. I saw faces of women and a man float thru the sky. The man had a mustache. I saw a number on a side of a clock. It was #3225. This sight frightened me. I was flying as Johnny Kolesar walked. There seemed to be a picnic in the woods. Kotnik threw something at me. I was above him. I threw fruit at him from the air and hit him. He ran away."
"0181"	"(04/11/51)"	"I went to cut myself a piece of ham and when I was scraping off the fat to cut it, the ham started to talk to me that it wanted to live. So it came to life again and it was Sophia Polander and she did recuperate from being baked and then to live again."
"0182"	"(04/12/51)"	"I was paying for an article in Sears. I paid it in silver money. I was counting it. Louie Clanker was going on a trip. He pulled out a row of big bills. He said he had about $3,000 with him. A half dollar rolled off the table and into my hand."
"0183"	"(04/13/51)"	"I was in Miami, FL. I thought of the weather. I looked at the sky and it was a misty day. The sun was dim. I thought, ""What a day."" I also thought a storm was brewing into a hurricane. I saw smoke blowing from a distance. I saw a red suburban street car. One of the old timers. It was big."
"0184"	"(04/14/51)"	"Ann and I had a beer and whiskey. Barbara and brother Mike were there. They took the beer. I told Ann, ""We won't have any meat today for a change because I am sick of it for a while."" I picked up a small object off the table and it was a marrow bone. I threw it on the floor for Trixie. I was down in a deep cut at the end of a railroad line. There were rail ties built up on the side which held the sides from falling in. I looked at the bumper on the car and thought what would happen if the car bumper hit the wall hard. Baby Pauly came to my mind when I was in bed relaxing."
"0185"	"(04/15/51)"	"A fellow said Uncle Miltie won and paid $15 and the Boot horse won and paid a bundle. I played #7374. Ann and I went to St. Andrew's Church. The pews were low steps like at a circus. We walked over them to the front one, then sat down in front. I was riding on some funny do-hicky. I balanced myself with a stick. Then I hopped along."
"0186"	"(04/15/51)"	"I was awake in our house in PA. I went downstairs to put the lights off and in the front room I heard noises. I put out the lights and looked in and saw spooks moving around. I threw objects right at them, but it didn't faze them. One was coming at me. I made a sign of the cross and he disappeared. I closed the door and it pounded on the door. I heard noises in the house that sounded like kids running down the steps. Jack Delatt came in. He told me of two horses, but I can't remember them. He then went to bed. The bulb (light) was thick that we had in the hallway. Ann and I went downtown. Trixie followed us. I watched a car spin and skid, then jumped the curb into the other lane and then the driver started to skid because he drove too fast. I was lost in the post office downtown. There were so many doors, I didn't know which one to go thru."
"0187"	"(04/17/51)"	"I was guessing names and I was close to being a winner of a grand prize. I had another list of names to guess and if I would guess them, I would win the grand prize. Ann and I were in the heights. I rode in the upper deck of the bus. I looked or saw up. I played ball with some kids, then I went wading in a clean pond of water. I could see fish swimming after my toes. I watched a lion sneaking up on Ann and I and we saw him. There was something of mine on the lawn and Ann went out for it. The lion kept sneaking up on her, then he made a leap on her and knocked her down. I climbed on a small tree and made a jump for the lion. He happened to move and I missed him. I ran and climbed the tree again and the lion came after me. He climbed the tree next to me. When he got up near me, I got hold of the tree he was on and spun it around with the lion on it. He got so dizzy, I knocked him off on the ground. He was laid out. I picked him up and broke his bones and the lion was dead. People came around and were astounded and happy that I killed the prowling lion. They said there was a $15,000 dollar reward for the lion, so I said, ""Well, I will get it."" Jean Helm was playing hide and seek. Julia Gibson was with Ann and I. She perked up her mouth, so I kissed her. There were two bulls watching me go over the fence. One was a black bull. He was anxious to come at me. I saw a birth of a baby boy. He talked, walked and did things like a 5-year-old. He put the light on by the switch."
"0188"	"(04/18/51)"	"I was flying fast and was afraid I would run into some electric or telephone wire as I came to them. I picked up a small girl and flew around with her. Wiatrack's car was burning on the rear end of the tank. I was driving it. We stopped by a water trough and I was going to put it out. When I wanted to stop it, I put on the emergency brake, but the car rolled downhill. I put on the brake pedal and it kept on rolling downhill and finally stopped. Kotnik was setting near a girl's legs and looking at them. I got close to the front of the car and there were small pin holes where the gas was squirting out. Bill and I went into the storage room. The place looked like a manure pile and Bill said it was bird shit. I saw some small springs and one large and very fine spring. A bull was chasing me. I flew and he flew after me. He got near me and I cocked my fist at him and he beat it. I was collecting money from the barber. I had a wheelbarrow full of money."
"0189"	"(04/19/51)"	"I looked into my pocket and it was full of money loaded with bills. A friend of mine was giving me tokens, passes and silver for streetcar and bus money. I saw a river that the water was forced into it. I watched it and the force and volume was terrific. The current was so swift in the river, I thought it couldn't make the bend in the river, but it went around it. A lady came to me and kissed me. I said, ""You better watch yourself because my wife is here."""
"0190"	"(04/20/51)"	"Ann and I went out to look for a suit for Bob. We were going to have him a tailor-made one."
"0191"	"(04/22/51)"	"Bob and I were walking with Father Lasko. We stopped at a home of someone and the lady gave us a meal."
"0192"	"(04/22/51)"	"I saw Beaverby which caught my mind. I was looking for something with beaver. Barbara had it written for me. She looked at the entries for me. I saw Bill Grove's list of horses. I remember he had chocolate."
"0193"	"(04/23/51)"	"I was dreaming I was eating butter and I awoke and was going to write butter for a horse. Ann and I were in bed and I noticed our door open. I got up and pushed brother Steve out. Hew as like a spook. I pushed him off the porch and he disappeared. I was driving on a rough road and was it rough. Then it turned narrow. I saw a male and female horse trying intimate. The male put down a young colt. Was he small. Hiney hung on to my legs as I flew so I came down slowly. I had a gun and we were playing shooting. I shot the air rifle and tried to shoot a horse, but the b-b didn't carry to him. Grandma drove my car and she didn't step on the brake to stop it. She just let it coast till it stopped. Mary started to yell at a lady she thought was Grandma and the neighbors laughed at her. A fellow Joe I know came towards me with a pint of whiskey. The bottle was large. When he got near, he looked at me thru the bottle and I could see his eyes."
"0194"	"(04/23/51)"	"I had a shovel and I was digging up the earth by ant piles and did the ants swarm around. I ran away from there so they wouldn't get on me, for they would sure bite."
"0195"	"(04/24/51)"	"I parked my car in a space in a shop like which was my folk's and my brother parked his beside mine. Charles Ch. and I were in the country. We were by a gate and it opened up. We fell and then jumped up for we thought what if a herd of bulls stampeded us. We looked into the field and sure enough, there were big bulls there. Charles said, ""What would you do if the bulls came after you?"" I said, I would fly into the air."" I flew up real high. When I looked down, it frightened me a little for it was really high. I dropped a little, then stopped myself in the air and flew around a little in the air. I went into the cafeteria to get some ice cream. There were people dressed, especially the 50-year men. Elmer was one of them. Kids were by the tables eating and there were two babies. I tried to make them smile because they were close and looking at me. I seemed to jump high into the air, then I started to come down and when I looked down, I really was high. I came down a ways, then about 100 feet up. I stopped in the air by outstretching my arms and flapped them a little. Then I like floated in the air and was I high."
"0196"	"(04/24/51)"	"I saw a name that had a D initial at the end."
"0197"	"(04/25/51)"	"Ann and I went to teacher's meeting. There was a colored boy. Ann's skirt was up when she was fixing her stocking and this colored boy always leaned forward close and looked at Ann's legs. I got mad and I hit him in the face. He got a black eye from that. Ann and I were greasing the, or oiling the bridge and I said, ""That black bastard, how he was looking at your legs."" And then I noticed a couple of colored men and they heard me. I knew they would come after me, so Ann and I went away. I opened up a can; there was oil in it. It was thick so I mixed or stirred it. The Laskos were looking for us. They walked by our fence and asked if Cutlers lived here, and I said no, but Evans lived here and they didn't know who we were. Cutler was dead lying there in the house. I picked up a large grape off a grape vine and ate it. Was it sweet. I was chasing a young girl. She was bashful and shy. I was riding a bicycle with Barbara thru Fairchance. There were ripe bananas hanging on trees. I did a stunt whirling in the air. There was a big, dead tree."
"0198"	"(04/27/51)"	"I was doing some kind of work that I did faster now than before. I heard Mr. Arendas was outside of the house talking to Grandma. When I got there, it was Uncle Jake. He came to see one of his kids who got hit on the side of the face from a firebrick by falling out of its place. Grandma was throwing up a leaf of cabbage and catching it. I had a fork of coke that I was taking outside from the house."
"0199"	"(04/29/51)"	"I had a dream. Someone came to me as I was in bed and said, ""You had 14 winners for a change."" I played some hookups. A fellow wanted a nickel. I said no and he was going to ruin my car. I yelled John, Joe to Steve and he ran away. I had a stolen tire on my spare. The lock didn't work so good. I was playing and always win back my money."
"0200"	"(04/30/51)"	"I was in bed and I heard escaping air. I went to the valve by the wall and the plug was out and the air was escaping. I put the plug in and the thread on the plug must have been stripped because it wouldn't tighten up and the air pressure would knock it out. I got some thread and was going to wind some on the plug so it would tighten up. Grandma was sleeping in bed and so was Grandpa. Bob got up and hid under the bed, but I saw him so I called him out. We were going to sleep in a coal shed. There were about three bulbs that were lit up. There was too much light, so I was going to put them out, but I noticed they were all by an electric switch and I would have to turn the bulb out to shut it off. A fellow gave me a push down a stairway. It was high. He made off as though he was falling, but his intention was to knock me down the steps and over the railing to a drop where I would kill myself. I got hold of a banister and stopped myself. I knew someone was after me, and sure enough, they threw poison bombs at me. I could smell the poison, but I kept going and then it seemed they were chasing another guy. One came around a building and I waited for him. I really gave it to him when he came around. I had him knocked out. I threw him around like a rag doll. He was a hillbilly and he had two babies. Ann looked at them and said, ""How old are they?"" and I said, ""The larger one is 4 years old."" ""I thought they were small for their age,"" she said. Then I saw a big fly on the baby's neck. It was as large as a queen bumblebee and it had a thick stinger on its mouth."
"0201"	"(05/01/51)"	"I was looking thru a hold of a bedroom. There was a stream of water running thru a large pipe. I told the party if it rained hard, the water would raise to the hole and water would come into his bedroom. I was trying to put down the window shade, but it would not stick, so I let it stay up."
"0202"	"(05/02/51)"	"Cattling duck came to my mind as I lay in bed. I was in the screw dept. It was dark in there. I slowly reached for the switch box and put the lights on. When the lights went on, I saw Kochera and Farmer working on the hand machines. I asked Farmer if he knew who was going to win the derby and he said yes, but he told me a number 276. A truck pulled up. I opened three doors, then I was in and there was a nice girl with her head resting on the driver's shoulder. I stuck my head in and she pursed her lips. I kissed her and again for it was like real sweet and mellow. I was riding a bicycle at night. It had a dim headlight. The peddling was hard."
"0203"	"(05/03/51)"	"I tore down some billboard signs and a sheriff saw me. He started to chase me. He was close to me and did I run. He was on my heels all the way, then he stopped and I got away. I ran away."
"0204"	"(05/04/51)"	"Sickle's image came to mind as I was awakening. I was playing ball. I ran and caught flies. I saw Muchunis's paper. He had about 3 horses that he played _, _, _. I don't remember the names. I saw Ekirs printed in large letters. I saw the moon. It seemed close. I could see the clouds float around it. I had a good look at it."
"0205"	"(05/05/51)"	"I was outside and the smoke from the city was blowing over Parma. I could smell the bad odor from it. I looked at the smoke as it floated over Parma. I was reading a book and I had to focus the distance to see it clear. Hank and I were taking our tools to do some kind of a job. A piece of paper flew out of my hand across the street, then the wind carried it back past me."
"0206"	"(05/06/51)"	"I saw excitable Mary and Clip, or it came to my mind when I was sleeping. Ernie and I went to Bill Beriner's home and he gave us a shot of whiskey."
"0207"	"(05/07/51)"	"Louie Kaufman and I were looking at a man's picture on the wall. He was dead and his name was Kingstone. Louie said he was working so hard that he died early from the speedy work. He was trying to beat everyone. Louie had his hand on my shoulder and we walked thru fields to work. We hopped over small puddles of water and saw frogs around ponds. Then we saw a big frog in the water. I never saw one so big. I got a twig and touched him, then he moved. We had to climb down a little cliff. I was to start working at a certain time. I always looked at the clock. Butler came to my mind, that he may be a winner in my dreams. I was in the screw dept. It got dark in there all at once, then the building trembled and rumbled. I ran out for I thought the building would fall apart."
"0208"	"(05/08/51)"	"Ray Kucera was getting married. I was an usher for him. A man was loading an automatic gun to shoot on the celebration. I had a red hankie that I blew my hose in and a kid remarked to me. Some girl insulted Anna and she didn't want to be a bridesmaid. I talked to her and she was a pop bottle. Louie Ohio furniture Store tried to sell us a hot water tank. It was rusty and was supposed to be new, not used yet. The groom was batting ball and I tried to catch one, but my judgment was bad and I couldn't get one. John Tesar was at the wedding and he had a squirt gun (water gun) and monkeyed with it as he does. I had a shawl I was to put around my neck, but I couldn't get it just right so that the white side would come on top. I found a lot of money in change, pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters."
"0209"	"(05/09/51)"	"I heard deep fen or blue fen. I saw a horse race where horses were chained and they pulled or pushed a freight steel car and the one that pushed it against the other won. One horse pushed it against about five or six horses. His chain broke and he ran as a winner. The steel freight car ran over most of the other horses and they lay there dying. One of the horses opened up a trap door and the dying horses fell into a hole of water, for I heard them scream as they fell, and when they landed, they were excited. The other horse closed the trap door. Frank wanted to borrow a half dollar from me to give it to another guy he talked to. I noticed it was on a horse bet that he lost. He then gave the guy about 4 or 5 dollars. I came by Gibson's door and called Lassie, but about 4 or 5 pups came out first, then Lassie. A freight train came by and the pups were on the other side of the track. I was afraid they would get killed, but when the freight passed, the pups were walking between the rails on the ties as the freight went over them with harm. I was eating a banana and standing in front of Gibson's screen door. I heard first. I watched the coke ovens smoke and did the smoke roll out of them. I went into a country church where there were benches of old wood to sit on. I saw Frank and Donnie there. I saw a bull in a field. I picked up a wet glove. We bought an old house and sold ours. I looked and saw a big man walking. He was in front of a skyscraper and seemed to be as tall as it."
"0210"	"(05/11/51)"	"I went up a stairway with Mickey. We stopped to see Bernie and when we got to his door, I saw steel chips in the cracks of the door. I looked over the top of the door and I saw the hallway was filled with chips all the way to the top of the door. His wife said she cleaned a half of a room. I told her she should walk on the unclean half, then clean the other half tomorrow. I had an oilcloth. I saw pynton or pyton on it. I got out of my car and it seemed morning. I looked at the white blossoms on trees. They were there, then would fade. I was out hunting rabbits. I shot at one and it turned out to be a dog. We shot at a bird and he flew into a hole, then came out and I grabbed him. I hit his head on a pipe and he gripped my hand with his claws. He held on tight till I bounded his head more, then he let go. I was driving on a rough road. I t was full of holes. A fellow had a cell flashlight and he shined it on the distant trees. I went into Tony Maroll's beer garden and I drank and talked with him."
"0211"	"(05/13/51)"	"Grandma had a little baby in her lap. She squeezed its nose and it would wiggle its nose. I squeezed it a little and said, ""Don't squeeze it like that."" I was way up north. I saw a string of pistols, rocket guns also for protection of our border. Dick Tracy went to sleep. I gave him a bell to swallow. He did and when he moved, the bell would ring. I saw a long fence that was lying down on the ground. It was old and dilapidated. Some boys built a fire near new homes and we bawled them out."
"0212"	"(05/14/51)"	"I looked at a selection and I saw Fireball Zack picked as a winner. A canary and spider were fighting. The spider got the canary dizzy and groggy. I broke them apart. Ann and I came home from work the same time. Sabruck was our insurance man again. He was in overalls. Bill Grove and I were in the Richman Bros. Co. looking at different machines and at flaws in leather and clothing. My large toenail was broken. I pulled it partly off and I noticed my small toe was like half squeezed flat on the side. I shook the rest of the nail and it was coming loose, so I left it alone."
"0213"	"(05/15/51)"	"I was by a large body of water. There was a rough water. The waves came over on shore and got us wet. Bob and Audrey."
"0214"	"(05/18/51)"	"I was picking up some firewood for Grandma. She was going to make a fire in the stove. I was trying to sneak up on a man by going under things, but he seemed to keep the same distance from me. I picked up a couple lemons and threw them at him. They broke and flew like buckshot and did he run. I looked thru the window at my television. I jumped over a fence very lightly. It was old wood. I looked up at some designs on a ceiling and they were red, white and blue. I thought of horses that color and I was flying high. G.G. and some big fat women were nude. He tried to intimate her, but she always pushed him off. Then he got mad. She had a big pair of legs. Then a woman came in and she had one large leg and a thin one. The husband of the fat woman came in as I was going out. Grandma had about seven beds and there was at least one person in each one. There was a nurse by Sister Mary. I said I would like to hug and kiss her. She came over. I put my arms around her and I hugged and kissed her. The first kiss was good, then I looked at her nose as she had a wart and a hook nose. I didn't like her kiss after that. I had a close look at her lips and face and lost interest in her."
"0215"	"(05/19/51)"	"When I awoke, I was lying and in my mind I saw deep fen."
"0216"	"(05/20/51)"	"Someone told me he was going to play Bob's birthday. He thought he would win next time. I was out locking the car and two couples came up to me and said, ""Do you know me?"" I looked at them and said no. They said they were hillbillies from PA.,  Eddie's friend. I said, ""Yes, I know him."" I was going into the house and Switcher had a light behind the garage and he was getting coal for the furnace. There was a coffee cover on the porch. I shook out the coffee grounds. I saw a little worm like or insects. A frog came up and took one into his mouth, but let it go. Ann and Bob wanted to step on a cricket, thinking it was a cockroach. Ann saw Doctor Allen. She touched some instrument he used on a man and she got the disease he had. I told her to get treatments for her nose also. I thought I had my shoes off, so I flew around."
"0217"	"(05/22/51)"	"Mary Matias told me a fellow played some hot ones today. She said one was a cherry. I said cherry path and she said yes, that was it. I was going to run for mayor or governor. I was going to vote. I got a cellophane and was to put my voting sheets in the bag. I looked for a seat to sit and I finally spotted one rocking chair in the corner. I sat into it. John Chipka came over to vote. I told the fellow, ""I know him, he's a friend."" ""I will give you a bookie,"" said the man. I said ok. I was riding over tracks. I saw so many tracks, I drove down a dirt road."
"0218"	"(05/22/51)"	"I was looking for Ann. She took a walk with a fellow I know to someone's home. I looked for her at night. I saw the two guys and they said they took her by some friend's house. They were kidding me till it dawned on me they were kidding me and she was right near me. Ann drove my car around the block without putting on the lights at night with the kids. Audrey ran up close to a train to throw a rock at it. It was so close, she leaned back and fell out of the way. The brakemen, firemen, train stopped and the crew came to me. I was spanking Audrey for doing it. Some of the fire crew took one spank at her rump for doing that with my permission. While I was laying in bed, I seemed to hear hollow boots."
"0219"	"(05/23/51)"	"The government had a crew cutting down trees. I looked up at some of the trees. They were high, big. Someone said they would cover 900 sq. ft. if they fell. I was in tall green grass. Bob ran to me in the deep grass. I was drinking. I was putting in pipes. I looked thru the woods where I used to hunt. There were houses, homes on the other side, but they were vacant."
"0220"	"(05/24/51)"	"I was watering the cooler pipes at the dairy and so was Bill Grove. Some girls hid from him. He turned the water valves open from a tank and the girls were hiding in there. They tried to push him out."
"0221"	"(05/25/51)"	"I worked in the dairy, with milk and water. Ann was drinking gin and whiskey out of a bottle with the boss. I was mad at her. Marie looked into my book and Ann took it away before she could see what I had written in it. Black came to my mind or my subconscious transferred it to my conscious mind."
"0222"	"(05/26/51)"	"I put some water in a dish and the rice turned into worms and crawled around. I saw a small bug on the wall. I tried to squash it, but couldn't. I came to the stove to shake off the clothes from bugs and the ants that ran around on the floor. I was running. I built a fire in a fireplace I had, then I put coal up it so the fire would last to do some cooking. I had a hose and I put the water on and did it squirt far."
"0223"	"(05/28/51)"	"Ann and I carried a work bench to a certain spot. Ann said her dad would have used it if he were alive. We walked down hill and had to watch for slipping. I was a star ball player and a fading star had a small man try to assassinate me. I caught the fellow with a box and I figured he had a gun in the box. He tried to aim at me, but I pushed the box aside and held him for the police to take him in. I saw a black swan roosting on the schoolhouse in Rivertown. It was night and there were a lot of colored people there. Loddie had a fancy looking cat instead of a dog as I called him. I was running away from the assassinator. A gang of guys came to Sue's house and they wanted to assassinate me because I knew who murdered a fellow who they brought in front of my door. I looked out and I saw the fellow lying on the sidewalk. I was teeing off golf balls. I knocked two at a good distance. Then I put on another and it was a flatstone."
"0224"	"(05/28/51)"	"I was in a    , fellows from whites, home and his mother was going to get married. He said jokingly that he would rape his mother, but she said he knows he was married for 3 months. I got some broken eggs in a container and spilled them around on the floor. Then she gave me a shot of whiskey. I wished her luck. She said, ""You have to kiss the bride,"" so I said, ""I must have another shot,"" and the floor and place where the glass was. It was sticky and slippery from the eggs. I was picking up drills by the handfuls. Some were glass drills. I was looking at used cars and Ernie Kolpin was driving a long car. Then I saw one. It seemed to be about a hundred feet long."
"0225"	"(05/30/51)"	"Charles Charvat and I were forced into a holdup of a company's funds out of a safe. We were inside and couldn't go out or away because we would be shot. My mother and other people were looking for us because we were late getting home. They were running. I was sneaking in them so they wouldn't spot me. I came to a berry bush and picked berries. I saw Grandpas Lasko. I called him and he came to me so close and then turned away and walked, but didn't say anything when I said, ""How are you?"" I could see his shadow around the corner as he went around it. The fellows from St. Clair were autographing theirs on a wall in Gordon Park. Hlabshe was the last one on these. I was by Gill Grove's home and she gave us the money we loaned her. It was about $28 or $29. I said, ""If you need it, keep it or part of it."" She said she had $5 and that was enough for her. Ann and I were praying and a priest came by and was happy and silent as we prayed. Then he told us of some dreaded disease that people get and what horrible pains they get. The priest was lighting candles and there was a statue of Christ that seemed to be partly burned away. He put the lighter on Christ's body and it began to smolder. The priest looked and touched the statue's chest and he was sort of frightened. Frank was there. He was going for some water, but the statue called him back. Then the lake water came in and up to where Christ's chest was burning and it was put out. Ann and I were sitting up above on a bank and watching it. Frank came to our house and alone."
"0226"	"(05/31/51)"	"I was in the army at war. We were mopping up the enemy without any interference at our main post. I saw a sign with a direction pointer. It said, ""To France."" I was walking thru the brush. I saw a wild animal like a cat or tiger. I stopped and picked up a stick. The animal started to walk away slowly. I gave out a loud roar and the animal disappeared. A fellow in the other direction heard my roar and got scared and ran near a store or building and told a man what he heard. The man got an air rifle and shot in my direction. He hit my shoe, so I yelled at him and walked towards him. When I got there, a couple of men said, ""There are a couple hot babes there."" I looked and I saw two old women with men's working gloves on. I walked up steps and a fellow playfully jumped on my back. Then I saw another one jump for me. I ducked and grabbed him by the arm as he missed my back and landed on the steps. I was wanted downstairs, so I started down and I ducked again and a fellow went over my head down the steps. I slid or glided down the steps. I beat a lion with a baseball bat."
"0227"	"(06/02/51)"	"Audrey had pennies. I picked a shiny penny out of her hand and looked at it closely. It had a series of 1780 or something of that sort. It had crinkles and was shiny."
"0228"	"(06/03/51)"	"I was dozing when Louie came up to me and said, ""Look out the window."" Irene told me to kiss her, so I grabbed her and did she squeeze me and held on. I walked thru the house, which was big, with my old oily working shoes. I mopped up the floor. I was looking at refrigerators. A man wanted me to work on them. I saw 00 on a ticket. The 00 showed plain and the rest was almost erased. Allen Ruis was small. He was sitting on the ground. A dog came up and licked his face. He was frightened. I could see it on his face. I yelled at the dog and we went away."
"0229"	"(06/04/51)"	"I was driving up hill and the car wouldn't make it till I found a trick how to give it the gas. I was standing in a ditch in a little water. I was thinking of getting out of school in a week's time. We gave our money for another house and changed our minds about getting out of ours."
"0230"	"(06/05/51)"	"I bought a new home and the walls seemed to be built out of line. I noticed the other homes were being rebuilt or repaired on account of the uneven walls. I got down close to the ground and took a good look at the foundation bricks. I sighted the walls from one end to another. I was standing on a pile where there was a little fire. Thee were rags on it also. Gramp was below. I threw down some paper for him to start a fire. We were like on a mountain top. I was trying to write a theme or poem in the cafeteria in white. Ann was lying on the pile sleeping like in a bed. I looked at the time in New York and it was 5:45 and my watch was 7:00 p.m. That was Big City time. I went to see Dr. Allen. I found him at a party. The nurse was boiling potatoes; then she made rice. Dr. Allen was eating some. Dr. Allen checked me, and he made a diagram of some organ."
"0231"	"(06/06/51)"	"It was either night or misty. I seemed to go up into the air. It gave me a thrill. I was up high or it seemed so. In my sleep I thought of two high horses. Ann, the kids, myself and George Lasko were walking along a swift river bank. Then George waded across and I went about halfway across and I yelled to Ann to watch the kids so they wouldn't fall into the river. The water was deep in some spots. I grabbed Audrey by the arm and she had a good size arm. Ann cleaned out one of our rooms and it was like a dance hall. I jigged or danced a few steps on the floor myself. Ann put too much coal into a stove and the pipe got red hot and the walls caught fire. I was picking up coins, pennies and a dime that was coated. I had long underwear on. I was filling a pail with water and it ran out on the bottom because there was a hole there. I looked thru a glass at some woven material."
"0232"	"(06/07/51)"	"I was dragging a fire hose and said the hose was most important and the chief said, ""Your brain is most important."" There was a fire in a building and the chief called us. He said the hose was most important because what we need is water. We were walking along deep grass with rifles and chasing out snakes and frogs from the grass. Ernie said his older son Ernie eloped with another woman."
"0233"	"(06/08/51)"	"We were at war with the Japanese and I was a soldier. The Japanese were close to our home. I went on guard near the front in a building and you couldn't tell a Japanese from an ordinary man. I stuck up a man with a broom, which was to be my gun. He pulled out a pistol. I looked out the back window and there I saw the Japanese soldiers. I ran out the back way and got home at night. I was in a beer garden. It was loaded with Japanese. I waited by the bar and the Japanese bartender was talking to the Japanese and then I walked out. I saw Kucera out near the door. I motioned for him to come outside. I was going to tell him about the Japanese. We were captured by the Japanese and were going to be executed. They were going to let a baby go, but we two and a white woman were to get executed, but before the Japanese could do that we were rescued and freed by the Americans."
"0234"	"(06/09/51)"	"Charles Charvat was taking down a neon sign and was going to change the lettering on it for Sears Roebuck and Co. I got the bill for my car and it was $53 and some cents. There was a flood in our house. I opened up the water drain and the water rushed down the ditch to a dam we built. It was filling up fast. There were kids on the dam. I yelled at them to get off. I was afraid it would break before they got off, but it didn't. Us grownups went on the dam, then I yelled, ""Everybody get off because it is going to break."" I could feel the dam giving a little. Just as we got of,f the dam gave way and the flood started. I saw the water go around a telephone operator. She was going to run away, but then picked up her phone as did the telephone operator in the Johnstown flood. Uncle Mike was visiting us. He was by Sue's place and I heard them say Sue gave him a dollar once in a while."
"0235"	"(06/10/51)"	"I was by Andy Palider's place. He was building a crib of some kind and I looked at the screws he put on. They were shined up or polished by himself. I saw a coin on the ground. Mrs. Lenacic picked it up and then threw it down. I told Audrey to pick it up and give it to me. It was a half dollar and the bibbit between it to hold it together was too thick and it made the half dollar too thick and no one wanted it in trade."
"0236"	"(06/10/51)"	"I squeezed a priest by the neck and let him go and he fell over dead. I was a fugitive from justice. I was afraid to tell anyone and I thought of losing my soul. They couldn't do anything to me because they couldn't find the body."
"0237"	"(06/10/51)"	"A lady was singing and I was next to her. She wanted me to sing, so I hummed it because I didn't know the words. Some boys were singing Scotch songs and I tapped with my feet to time it. I bought some bananas and there were a lot of soft ones. I was putting on some scotch tape with another fellow. It was a large size. Mother's rupture opened up and she urinated thru it and more intestines started to come out, so I stopped it."
"0238"	"(06/12/51)"	"Steve and I were carrying dead people. Steve and I saw a wagon pull up with a large family of kids. I was climbing down a ledge, which was steep. I looked into an old birdhouse and there were nude birds mounted and grass growing thru the box. I saw ruins of an old house. The rocks were hot. A fire was still brewing. It was a spooky night."
"0239"	"(06/12/51)"	"It was night and kind of dark and Ann fixed it up for me to draw two ovens out. I thought of the darkness and the wheeling of the coke on the car. We hid Grandpa's will or something and I was angry at him for foiling me on his inheritance. I was coming over to Steve to tell him of Grandpa."
"0240"	"(06/13/51)"	"I got my pay and the man counted the cash and paid me after I signed my name on the pay voucher. It was wet and I had to sign way above the line. I signed John Evans. I was afraid someone would rob me, so I hid behind some rocks and I saw like a shadow behind others. I finally counted it. I had leather belts and it was stamped on the belt 21.00 and there were holes in the belt and by each hole there was so much cash per hole stamped on the belt. I saw myself being robbed by Biblical time. I saw a motor that pushed a drill in and out about 12 inches. There was a long, thin drill on it and I put it near Tesar's face and it went up and down near his face. Ann and I took a ride on a streetcar."
"0241"	"(06/14/51)"	"I dumped brass screws from two containers into one. Colored boys were throwing at windows. Mrs. Rudis gave me some kind of badge or trinket for my birthday present."
"0242"	"(06/17/51)"	"Bob and I were dressed for hunting. He had a gun also. I noticed he had galoshes on so I sent him into the house to put on boots. It was dark night and we were going to hunt."
"0243"	"(06/18/51)"	"Ann and I drew out or robbed the Parma Bank. The police were mad at the people for calling them silly names. A policewoman came to our house and I said, ""What do you want?"" and she said, ""I want to talk to your old lady."" I said, ""Okay."" Old lady, I'll tell her. So I told Ann and said, ""Watch what you say to her."" I was driving a bus. We made a dam and then it broke and the water ran down the creek full force. We met Ronnie by the creek further on and he said the creek ran full for a while. It was snowing and I said, ""The 18th of June and a snow fall. It looks as though it will snow all summer"". Marie snubbed me twice, then her husband talked to me. He was a friend of mine. They had a boy baby. His name was Johnnie. Some horse I was looking for, someone said he was running above the border. Audrey, Bob and I were on the bed and Barbara was shaking pepper on us. It made us sneeze. She did that twice."
"0244"	"(06/19/51)"	"There was a lot of snow on the ground and it was hard driving. My car didn't want to start, but it finally did. I dumped some beans and small piece of butter on the ground out of a kettle. The girls were going to have dinner. They were preparing it. I threw three pairs of socks into the stove because my sister Mary cut the tops off when she was to cut off the labels only. Floating in the air, I was doing some stunts for the dinner party in the sunshine. Barbara got hold of my legs and pulled me down always, so I hit her on her legs till she let me alone. I went into the clothes closet that we had in PA. and took a good look into it. It was larger and there were a lot of clothes hanging in there. I had on two sets of clothes on myself. At first I just had a gym shirt on, not dressed properly."
"0245"	"(06/20/51)"	"There were a few marrow bones in a dish. There were large piles of cinders or rubbish piled up on a hill like. I found a small stick in the pile of cinders. There was snow on the ground."
"0246"	"(06/22/51)"	"Andy had his family come for a visit from Canada. When the government found out, they gave them maid service while they were here. Then all at once a cop came in and a cop of the olden days. It was Mr. Lasko. He was nervous and shaky. They got the orders to go home to Canada. They had to awake the kids early in the morning. It was still dark. When they were leaving, Grandpa Lasko ran over and kissed the man goodbye and then he ran over to the lady and kissed her goodbye. I was watching him from a lower level. As he walked, he was sort of shaky and walked like Charles Chaplin. Then he would stop and shake nervously. I was eating meat and I saw the fish bowl beer glasses they served. Ann got married to another man and still I was her husband. It was confusing. She got a postal card. It stated she would be home shortly."
"0247"	"(06/23/51)"	"Ann and I ran for I saw dark clouds and the rain was on its way and it finally came down on us. I had an extra large hat above my head. We ran home and crawled into bed and Andy Palider was watching us. Someone was masquerading in a Santa Claus outfit. A fellow held up a red headpiece he found in a barrel."
"0248"	"(06/25/51)"	"I looked into the clothes closet and I had water pipes and valves there. The water was leaking quite a bit from one of the valves. I pushed a plunger down into the socket and it stopped quite a bit. I looked into one of the electric sockets and there was a phosphorus light or like a burning electric on some parts of it, so I turned off the switch. There seemed to be a short circuit. Ann and I were stepping across large rocks and it was on the edges of them. I looked down on the rocks and told Ann to watch her step."
"0249"	"(06/26/51)"	"I picked up a green pair of shoes and I noticed another pair on the floor in the old house on St. Clair. I watched a girl wipe up the floor. I could see her legs."
"0250"	"(06/26/51)"	"I had a basket and I was near a baseball game. I heard Bob Feller hit the ball and I could hear the ball whiz by me. I looked up and kids were standing near a boy batting. He told them to get out of the way before he hit them."
"0251"	"(06/17/51)"	"I had a rifle in my hands. I took a good aim at an object high in the sky. I ran down a stairway with G.G. and some of the steps were narrow. I pointed the gun, then aimed it at an object."
"0252"	"(06/28/51)"	"On going to bet, Sun Umber came to me as a voice."
"0253"	"(06/29/51)"	"I saw results paper. Water 14.90. John Tesar saw a car go by. He wrote the license number down on a piece of paper and was letting me know he was getting a hot tip. He wrote on the truck speed 10 mi. per hr. in Parma. Uncle Joe came into our kitchen. All he had on was underwear. I knew he was dead and I got the jitters. He walked over to Grandpa and bumped him with his rear twice. Grandpa just looked surprised. Audrey slapped Uncle Joe on the shoulder quite hard. Joe made a face as of pain, then he slapped Audrey real hard on her rear. She cried because it hurt. I walked with Joe and looked back. Grandpa walked off the porch and watched us in amazement. I was trying to fix a water leak in a pump."
"0254"	"(06/30/51)"	"We had rifles and were pointing them at one another. I shot into the air. I found three double barrel shotguns in the snow covered up. John Warzel came to the screw dept. to talk to Eddie and me and was his face red."
"0255"	"(07/01/51)"	"I saw the clouds from a storm out in towards Big City hanging down to the earth like a tornado. I ran for home to tell my family to hide in the basement. I saw fleet factor in paper. The elevator I ran went up and down fast. I had a hard time stopping it on the floor I wanted it. Joe Kassimere was always having trouble with his brother. He always wanted to fight. I climbed on a shanty and said I would keep the fox or wolf away from me. I had a broomstick in my hand and intended to keep the animal away or knock it off the shanty."
"0256"	"(07/04/51)"	"I was drawing coke. I saw boys play ball. One small boy was batting the ball."
"0257"	"(07/06/51)"	"I was operating b and s; the spindle would stop every once in a while and make a bad one. I took the tool out and was grinding it. It was lunchtime and everyone went to eat. We were in PA on a visit. We were in bed. Bob got up to take a pee. Rose Lasko was looking at me. I could see her eyes and face. I went hunting with Wiatrack. The shells were ragged and went into the chamber kind of tight. We walked thru the weeds and grass, but couldn't see any game. I carried something to the shop in a tablespoon. I was late. Walter Demo was small. I told him what a shrimp he was. He was as small as my Bob."
"0258"	"(07/07/51)"	"I was killing snakes. I chopped off their heads. I saw a fat one and it was a rattler. His rattles were held high. I saw Ann Fox and Mr. D. I was working in the dairy and I mixed some concrete. I started up a motor and two of them started up in place of one."
"0259"	"(07/08/51)"	"I concentrated in my dream and French fleet came to me and a house was thought of. Someone took my pan from my work and put a cardboard box there. Bindas was going to pick out some names from cards. He dealt me cards and when I was going to look at them, most of them were cellophane. I was walking around with only a shirt on. You could see my penis and I was ashamed for I knew people were looking at me. I brought an extension light from one part of the basement on 68th Street and put it in another part. One of them paid 13 to 1. John Bindas had a new suit of clothes. I took a good look at it. I ran my finger on it and it was so fine I could see the pimples on his leg thru the pants. I was looking for my belongings in his house. I moved the long extension cord again. I took my key out of his door. His wife walked in with two dolls, a boy and girl. I kidded him that he now had a boy and girl. I jokingly talked to the dolls and to my surprise they talked back to me. They were the image of human beings. The girl said Charley Petritus was buried today."
"0260"	"(07/09/51)"	"I saw a young fellow lying dead on a slab. A young girl came to dance. I watched her. She danced around him, then she stepped on his body. She danced on his chest, stomach and groin. All at once the dead man opened up his eyes. He seemed to come out of a dream. He smiled and started to talk, then he took the girl into his arms and made love to her. I was looking into the entries and I saw image."
"0261"	"(07/11/51)"	"I saw there was a name of a horse. I played 3 horses and two of them came in. I forgot the names. I was in school listening to recitations. I was going to sit in a seat, but a colored boy sat there and I went to the back row. There was a deep drop there in back of the last row and I was careful not to fall off. Someone asked me who I played. I said Hoosier Boy."
"0262"	"(07/13/51)"	"It was snowing. I picked up some of the snowflakes in my hand. Audrey was throwing a dagger at me. I told her if she did that again, I would send her to reform school. I was driving and my car started to roll backwards downgrade. I applied my foot and emergency brake and it wouldn't stop. I ran over the curb stone on the lawn. I came to a stone wall. It had a brick gate and a man opened it and let me thru. I looked thru a skylight and saw an airplane. I carried a 22 pistol in my pocket. I was a sort of detective."
"0263"	"(07/14/51)"	"I saw a boy on a large bicycle or something of the kind and was he speeding on the road."
"0264"	"(07/16/51)"	"I saw Joe Faders and another fellow. They were up high on a scaffold and there were nude women about 75 ft. below them. The men were nude and Joe was pushing against one about 10"" long. Hilts and the other guy had short one. A wall I was driving downtown and all at once there was deep snow. I was stuck and it was about three feet deep. There were paths just about a foot wide for people to walk thru. I saw a bulldozer come thru and clear the snow."
"0265"	"(07/17/151)"	"A fellow showed us a piece of gold he held in his hand. Another man tried to force him to let him know where the gold was, but he wouldn't tell. I saw an object jumping or bouncing on the sidewalk, then it bounced over the bank. I had an idea it was under the sidewalk where the bouncing object was, so I dug under the sidewalk and came to some bricks and they were made like a vault. So I took the bricks off and I saw wax paper rolled in like dynamite sticks and there were fuses stuck in them. I found the treasure before I could open up the sticks. They started to sizzle and I threw some in different directions, then it dawned on me to pull out the fuses, so I did. I was supposed to have found a recipe in the treasure chest. I looked on the sidewalk and there carved in it was Johnny. I looked at it. Our small baby had some kind of rash, pimples all over its body. I called for a doctor and I couldn't think of his name. I held the phone for a long time, then gave up. Ann went to the doctor and he held her in his lap as he examined her. I saw a lot of school pupils get off a train when it stopped just so they wouldn't have to pay their fare. I saw my brother. I told him I was sorry for what happened to him. He was small as our Bob and was sort of sad."
"0266"	"(07/18/51)"	"I saw two men jump off a high cliff so they would own their homes in a better home as they were going down feet first. Then one turned and landed on his side. I could see the blood come out on the ground as they landed dead. The other one, as he jumped, his feet hit the side of the cliff and he landed on his side and also was killed. I said, ""I'm going to live in my simple house and am not going to jump."" I came over to George Gotches. He was going to bed. I drove two spikes into broom handle sticks and he was going to sleep. I moved the spikes over to make room for me. The brothers and sisters of George were small like I used to see them when I was a kid. Grandma had a baby lying in bed sleeping. The baby was lying in water that it was submerged under. Its nose would come above and it would breathe. A rowdy Slovak boy came into a building and got tough. I went after him. He ran away, but his gang got up and I had to clean up some of them. I later found the rowdy and I collared him. He was afraid. I punched him in the nose and then I saw people sitting around and there was some kind of liquid going thru tubes and thru them. We had a large schoolroom. The paper was hanging loose and I got hold of a long strip and it was loose. Martha O. was walking up the stairs and there was a caster on the step and I told her to watch herself."
"0267"	"(07/19/51)"	"Surprise in the paper. Kochera was taking out their stock and selling it to the Hobby House and the guy told him it was all scrap so he stopped it. He was stealing. I saw a miniature or illustration of a race. It was an image of a train."
"0268"	"(05/03/53)"	"I awoke and was saying, ""Mucho Mas"". It just seemed to come to me and I kept on repeating it."
"0269"	"(05/05/53)"	"I was watching boys play ball. I walked by a couple catching boys and one threw a ball at me. It got by me and I went for it. There were two girls, sisters. They had funny turned-up noses. As I was reaching for the ball, one of the girls, barefoot, tried to put her foot on the ball. Her foot was like one of these clowns, big and flatfoot. I pushed her foot off my hand and was it ugly. Her sister stuck her long, thin fingers after the ball and then pulled them away. I said she has six fingers or was it toes on hand or foot. Joe and Bill were playing golf. I went down into a big hole. I saw two balls. They were new. I hid one or covered it under the sand with my foot and I threw the other ball up high when one of the fellows came for it. Then I uncovered the other ball and put it into my pocket and intended to give it to Bob. A fellow was riding or walking with me. He insulted my wife. I got angry and was going to hit the fellow, but I changed my mind and told him how wrong he was by doing such a thing that he was sorry. I saw a streak thru the sky and it seemed to run down into the earth. Then a fire started and people were running towards it to see what happened. It was frightening. There was a stream of water running near the fire. It went into the earth."
"0270"	"(05/06/53)"	"I was explaining to a fellow how coke was made. I went into the boiler room with him and there I saw a big piece of coke. I touched it and said, ""Here is a real genuine piece of coke."" I was walking in snow. I tried to get on the road and had a hard time finding a low spot in the snow bank to get thru."
"0271"	"(05/08/53)"	"I was putting down a small payment in a couple dimes and I saw Indian head pennies. I picked them up and one was 1883 series and 360 series. The pennies were like new. I took them for my collection. My car didn't have the pep and I was angry. I was working on a drill press. I saw Whitey Volker and another man I knew."
"0272"	"(05/10/53)"	"I was in Rivertown. I went up Swaney's hill and I looked to see if any of the big trees were still up, but there was none of the old scenery. There was one tree. It was partly uprooted and I noticed it was pruned of its big branches. I looked at the trunk and wondered if the trunks were larger just because I was small and it seemed that way to me."
"0273"	"(05/11/53)"	"I was thinking if I should buy a new buick and cancel my Plymouth order and I heard ""Don't"" as an answer."
"0274"	"(05/12/53)"	"I was driving my car at night and I came on top of a hill and I noticed I was lost. It was a strange street and seemed like a strange town. I was loving my wife Ann in the garden. I drove my car and steering didn't seem to work, so I ran into a tree. I went to talk to Charlie and Andy, and Joe came in and gave me a stare that I am always loafing, so I told him I was working all the time he was away and just came here. I watched fellow down the pins and glasses were about 6 ft. away. The boys threw the balls thru the air and would get one pin at a time."
"0275"	"(05/13/53)"	"We fell asleep, Ray, Wiatrak and I, in the bowling alley. I heard something come into the room. It was dark and night. I got outside and I waited for Ray and Wiatrak to come out and they were still in there, so I opened the door and yelled in for them, but there was no answer. I started for home. I flew along in the pitch dark. I couldn't see. Then I could make out the path and I flew low along it. The moon came out and we had a moon night. I came near Pleasant Valley Road and ridge. I tried to fly again, but couldn't take off. Then Ann was with me and a couple brought a couple of pillows for us. I floated down slowly on the pillow. I was working in the dairy. We were going to take out a big pipeline and the water was draining out into the ditch. So we got a pump and were going to hook it up to drain the water out of the ditch."
"0276"	"(05/13/53)"	"I dreamed of a winner and it kept on repeating the dream. I forgot what it was."
"0277"	"(05/14/53)"	"I saw moke or moka as a winner. I was driving my car at night. I made a turn and it didn't stop. I thought I would hit something, but I missed it. Then the car started to back up and I stepped on the brake and it went down a side street and it wouldn't stop. Then finally it did."
"0278"	"(05/15/53)"	"I was out in the country on a farm. I came to a small cherry tree and there were some black ripe cherries on the tree. I picked them. My sisters pulled down the branch roughly and I yelled at them to let it go, so they wouldn't break it. I looked into a tree and I saw a snake's head, a large one, and a big branch. I told everyone to go away and stay away. I would go into the house for my rifle. I came in and got some shells and brother Steve started to go where the snake was. I yelled at him, but he wouldn't heed me. I got angry at him and bawled him out. Someone knocked down what I thought was the snake and it was a piece of steel. I looked up at the sky and a bird was flying over. I pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot. On top of the barn were three different kind of lights from years back. I looked towards the city of Big City and way out in the distance I could see a cloud of smoke where the city was. I was in Akron at the races, but I don't remember any of the horses or winners. I was by Rudis and we got on a streetcar, rather Audrey, and I asked the conductor if it went to a certain place and he said no. I told him to tell Audrey to get off. He started out and made one stop that I could see and Audrey didn't get off. I was excited. I asked Rudis to go with me to catch the streetcar to get Audrey. And she said it would be two hours before the car would reach the end of the line. I heard two Johnnies won."
"0279"	"(05/16/53)"	"We were by Marie Lasko's. We were on a high platform and Ann grabbed me and started to dance. I made her sit down before we fell off. George came home and I looked at him. He had a small face. George was chasing me in a car and I flew up and he couldn't catch me. Ann talked with Marie and she used foul language. I was nude and forgot where I left my pants. I was pretty hot looking for the opposite sex. I was picking up pins from an object and was handing it to Marie Lasko. I looked at a hold in the ground and there was a post and a chain on it to swing down. When I got hold of the chain, the post was loose and ready to topple over."
"0280"	"(05/17/53)"	"One of my children found Grandpa's money and he had 4 million dollars. I was going to play a horse $50 on the nose. I had one. I was sure he would win. I asked Ann and she said, ""Go ahead."" So I changed my mind and was going to play 25 an 25 on him. I forgot the name of the horse when I awoke."
"0281"	"(05/17/53)"	"We were traveling seeing sights. I drove my car on piers or boats and I paid 25 cents to take my car. One of my tires seemed to be off the rim. I tried to get it on and had a hard time doing it. Then there was a stranger's car on a rack. His one tire was off the rim, so I gave the car a little start backwards and forced the tire as it moved and the tire went on the rim. The car went backwards and I sort of held it back so it wouldn't hit another and, and it just bumped the other car a little."
"0282"	"(05/17/53)"	"I was in the city and I could smell the smoke and see it. We lived there again. I was sitting on the ground and I moved over and touched some shit that was near with my hand. Boy did it stink. I got some of it on my hand. I looked out the window and I noticed a house that was burned, was on fire again. I gave a child a broken bottle. I touched the sharp edges, then took away the piece I gave her for fear she would cut herself."
"0283"	"(05/18/53)"	"I was in a field with Barbara and Audrey. I looked up and saw rain coming and it was close. I got hold of Audrey and Barbara, picked them up and ran for home with them. This was in Rivertown. I was loving Ann. We were walking at night and someone started to whistle. We knew someone was there, so we turned around and I saw a dog coming our way. I thought it was a spook. I made a sign of a cross and he just went by us paying no attention to us. I saw a rabbit run under a porch. We went hunting and when we got to the field, it dawned on me we had no guns or hunting clothes. I was in Rivertown. I parked by Belches and I noticed my lights were blinkers and my car started to move down the grade. I got in and stopped it. Then I parked it near the store and a level grade."
"0284"	"(05/20/53)"	"I went back to 1100 E. 68 St. We were to move back there. Ann had to put her washer upstairs instead of in the basement because that was for Princer's washer. He was the landlord. I went upstairs and Poline was sitting on a chair. I helped her off and raised a trap door and the toilet was there. She stood there as I pulled down my pants and pulled out a plug of flesh from my rectum and held it in my hand. I didn't seem to be embarrassed. I picked her dress from the rear, then from the front and I could see it all. She had filthy underclothes as I did that I looked up and her two children were coming down the stairs. John Tesar shot 4 people. He said, ""I'm going to give myself up. I killed 4 people."" I noticed he had a gun holster around his neck and a small pistol in the holster. I razzed him what did he do with that, shoot flies? Then he told me a tall story how the bullet would travel miles by the wind changing its course. We had a sort of party. Someone passed shot glasses, then we drank and I had an awful tasting highball in mine. Steve, Mike and I were shopping on Superior Ave. We had an express wagon and it was loaded, so the food was falling off."
"0285"	"(05/21/53)"	"I was flying above the road about 3 ft. Then I flew up as high as the trees and I flew leisurely. I looked at a home. The lights were on and I could see the occupants within. I had a brick or a block of wood in my hand. I was going to throw it at a window and break it, but my conscience told me not to, so I flew by. I came to a river. Then I awoke. I was putting gas into my car and when I took out the nozzle, the vapor from the gas as it oozed out was so thick, it made a steam like and I was a little excited because I was afraid it might ignite and blow up. I was by Hilts and the phone rang 3 rings, then stopped. I picked the receiver up and said, ""Hello."" I heard a voice and couldn't make out who it was or whom they wanted."
"0286"	"(05/22/53)"	"I saw a lady dancing in the nude without a stitch of clothing on, then a young gentleman joined her. He was nude also. He danced and so did she like the natives do. He had very small sex organs just like a boy of 5 or 6 years old. I was watching them dance. It seemed to be on TV, then again it seemed to be in Rivertown, PA in my boyhood town behind the cow barns."
"0287"	"(05/22/53)"	"I dreamed I could honk like a big swan and I seemed to honk a little better than they could. One came in to challenge me to a fight. I was sort of backward of the jab of the swans' bills, but I took the chance and when he made a lunge at me, I would get him with the sole of my shoe on the bill. He made a few lunges at me and I always got him. Then he got mad and took a good start and made a lunge at me and I caught him with my shoe again. Then he tried another big start, but he changed his mind as he came close and saw I was ready for him. He turned away and finally surrendered. I was the winner. So the swans lined up and honked for stray swans to come in out of the dark. I was driving up a long hill. Someone was ahead of me and I tried to catch them, but they got ahead of me and thru the green light. Ann and I were taking a stroll. I told Barbara I was going to play stroll and she said not to. Then changed her mind and said, ""Okay, you can if you want to,"" It was night and Ann and I went into the house. I locked the doors. We went to a place where Andy Palider had a big hole dug and the boys had a cave dug into solid rock. Ann said, ""Why didn't they make the cave higher?"" and I said it was high enough. The arch they shaped it to was to strengthen it from a cave-in."
"0288"	"(05/23/53)"	"My car started to back up and I put on the brake pedal and it kept on going, then finally stopped."
"0289"	"(05/24/53)"	"Ann and I came home at night. I hooked up the water pipes and ran water thru the hose off the dresser. Then I shut it off and went for the kitchen door to see that it was locked. I was walking thru deep snow about 6 inches and Carter was walking. I said, ""Did you play Mucho Mas?"" and he said he played him $5 across the board. It was supposed to be a Nash horse. We walked across the border from Canada to USA and Eleanor Roosevelt was standing on the USA side and watched us come to our homeland. I got change from a colored man. He gave me about 8 pennies and two of them were Indian head pennies."
"0290"	"(05/25/53)"	"I was out hunting. I saw a rabbit run jump into the water. I could see where he was swimming under water by the disturbing water. I shot at him into the water and I seemed to have missed for he swam underwater further. I aimed again and shot when I went to pick him up. All there was is a pile of fir and a hole thru it in the middle. I had a line of machines I didn't like. Bill G. ran $41 and it wouldn't run off the motor's drive. He put on the belt to the counter shaft to see if it would run as it did when there was not motor drive. Someone was to come and fix the machine and there was a sort of magical meeting before two mystery men came in. I dreamed I saw Vance and Denny at the Boy Scout camp and it was like thru TV or from a distance, and I was shadow shooting at them like boys do with the empty hand and pointing a finger for the gun. I was either thinking in my sleep or I saw an entry in a small field race and the horse had the last pp and was to be a winner like my Sir Walter R. was."
"0291"	"(05/26/53)"	"I was playing baseball in Rivertown with the boys. I saw a pig running on a tree branch and came down. I got away from him and climbed a tree. The first thing I knew I was on top of the tree and the branches were few and when I looked down, I seemed to be up about 500 ft. I was up high and was a little nervous from the height. I looked down and saw the pig running around on the ground trying to pick up my scent. I thought of lying out from height and was a little afraid. Then I saw a picture of a young lady and I sort of let myself down and I couldn't see how I was coming down, but I sort of floated to the ground. I came into a classroom and the students were to write something on paper. I didn't know what because I was out at the time of the lecture. I played with Bob. I would sort of make a dive at him like Superman. I got hold of a little girl's hand and Bob's and I said, ""Let's run."" They ran and I had my feet in a running position and I floated across the room with them. I was loving my Ann. I pulled her on top of me and intimated her. My organ was very large at the time. In my sleep I heard a distant train whistle blow. This reminded me of my brother's death. I always seemed to get the chills or it seemed to me the distant train whistle was from the far beyond. I was going to a White's picnic."
"0292"	"(05/27/53)"	"I saw Memory of Deamland in the paper as a winner. I looked at the paper and I saw St. Benedictine High football champs of 1952 and 4 years back basketball. Bob, Barbara and I were going to live in a cave for a while during the winter. We traveled thru snow and finally came to the cave and there was a puny woman there. I asked her how long she would stay, and she said, ""Maybe till tonight if my husband shows up."""
"0293"	"(05/28/53)"	"We were at war and expected to be invaded any moment."
"0294"	"(05/29/53)"	"Grandpa, Bob and I were going to Herman Marolt's wedding. We parked the car and were waiting for a streetcar. It was night and we let one go by us and watched it go down the track. Something broke on my car and I was to charge it up to Marolt. I looked in on the selections and picked some winners, but I forgot the names when I awoke."
"0295"	"(05/30/53)"	"Ann had a horse named Progress on a sheet. She was to play. She wrote ""run"" in front of him. The phone no. 17?? was the one she was to call in to. I had one picked and gave Ann the name and she was to play 5 on it, but I can't remember the name. We had a little blonde boy baby. I told Ann, ""Now we have 2 boys and 2 girls."" I was at Tom Lasko's home. Ed was talking of buying a 21 inch tv. They had small trees in the house and it was hard to get by them. You had to brush by them to walk thru the room. Bob was playing ball with a board for a bat. I said, ""I'll find you one,"" and I found some old bats on some dump. One of them fell apart when I tapped it. I was driving my car over tracks. I met Peter Arendas and I talked to him and asked how he worked and said ""Days, afternoons, and nights."" I was looking at the race entries and then I looked at the time and it was 1:45 p.m. I said, ""I must hurry because I start work at 2 p.m."" Then it dawned on me I was not working that day. I saw the results in the paper. A man shot another man. His wife took the money and ran with it. The murderer then shot her. I was watching this. He spotted me and wanted to get rid of all witnesses, so I started to run between buildings and he tried to get a bead on me. I was afraid when I was running that he would shoot me also. I came to a lit up store. I ran into the place and told the occupants that they should call the police because a man and woman were shot on the hill. I then went for a window to get out the back way so the murderer would not see me come out. A boy came to me as I was going out the window and said, ""The police don't believe you."" I said, ""They'll find out. I'm going out."" There was a pink in my dream. I can't remember what it might have been, a pink horse. I was talking to Kucera and he does a lot of giggling and we were imitating his giggle. I came by Margaret. I put my hand around her hand and pulled her close to me with same. She was short, about 4 ft. tall."
"0296"	"(05/31/53)"	"I shot someone in the back to get his beer garden from him. I didn't kill him, but he had me in a nervous condition. I would get hammered every time I met him. Ray Kucera was my sympathizer. We were always drinking whiskey. Then I flew up and got away from my torturer. We stopped and I had a couple of wines. I heard Audrey yelling. I ran to see what was going on and Barbara was doing something to Audrey. I yelled at Barbara to stop it and she didn't heed me. I opened a locked gate and ran to her."
"0297"	"(06/01/53)"	"I took my family and a miniature train and I ran it. We went around a circle and I kept on blowing the whistle. I was sleeping in bed. We were living in our old home on 68th Street. Mr. O'Korn was digging up his lawn. I was working on the coke yard, drawing coke, and I didn't like it. Then I was on the coal shanty shoveling off coal into the yard. Jimmy Clear was digging up the tree lawn. He came to a pipe and pushed it over with a crowbar and a fine stream of water came up. He called me to come up. I said, disgusted, ""I'm not the landlord here and I have to fix it."" Ann was nude and Grandpa was coming down the stairs. I yelled at him to stop for a while, but he came on into the room and I said, ""Turn around and don't look,"" but he looked anyway. Ann just turned her back and he walked by. I found money, about $2 in half and quarter dollars."
"0298"	"(06/02/53)"	"I was sleeping on a bed. John Tesar came in and crawled in with me. I girl came in and I said, ""You have a nice face."" She just smiled. I went on the porch and that's where I said I slept on the hard floor without a pillow. A man gave me his coat. It was leather on both sides. He said it was mammal skin. All at once I see captured elephants being led. Steve (brother) and I ran up and scrambled up a hill. It was a small peak about 200 ft. in diameter and there was a drop of about 20 ft. This is what, we were safe from the elephants. I got up and heard the elephants coming around. I got up just in time. I was in Africa. I was on a different hill. I saw wild beasts roaming the jungle. I saw a lion coming our way. I pointed at him as though I was going to shoot at him, but I had no gun. He kept on coming closer, so I ran off the ridge to the other ridge to find a hiding place from the wild animals. The whole gang came after me and the lion followed. I knew he would find us, so I thought of getting away. I sort of jumped over some horses and started to fly away. I flew by people who were riding on horseback. It was the way of travel there. I was flying downhill and I had to sort of hold my flying back so I wouldn't go too fast. I saw a man lying on the ground. He was wounded or something. A girl came up with a pair of shears and cut off a lock of his golden hair, and another girl came and took off more hair. The man who was administering to the fallen man saw this, so he took the shears and cut the rest of the hair off and put them near and the girl and she picked them up and held them in her hands. These two hills seemed to be rocky. I saw it in the paper or it came to me in my sleep, what a nurse."
"0299"	"(06/03/53)"	"I was making a bet at a bookie. I played the 4th and 5th races and I won in the fifth. The horse paid $15 and I had 2 and 1 on the winner. I came home and there was a man sitting there. He was to have bawled out my wife and seemed to be a distant relative of hers. I started to bawl him out and I laid down the law to him. I told him if he opened up his mouth again I would throw him out on his ear. I threatened him and I was angry. Then there was a woman there later and I threatened her also. I bawled her out like I did the man. I picked up my overcoat and was going to hang it up and it split on the collar from old and weakness of material. I went down to Gordon Park and there were streams of water overflowing and running down the ditches and brooks. The water was heavy and high after a storm. Then later it came down to normal. We went swimming. A girl took a dive and she hit a wall with her head and was under water dazed and going deeper. I jumped in and got hold of her and brought her on top. The water was deep, up to my nose. I waded and took the girl ashore. I saved her life. I was swimming upstream, floating like, and I was going fast by my easy strokes. I dreamed the horse I played in the fifth won, and he did."
"0300"	"(06/04/53)"	"Charley C. and I were watching a cow's rear end as she would pucker up her holes. Then they would open and the waste matter would come out. The holes seemed to be very big and she seemed to have more than two. At the shop the company had coats and pants furnished for us. I was working at the Richman Brother's clothes. My machines were down and I had other things to do that I couldn't finish them. Someone made dough for bunchakee. I picked it up and put on the floor. I drove my car and the choke came out of the dashboard, and I didn't have lights and it was dark. I couldn't find my clothes. There were old ones. I looked at a high pair of shoes or boots that were there. I helped to sweep the floor and then I went home. Our two children were sick and Ann said I looked at them. Our baby lay looking at me and I smiled at it and it smiled at me."
"0301"	"(06/05/53)"	"I heard Clyde Beatty was dead and was buried under where cars drove or under a road. I was a captive in the Japanese army. One Japanese tried to pick or flip the guard's gun off the floor and he was bayoneted thru the heart. He still came to me and wished me goodbye, shook hands with me before he would die and said, ""You will be killed also."" Ann was kidnapped and people would not believe that she was held a prisoner when we got a break and got away from the captor. I was walking in front with Ann and my sister Sue and Mary were behind us with guns. I had an automatic pistol in my hand, which was in my pocket. I was also a captive."
"0302"	"(06/06/53)"	"It was night. I got up and noticed a light on in the basement. It was a short circuit in the wire. I separated the fine strips of wire and the short stopped. The copper wire was like new. A lady was testing something and all at once I saw wire curling out of her testing cord and it ran along the floor and outside. I saw foul play, so I put my foot on it and stopped it. I knew someone who was responsible would show up and I would capture him. I see a man and woman come my way. I walked towards them and they pull out guns and stick me up. I get the guns from them easily and turn them on them. I made them march forward and we came right into the hands of the police. I told them, ""Here's your party you're looking for."" I handed the police the guns and they took in the man and woman. I knew the brains of the gang would get after me for having part of his henchmen locked up. He seemed to be a genius, but a crooked one. I flew up to the top of a building and watched him below. I then came in front of him and his henchman had a tommy gun. The genius yelled to his henchman to get me, but I grabbed the genius and held him in front of me and he couldn't shoot me. I commanded the gun fly out of his hand and it did. He was so surprised that he stood there spellbound. The genius was surprised, so he sort of gave up the idea. I talked to him and said, ""You are a wise and smart man. You want to make money, a lot of it. You can with your ability and you do it legitimately. There's no sense in being crooked about it, and if you need any help, call on me and I will help you."" I asked him his name and he said John. I said, ""We are a couple of Johns."" I said, ""I am like Superman. I cannot be shot, bullets do not penetrate me and I can fly."" We stood up on a hill. A man was rolling garbage can lids down the hill. I commanded that the lids stop on the way down and they did. Then I commanded they roll back up the hill and they did. A man standing near me was surprised how I could command objects to obey. I was master over the genius and he knew it."
"0303"	"(06/08/53)"	"I was back in the city. I looked for a place to park and the signs were all 1 hr. parking and I wanted to park all day. I was on a big boat. It was loaded with coal. We were going up the river and I somehow was forcing the boat to go fast. All at once the coal ignited and we had to jump off the boat. I was fixing something in the house. Delatt and I were in a house fixing some repair job. The man came home from work and he knew Delatt. His wife said, ""We are Booth,"" and I said, ""I am Evans."" My brother (deceased) Joe was alive, living with us. He had bad teeth and I told him to get them fixed up. When I went to sleep, I seemed to see a big girl coming towards me. I was looking at the time and it was 2:10."
"0304"	"(06/09/53)"	"Someone hit the ball and it rolled into the water. I went in after it and got it. It was under water and I had to look for it."
"0305"	"(06/10/53)"	"I was on my farm. I told my company as I stood by a small waterfall, a brook ran thru my farm. I was going to build an ice swimming hole there. I was in school or was to learn something and I was putting it off and I knew the more I put it off, the further I got away from it."
"0306"	"(06/11/53)"	"I was on the porch with someone and Ann and Pauline Hydrlica (deceased) were walking into our yard. Pauline was looking at me as she walked by. She was smiling and I noticed she must have had her nose fixed for she was not bad looking then. Again she passed me on the street and she smiled again and her smile was nice and so was her face. I was by Grandma's. They decorated their house and were varnishing the paper. I had returns on the races, but I forgot the names of the winners. A few days back I had a dream where I saw or heard the word ""radio."""
"0307"	"(06/12/53)"	"Joe Bacon played Essakno or Essemonetta, some name like it, and it was a winner and paid $79. I was driving along the highway and found a spot where to park and I went to see a fellow who owned a lot of property to hunt on it, but he wouldn't give me the satisfaction of ownership. I went for a stroll and when I came back, I met the owner and I told a little fellow that the owner thought I was a gangster I was on Broadway Ave. I walked up to 72 St., then started to walk to the north and there was a big horse following me as I went along. I didn't like it because I was a little afraid of him. I was in the city."
"0308"	"(06/13/53)"	"I shut the door in Carter's house and the wall started to crumble. I went into the room and Mrs. Carter Sr. knocked down a chair or something and the burning coals fell on the floor. I was out at night driving and the car turned out to be a buggy. A truck like the one we have for rubbish in the shop came by. I hitchhiked and the boys stopped and picked Audrey and me up. The truck was full of boys smaller than Audrey. Ann and I wet to bed and we left a night light on. I stood by a closed closet door and it opened up by itself and gave me a start. I thought of spooks. I made the sign of the cross and it closed, then opened and closed again and again at the sign of the cross or motion of my hand. Ann was driving a car. I looked at the steering wheel and noticed it was not mine. I said, ""You are using Carter's car."" When we drove by Carter's, they said, ""We saw you drive away with the car."" Ann cried and I said, ""You are lucky you didn't get shot."" I went to the bookie and a girl said, ""You have a winner hooked."""
"0309"	"(06/14/53)"	"I saw men get stabbed in the back and blood oozed out. Hank was one of them. A fellow had a turtle. It wouldn't walk for him. I said, ""Put a fire under him and he will pull out his head."" I lit a match and put it under the turtle. He came out and did he run and was he big. I had a hard time keeping up with him. I was in the old neighborhood. We were driving to church to St. Francis on Superior Ave. I was driving thru the street. There were a lot of people walking thru. I stopped my car and got out. Then I walked for the car and it was a baby buggy. That's what my car turned into again. We went into church and it was full of people. I was home. I had a compass. I held the compass in my hand to see it point north. I picked up an air rifle that belonged to me. It seemed small compared to what it was when I was a kid. I thought I would shoot it. I saw a robin on a tree nearby. I was tempted to shoot him. I aimed, but didn't shoot."
"0310"	"(06/15/53)"	"I was driving my car down a hill. There was snow on the ground. It stalled by Elyria garage and I let it park in front of the door, blocking it. I had to go to work, so I left it there. After work I came there and didn't see the car. I went into the garage and it was there. I told Joe to fix it. When he opened the trunk door, the trunk was full of ashes. He told me to take out the ashes, so I got a shovel and went to work. He showed me the rusted body with holes in it."
"0311"	"(06/16/53)"	"I was supposed to be a doctor. A lady patient was down on the operating table. I had a sharp knife. I stuck the knife into the woman's chest, in deep towards the heart and pushed up the knife, sort of ripping the body open. The woman was awake when I did that, then she would sort of feel the pain. I would give the knife to the other doctor and he would do the rest of the operating. There was another patient and I did the same for her. A couple of young fellows who were not sure of our ability were following us around and this made me nervous. I saw a lot of bread nearby."
"0312"	"(06/17/53)"	"I was working and I could see the steel bushings in my sleep."
"0313"	"(06/18/53)"	"I was a fugitive. I was hiding near a farm. I raised my head and looked to see if my pursuer was coming my way. He saw my head as I raised up, so he started to run for me. I ran into a field and started to climb up on a wall. He ran and jumped up, touching my feet, trying to pull me down. I was up high, about 30 or 40 ft. up and he still kept on running back and would touch my feet and try to knock me loose. The wall was like a soft clay. I dug my hands and feet into it and go up step by step. I finally got up so high he could reach me. I was afraid to fall, for it was high. He would land on his feet as he dropped down. I was a fugitive on another occasion. I fooled my pursuers and was with them, but my son Bob was hiding near and they spotted him. He ran back and forth and they couldn't catch him. Joe Bagdon had his white dairy outfit on. He tried to catch Bob, but couldn't. We were like out in the wilderness. I was driving Carter's car. I stopped on a hill and it rolled back. I put on the brake, both of them, and still it rolled back. I finally worked the pedal and pulled up the emergency brake and it stopped. I drove it into a dead end. As I was making a turn, I bumped into an old farm gate. I told Carter, ""You drive your car. I might wreck it."" We stopped by the house and I went into the house because I had long underwear on and that's all. I came into the house and some fur-bearing animal was rubbing against me. I reach down and it was a big black dog. I tried to push him away, but he seemed to hold my hands."
"0314"	"(06/18/53)"	"I was playing some horses and I was giving my bets money to a fellow to take in. I think one horse was corncutter or corn. I am not sure now that I am awake. I noticed a nut missing off a bolt. I replaced it and tightened the bolt."
"0315"	"(06/19/53)"	"I was praying the rosary. I was to give the rosary back to Grandma's. She told me to put it on the cupboard. I flew to the cupboard. A big horse was standing there ready to run after me. The rosary turned into a prayer book. I was going to show this horse how I could fly. I worked my hands, but flew very slow and the horse laughed at me. I said, ""You just wait till I get a start and then you can try to catch me."" Someone had a new refrigerator outside among some boulders, rocks. I was driving along a road, then a train came and held back some traffic and I got into the traffic lane alongside the train. I was swinging on a swing with Vance. Sister Mary and Ann were going in swimming. They put their clothes on beach and small kids were playing and filling them with sand. So they put them in the water to float around. Someone gave me a handful of _ dollars in silver said this was mine on a bet. I saw a half dollar on the ground, then I saw a lot of nickels which I picked. There was a cat around Trixie. I shooed it away and it growled like a dog. I went by and I turned around and the cat intimated Trixie."
"0316"	"(06/20/53)"	"We had strawberries, blackberries in our house. They were growing and some were large and getting ripe. I saw Grandpa with a roll of bills, money. He went to a car to pay off someone and a small truck came by. I was in the garage a little way off and I saw Grandpa put up his hands and walk to the truck. I knew it was a holdup. I yelled, but the truck took off and sped away. I lost him by the time I got gone with my car. A bunch of kids ran towards my car. One kid ran in front of my car and I bumped and knocked him over, but he wasn't hurt. Grandma was doing dishes. I left a pile of money on the table. I went to the sink and I saw my money mixed with. I picked up a bag opened it and found a nice bunch of bananas in it. I took it out and bawled Grandma out for not watching what she picks up and throws into the sink. I walked thru the streets up one and I saw 3rd street one #3115. A colored man brought in a load of big bar stock steel. He parked way back and I had to lug the big bars about 75 feet and slide them on a pile. I was reaming some finished stock pieces. They were larger than my fist. I saw one with a slot thru the side. I showed it to Carter and said, ""I don't think I did that."" The reamer does not put slots on the side. We were on a hill and someone started a smoke signal down below. The smoke came up like with force. I was watching a daredevil diver. He seemed to dive anyway, including just a feet-first dive and it was about 200 ft. high. A colored fellow came off his truck. It was near the lakeshore. He went into the water where the white people were swimming and he dove and he would swim. He was walking to shore and he turned out to be a colored lady. She had her breasts uncovered. I looked at them and her nipples were like a pair of colored lips. I had a steel bar about 5/8 inch thick and 12 ft. long. A small hawk flew down from the sky and was coming at me. I tried to hit him with the bar, but he was too close to me and the bar was long."
"0317"	"(06/21/53)"	"I was watching an old man swinging by one arm. Then he walked on a fence to show how. Agile he was at his age. As he walked, he made a slip and fell off the fence. I said to his daughter, ""See how easy he could have broken his neck or arm by showing off. Carter was with us. There were a couple of Japanese whom were going to show us a stunt that was really a good one. Ann was bedridden. She got up and limped on one leg. I felt so sorry for her because I loved her and didn't want to lose her."
"0318"	"(06/21/53)"	"I am not sure, but I think I was flying in my sleep. I was working in the woodwork dept."
"0319"	"(06/22/53)"	"We had a wild tiger locked in our house. He ran around within roaring and trying to get out. I was going to St. Andrew's church with Ann. We met our old priest. I met a couple and the man introduced me to her and motioned to me she was a fruit. Then they told me they were booking and getting 14 cents on a dollar. I gave Carter and a couple of friends a look at a card I had from the couple. We were sitting in a pose to take pictures. I had a hat on, then I took it off and brushed my hair and did I have a nice head of hair."
"0320"	"(06/24/53)"	"I was flying around a house. A lady tried to catch me. I first ran, then flew up and watched her from the top of one side of the house. Then I took Bob and flew up high and I came down and up in a dive-bomber style like I flew fast. I touched a young girl's sex organs and it was a male instead of a girl. It got hard for him. Then he touched my sex organs and it was so sensitive that I had to push his hand away and he always came close to me and did it to me. I saw large black walnuts on the ground. A big truck was coming down the road, which was narrow. The big wheel and tires sunk into the mud and the mud pushed towards me. I moved to the edge of the road. We were sitting on a boat and funny bugs and salamander like things moved by. The boat was on land. A big savage of some kind came by and pushed our boat into the water and started to row us out. His enemies came along the shore and they were throwing objects at us. I held onto Bob. I was afraid we would overturn and Bob would drown because he couldn't swim. I was half asleep and I heard loudly Beachhead. I was looking for a farm. I went to Rivertown. I met Mike Farina. I was going up a hill to get one at a small store. One of my friends was to be a rebel so I got a pail of dirty water and said, ""So you want to be a rebel,"" and I gave him water as he came at me. He finally gave up, then Kogler said he was going to be a rebel. I threw some water under a door where Kogler was putting on the rebel clothes."
"0321"	"(06/25/53)"	"Something went wrong with my old car on the right rear wheel. I was by Fred's garage. We put the wheel on and let the jack down and the wheel, then bent to one side like it was a broken axle. I said jt was a broken axle. Fred said he didn't think so. When the axle was taken off, a big, flat bushing of brass was cracked. I said I would buy a new part. He said, ""You can solder it."" I said it wouldn't hole. He said he would. He did some kind of filing and it got hot. He said there was a liquid solder that would hold. A lady ran across the street and bought some solder. I opened up the bottle and Fred wanted to pour some liquid on the cracks and Fred squeezed the cracks together, then when he let go, it came apart again. I said, ""I told you it wouldn't hold."" There seemed to be an atomic interference in Big City. I saw a man in a window. Another man outside gave him two cans to hold and he tried to hold the two cans while the man tried to pull the cans apart. He pulled the man out thru the window and dragged him along, trying to pull the cans apart."
"0322"	"(06/27/53)"	"I was home. The phone rang. I answered it and a man's voice said, ""I have your daughter Barbara here and if you don't send your wife here, I will have to dispose of your daughter and you will never see her again."" That was a threatening call. I answered, ""My wife will not go because I will not let her. I love her too much and I also love my daughter as much, but if you harm her, you will never get away with this because in the end God will get and punish you."" Then I hung up and was a tortured soul. In a couple of hours Barbara came home. The man let her go after he found out how I reacted to his call. I told Barbara, ""Now I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer truthfully."" I said, ""Barbara, this man picked you up by asking you if you were going his way and you took the ride. That's how he abducted you."" And she said, ""Yes, you are right."" ""Now Barbara, haven't I told you never let a strange man pick you up?"" She said when he abducted her that your mother didn't come back as she promised and this was one way I would get her here, but it failed because of your dad. I didn't get an explanation on why your mother didn't come back idea."
"0323"	"(06/28/53)"	"I was helping to install some kind of big machinery. I had a big oil can and I forced oil into the machine. It came out thru the other side. Carter was with me. He said Joe Grabar had a gift of gab and I know he has. I walked to another part of the department. I t was dark. I heard someone make noise in the locker end of the department and I knew someone was sleeping. To my surprise, I saw Hilts walk out."
"0324"	"(06/29/53)"	"I was in a bedroom. Aunt Marie came my way. I walked towards her and she kissed me and she hung on. It was pretty good. We walked into a room where Bob was sleeping. Someone yelled, ""Fire!"" and Marie ran up to Bob and jerked him out of bed yelling fire. She frightened Bob. I said, ""Take it easy,"" so she let him go. I told Bob Marie was excited, that's why she yelled. I said to take it easy. I will take you there, no hurry. I picked him up and he stood up on the floor nude. I wound a blanket around him and then I awoke Audrey and I took them downstairs. It was a hotel or apartment we were in. I heard bells ringing like a phone. I was dreaming I saw or was watching war. I saw a soldier throw a bomb in front of an engine and it was a dud. It didn't go off. I was throwing glass on top of a 3 or 4 story building. Some of it wouldn't reach and came back down and broke."
"0325"	"(06/30/53)"	"I was imagining of intimating Rose C. and Ann asked what I was thinking, and I told her I had a secret impulse on Rose. She didn't like my attitude and I didn't blame her. Bobby was walking on the street and he fell into a manhole. I ran to his rescue and there were some people in the manhole whom were controlling it and they said I would have to wait when it was Bob's turn. They would get him out. Ann lay nude on the bed. I said, ""Cover up, someone might walk in."""
"0326"	"(06/30/53)"	"Audrey, Bob and I were climbing up a stairway up a mountain. We heard a noise and wanted to investigate. We finally came to a library. Nuns were taking care of it. I looked out into the mountains. We were on top of one ridge. I was looking into a magazine. I saw pictures of a pugilist. He had on a striped suit and his nostrils were large. I was in the house. Barbara had an artificial breast of a woman stuck on a cellophane paper. The wind blew hard and blew the nipple inside out and it was sticking inside the house. Barbara got frightened and ran away from the window. Grandma Evans got hold of the cellophane paper and ripped it off the window, leaving a hole where the cellophane was. Bob and I were watching traffic. We sat near the road and a fellow on a motorcycle almost ran over us. We moved further back from the road."
"0327"	"(07/01/53)"	"Russia took over our country and they started to work on us, making slaves of us and taking away everything. Grandpa was prisoner, was to be executed in three weeks. I went out and I noticed I was followed (shadowed). I thought I would get around a corner and fly away. I found out I was might. I could fly, make myself disappear, could not be shot and I was might. I started to work on the communists. I pushed them off walls, got them by the feet and whipped them on the ground and threw them at a distance. I was tried to be killed by their gunner. He tried to shoot me, but couldn't see me. I roared above them and they all fled. The gunner and his partner hid from fright. I saw their feet stick out from the hiding place. I yanked him out and whipped him on the ground and killed him. I was master of them and they were sure because they were afraid of me. A woman was denouncing our government. I got hold of her and tossed her across the street."
"0328"	"(07/02/53)"	"I ran my car thru a big bank of snow on the road. In the screw dept. there was jewelry all over the floor that girls were sorting. Joe Grabar and I had to walk thru different aisles to get by the gems. I was in a hospital. My brother Steve was there. I stepped on a stairway and it was full of shoes. I came to the bed or table where Steve was and to my surprise Tony Marlot was there dressed in white and was supposed to be a doctor."
"0329"	"(07/03/53)"	"There was some kind of glass that someone invented. It was to look thru. I had to sign my name to get it. I signed John M. Evans. Chiska also signed. I think I helped to invent it. A tiger chased me up a stairway and into a house. I closed the door and held it. He kept on pushing and pushing, but I held the door. A lady was there. I told her to go get some help. She picked up her baby and left, said she would. Grandpa came up and gave me a gun. I pointed the gun at the tiger and he surrendered, then he turned into a boy. I was in the city. Someone had two barley animals. They looked woolly and were like a tiger. Grandpa had a toy. It was some chemical. It got hot and boiled. A small kid came by and drank it. He started to make faces as though it burned inside. I got him a glass of cold water. He drank it fast and it seemed to fix him up."
"0330"	"(07/04/53)"	"I was at Charlie Charvat's home. He had a swampy spot that was grown over by a viney tree that was full of roots. Charlie and I had axes and started to chop up the roots one by one. We had the place cleaned up spick and span and there seemed to be no mud left there. They told me to look at myself and I looked at my face and arms and I had black spots of mud all over myself. Then all at once Charlie and I were on his bed. I picked up a pillow and tossed it on the other bed and I noticed it was overrun with ants. I lay on the bed and covered up with the bed cover and imagined of sleeping. I was going to load some kind of wagon. It was covered with a complete cover. I was inside, so I opened some of the top and I could feel a little fresh air within because it was stuffy."
"0331"	"(07/09/53)"	"I saw approval as a winner in one of the races. It seemed he paid about $20. I had a hammer and a nail. I was driving the nail thru a rag on the bench and I was looking at the entries. There were a lot of nails on the bench. I have a vague thought that I saw a Mac horse run 2nd and it seems I saw a reward horse that won. There seemed to be entries on a race. Then under the entries these horses were marked larger in print and were winners."
"0332"	"(07/09/53)"	"It was night and I went out to move my car and I noticed when I got out of my car, another car pulled up and I knew they were after me. So I flew up and over their car. When I was flying along some high hedges, it dawned on me I was flying and a flying horse should come in. I went into the house and I tried to lock he door. It was like on 68 St. Then I tried it and it was still open. I pushed the button the other way, and still it was open. I pushed it shut and I noticed someone from the outside was forcing his way in. I held it back and yelled at Frank J. to get my shotgun. He was frightened and ran out. The crooks went to the other door, so I ran into the clothes closet and got my double barrel. It was a sawed off gun, to my surprise. I picked up two shells and put them into the gun. I noticed it was plugged up, but I opened the door and commanded them to beat it or I would blow their heads off. If they charged me, I would be out of luck for the gun would explode in my face. They walked off frightened and I was master of them. I came to a ghost town where everyone was a spook or dead person and alive again. One man jumped out of a window. He had tattooed arms and someone said, ""Look how he floats thru the sky,"" and he really floated at leisure in any direction he wished. I worked my hands and legs and I flew up, a boy spook got on my back and asked me if I would take him to the show. I rode him and when I flew into the show, it was full of ghosts sitting in the auditorium. I saw my family sitting in an upper corner. I was afraid for them. I flew down front and I saw Grandma Evans slumped in a seat. Her head was down on the floor. She was bent forward. I raised her up and I noticed she was headless. I asked her if the ghosts cut off her head and she said they did and promised not to hurt any of my family. Grandma did that just to save my family. I sat and watched a show. I saw Sid Hamlet. He yelled and waved at me. He was a ghost also."
"0333"	"(07/09/53)"	"I was looking at pennies. There seemed to e a foreign penny in my hand."
"0334"	"(07/09/53)"	"I was working in the shop and Johnnie Berg was my boss. I was putting clamps on high top shoes. I did the job the first time and I picked up my jeans and showed Johnnie the clamps on my high top shoes. He said it was a good job."
"0335"	"(07/10/53)"	"I worked late and came home at night. Ann was in a room with me and other friends. She was putting on a smock and she had her back turned nude. She tried to shake down the smock and did she shimmy shake her body. I bawled her out for being overexposed in front of people. My sister Ann was there also and she was nude also. I came home and Andrey and Bob were sleeping on the floor. They awoke and wanted to come upstairs. So they did. I was walking home. I saw two newsboys put down paper money and they were shaking their papers in place. I looked up at the sky and day was beginning to break. I was driving my car. I had to stop and all at once I was standing on a hill with about 8 or 9 rows of men and about that many deep. The cop counted the rows and said ok. We ran down the hill across the tracks, then I stopped. There were two fellows running down the hill racing. One that was ahead was yelling as he ran he won. My wife walked thru the room later and the smock was open in front and she was exposed to my friends."
"0336"	"(07/11/53)"	"Put everything you got on it. I heard that, then I was half asleep and half awake as I lay in bed about 7:30 a.m. I saw Loddie and 2 other men and they were redheads. I looked at my Bob and he was redheaded. I saw guards walking into a building with their hands up and a policeman got in line with them and he had his gun in his holster while the others had no guns. I told Loddie that the three redheads were triplets, and he said no. I coughed and kind of forced it a little, then I spit and it was blood. It kind of excited me. During the day it dawned on me that the power was going off and on and the lights were going off and on. I was thinking of the clock shutting off and on and he time would be incorrect."
"0337"	"(07/12/53)"	"I went into a locker like. It was too tight inside, so I propped my knees against one side and broke the wall thru. I was at St. Andrew's church. I started to walk away and I heard someone yelling John Evans. I paid no attention, but walked away, then I stopped and turned around and looked and I saw and heard a woman yelling Evans, so I walked in and a man walked towards me and gave me a big package. I had won a prize. Someone gave me a wallet. It was loaded with money. I looked at some of the bills and there were $50 bills in it also. I am not sure it was to be mine or belonged to me, but it seemed to be mine. I was climbing up a rock span. I got on top and Bob was coming behind me. Some of the rocks were crumbling and he backed down a little, then started to come back up. I went down under the house. It was dark. I had a flashlight and I walked to my bed in there."
"0338"	"(07/13/53)"	"In my sleep I was thinking of what horse I would have next to play and movie came to me in my dream that it would be a good one to play next. Prom seemed to be in my dream. I seemed to be repeating it in my dream. I was in a city and they had one main street detour. There were signs up. I ran a streetcar. I was working in the shop and I had a bushing job. Some pieces were undersize and some were marked or rough. My sister Mary was not living with her husband. It was not Henry, but some Italian man. His brother was helping Mary to write her letter having her husband come back. There was something in the letter that was not up to par. Grandma came up and erased it, then started to sign her name. I said, ""That's not right. You're not to sign your name there."" So she erased it. I was sprinkling water on the boys from the shop. I picked up a black book and John Arendas had his name on it and there were other names and his address on it."
"0339"	"(07/14/53)"	"I was at Bob Lippert's home. I was in a bed. I had some covers on myself. I saw his two sons' babies. They were nude and I just had my gym shirt on. I was a little ashamed. I looked into the other and room and I saw Mr. Shimpo. I took a look at him and he looked like a bully. I was in the house. I looked out and it seemed cold. They said it was about 6 or 7 above. I said, ""I don't think it's so cold."" My car was on Superior Ave. getting serviced and I was on Superior somewhere around 60th or 70th street. A car was coming, I said, ""A superior car. I can ride to 116th Street."" I was running to the car and the light changed and the traffic started to come. So I slowly flew above the traffic, then changed my mind and started to fly to 116th St. A fellow was near me for I flew low and slow. He pitied me, sort of held me back a little. He thought I was drunk or something. I noticed my arms didn't flap as they usually do. I finally came to a high cliff and my destination was down below. I looked down and I really was nervous. I finally jumped and glided down to the ground. The man and woman came down to me. They thought I got hurt so I told them I was Superman. The woman got frightened and sort of fainted like. I said, ""Superman is a good doer, not evil; don't be afraid of him."" They finally braced up. I was eating peaches. I was walking thru a different dept. and it seemed so hard to walk. I was slow. I was drawing coke. I put the hose into the oven to water it. I looked into the sky and the sun was so bright and clear. I watched Arthur, the time study. He was doing a job of rubbing. He did it so fast that it couldn't be done all day at that speed."
"0340"	"(07/15/53)"	"Ann and I were walking thru fields and we stayed near the fence for a couple of bulls were chasing us. We outsmarted them all the time. I was walking thru a neighborhood where there were small lakes and there was good fishing. I think I had a dream about a shue horse I should play, in grand view harness racing or in the regular racing. I was working in the dairy washing out the tanks. Then we went bowling. I was lying in bed with Pauline Lenarcia. She had her vagina against me and did she have suction from it. Wow what a suction."
"0341"	"(07/16/53)"	"I wanted to see silver in the raw state, so I was let into an old building that was locked under key always. There was a barrel of it. I poured some of it in my hand and it was yellow. I noticed it was small balls, had holes in it and there was a thread inside. I said, ""This is not the raw state."" I tried to lock the door with the three locks and only one held. A couple of bandits came to the door and demanded the door be opened. So the owner opened and let them in. They wanted the silver, I saw, but the owner gave them the copper and brass and they didn't know the difference. The other door was open on the other side of the building. Charles Charvat and I ran out the door unnoticed. We ran right thru an open field and I thought at any moment we would be shot by the bandits. Then we came to a mist like and felt safer. We wouldn't be seen by the bandits as we got near to let the police know of the robbery. I looked at a piece of silver. I unraveled it and it was a silver wrapper. I said this was not raw silver. I was in a building near by boyhood school."
"0342"	"(07/17/53)"	"I was looking for a job in the steel mills. I took a time card and punched it, then I noticed it was not mine. I bought some kind of toy for Bob. I was in bed with my sister Mary. Her boyfriend across the street. He was jealous of her and was watching her."
"0343"	"(07/18/53)"	"I dreamed I saw my sister and the brother-in-laws in the White House Tavern."
"0344"	"(07/20/53)"	"I picked or saw numbers. 3737 was a winner of a car on a raffle. I was thinking of a daily double at N. Randall 3 and 7 p.p."
"0345"	"(07/24/53)"	"I saw three names of persons and the top one was mine, John Evans. It was like on a table in a plate."
"0346"	"(07/25/53)"	"I had a small moon in my hands."
"0347"	"(07/26/53)"	"I was with Ike Eisenhower, our president, and he gave me a long strip of 10% discount tickets. I rolled them up and put them away. I remember I got a discount on one of those tickets on a bet on a horse. I was on a high hill. There was a crowd of people that I knew."
"0348"	"(07/27/53)"	"I tried to dream if Shining Deed would win his race today. I saw him start to run and he seemed to me he would win, so I placed a bet on him, $5 across the board. I met my brother Mike. I drank a bottle of beer for I was thirsty."
"0349"	"(07/28/53)"	"I was with a couple of friends in a cave. We were prisoners or worked there. The other two tried to steal or escape and they put out the lights and we got part of the way out. The guards came after us. I was innocent. I lay on one side of the cave away from the fireworks and one of the men came near me to escape the bullets."
"0350"	"(07/29/53)"	"I was working in Rivertown on the brick road we had the automatics. I was cleaning out the brass chips out of one so I could run it. I filled a small wooden box and the oil ran over, then I sat it on the machine so the oil would run back into the machine. Ed Mucines was working with us. I looked around for empty boxes and I found them one by one. I was picking up a nice young girl, then I would kiss her. I was reading and I saw Robert Pream or Prem, I thought of prom. I held this girl up, her head was above mine. I held her tight and gave her a kiss and hug once in a while."
"0351"	"(07/30/53)"	"I heard someone say, ""Yes, go ahead; why sure,"" to my answer. I wanted to dream if Approval would win again. I was an usher in church. I passed the basket and Jimmy Clear gave me $21 to donate to the church and he said he wanted a receipt and I told him I would get it for him. A fellow had two bags of money and was going to put into a wall safe. There was some kind of trough and bottle of whiskey in it. I poured some good whiskey into it and told Martin Kmetzs to give me a pint of it when it was aged about 10 years. I was overexposed. I just had an undershirt on and I was in school. I walked by two girls and my penis was exposed and I was conscious of it. One girl stopped to talk to me and I leaned against her leg and tried to hide my penis. It started to get hard and hot. We talked about shoes. I told her how our shoes got dirty working on the coke yard. I heard ran when I awoke, then no, no, no. I was working on the coke yard with Grandpa and we were looking for an extra oven to pull, but it was getting time for me to go home and change to go to school."
"0352"	"(07/30/53)"	"I lay in bed trying to get a daily double from my mind and I heard #3 as the winner. I was dreaming I was in bed with Ann and Mickey Merunis, Ed and another fellow came into the bedroom and Ann played up to them, so I got jealous and walked out. I was at the Randall entrance and one of the ticket sellers told me to play a pocket horse. It was told to him by a woman. I stopped by a little girl. Her eyes were blue. I asked her to tell me what number horses were to win in the first and second race and she said ""dress."" I said, ""Not names, but numbers,"" and she said ""dress"" again. I bought a ticket for the daily double. It was 3 and 3 and I looked at it and I saw 1 and 2 on it, but I awoke before I could see if it was 1st and 2nd race. I fell asleep again and a fellow was selling tickets before the race. I was going to buy #10, but then I thought of my daily double ticket I had in my pocket, so I pulled it out and it was 1 and 2, the two was sort of blurred, but I made it out. It was a Randall ticket and there was a few letters in front of the one and two numbers that I couldn't make out. They didn't spell any certain word, seemed like foreign."
"0353"	"(08/01/53)"	"I looked at someone's hand and I noticed a big wood sliver. I held his hand and pushed on one side of the hand and the sliver protruded out the other end. I got hold of it and pulled it out. I was batting ball. I hit one way over the hill foul."
"0354"	"(08/02/53)"	"Andy's brother Tom was shooting his rifle at about 1 mile distance with a telescope. there were three of us about a mile away and the shots all were falling about six feet in front of us. I said it was a good shooting. I picked up some of the lead pellets, they were split. Andy Palider was to drive some colored boy or fellow back and forth to work. He signed a contract to do to."
"0355"	"(01/12/55)"	"Ann and I were looking for a rod for our stove in a store. She finally found in on #32 part. I wasn't a rod, but three sections of piping that clamped on the stove. I met a young, beautiful girl I knew by sight only and to my surprise, in walks Steve Bock, a fellow who worked at White's before. He had on a big old hat and a ragged coat. He walked up to the girl and she walked off with him, to my surprise. She was his girlfriend. I was out somewhere on a street waiting for Ann and he kids. I saw them stop in a station wagon about a block and a half away from me, so I played possum. I lay on the sidewalks and waited to let them find me. I finally went up to them and Shun family was with them. They had their family and children with them. I said hello to the older folk and shook hands with the children. I found myself driving down St. Clair Ave. It dawned on me I am sleeping in bed now. This is a dream and a horse by the name Night should win because it was night. The moon was shining. I looked up at the moon and it was the shape of a gorilla's head. I took a quick look and then looked again and sure enough, it was that odd shape. I drove down St. Clair. I noticed my headlights were not on, so I put them on and I drove on and noticed that the passenger service of the city was two or three boxcars coupled up were doing the service. I saw a few stop and people get off and on like a streetcar. The boxcars ran by their own power. There was no engine pushing because I looked, then I found Ann and myself on a bicycle. I was steering it. I had a horn in my hand that I used once in a while and I would let go of the handle bars. Then I lost control of it and I thought we would make a spill, but I stopped it and I looked at one of the tires. It was worn down almost to the tube, just a spot about 6"" long. I saw a tube hanging out, so I pulled it out and I remembered it was an extra tube I had in it. I looked into a shanty in Rivertown looking for something."
"0356"	"(01/13/55)"	"I was talking with Tony from Jake's Tavern. He was a graduate from a dairy college. He said he knew a fellow who took the course and it cost him $450. Then I was in the dairy. I lay by the different change processing and had a teaspoon. I was sipping up the milk and the flavor was getting better at each process. Mary Hugh, a schoolmate of mine in my youth, was walking by. I moved my head towards her and she brushed my hair with her legs as she walked by. A rowdy who was working the dairy offered the girls milk as samples, made her carry hers up a flight of stairs. I went up the stairs to the top and then started back down and she was still going up. I looked back and up and I noticed the rowdy and Mary were gone and a door to the right was open, the only place they could have gone. I had an idea, he pushed her in the small compartment thru the only door and did her dirt. I went on down into the dairy and a short while later Mary and the rowdy were coming into the dairy and she had tears in her eyes. He had forced her to his will. We were on a trip in PA. We were by Gotches and had a room to sleep for the night but changed our minds to start home by car. I looked into the bedroom and a strong breeze was blowing thru. Then we were by Grandma's and it was also in Rivertown. She made a nice ham. I looked at the thick slices right near me. It was lean, fried and red. I was walking to leave and I spotted Grandpa Evans walking between a couple fellows. He seemed to be spry and healthy. We had some money in a party that we threw. The amount was in the hundreds. I think the balance was to go to me if there was any and there seemed to be a nice balance."
"0357"	"(01/14/55)"	"I was watching someone being tortured. It seemed to come to an end and then it was a jolly happiness. I seemed to be in with the singing. I saw about 5 or 6 winners, but now awake I cannot recall any of them."
"0358"	"(01/15/55)"	"I was a government employee. We were testing a sort of secret weapon and had to be cautious because we were watched by spies and we didn't want to give them any information. It seemed to be a speed jet or rocket we were testing out. I know there was a hook used in the test. It was used either to stop or start the speed. Then I had an opportunity to learn as a high skill technician. I was thinking of my age the mortgage I had and how it would be taken care of as I was in the service. I was then a father of a baby to Ann and we were to go on an experimental performance of a few babies. I played or handled the little baby. I was riding on a boat or something similar. It seemed I had a big bar of steel in my hands. I pushed it out the door and let it down on some ice. The ice was thin and it broke."
"0359"	"(01/16/55)"	"I saw a small alligator. Grandpa Evans had a box around his waist and the alligator tried to jump into it, but couldn't make it. Then Grandpa bent down and the alligator jumped on his shoulder. He was a pet."
"0360"	"(01/16/55)"	"I was in the shop at night because it was dark. The lights went out. I put on the switch. I was driving my car at night. I imagined I would run off the road or something. I backed up and then drove on the edge or seemed to go thru the air on the edge of a concrete peer. I was looking into an old shanty we had on the lot. I was sort of skipping along the street because I wasn't using my legs and I moved along the street."
"0361"	"(01/17/55)"	"I was flying. I working my wings and I flew around the coke ovens in Rivertown. I saw the winner of the tropical big race yesterday and his next race aid $20. I was bolting up something and one of the bolts was bent and it would not come thru the hole. I was on the top of a plane looking down from the edge. I was making lunch. I split a piece of meat and was frying it. I was looking over my work clothes in the basement. I saw Bob Lippert lying nude beside a woman. I came over with Bob and I hit him gently on the legs and looked at his nude body and said to my Bob, ""You like him first."" He said yes, then no. I walked by a pond where Grandpa was sitting and I saw a snake's head sticking out of the water. I hit it with a club and down it went. I saw the rest of it as it went under water, then I hit another one and I hit a baby small one against a rock and killed him. I was operating the b and s. I thought it was quitting time, but when I looked at the clock, it was 3 p.m."
"0362"	"(01/18/55)"	"I was at the track and a #11 won the first race and the next one was 3 sixes, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, like this 6 6 6. So a 11 and 6 won first and second races. Julia Gibson was there. I kissed her on the cheek. Ernie Koelpin was doing some kind of cooking at the finish line. Carter Kotnik and a few other guys were there. I had some mixed nuts, which I ate and offered to some of the boys. I tried to sleep and dream of the next winner, but couldn't. I played pp. 11 for in the second race, but 6 6 6 won."
"0363"	"(01/19/55)"	"I was on a vacation. It seemed like PA. I was fishing and fellows were talking of catching big fish. Then I went to a meeting. I sat on the edge on a chair. Kogler came over and stood beside me. My hands were dirty. I was scraping off the mud with my nails. I was by Grandma's. I was surprised when I looked at the home. Tthey had it enlarged and made fancy or modern. It was extended to the sidewalk and they had a small wall or fence along the sidewalk. I told Mary I would like to see it. I walked into the kitchen and it was remodeled and redecorated. Off the kitchen they had a long hall. I walked thru the hall and looked over the house. They had a lot of flowers in pots growing and the new room was beautiful. It had a nick soft linoleum. In fact, I got down and inspected it. It was a rich carpet. Then I walked into a bedroom and there was Grandpa, my father sleeping. I didn't want to awake him so I walked out, but was sort of lost in the many doors. I finally came out into the hall and started for the kitchen. I sort of skipped and glided thru the air and I heard Grandpa coming and say to Steve, ""He's afraid to see me. He's running away from me."" I got outside and waited and then awoke. It was at Grandma's home again and I walked into the bedroom where Grandpa was sleeping and I went out again and got into a shoot and slid down to the first floor. I was driving downtown. I thought I saw Ann. It looked like her, but when I got there it was another woman instead of her."
"0364"	"(01/20/55)"	"We were in the open country. It seemed to me that a bull was to charge us. We made preparations and when we were charged, I took care of the situation. I was the victor. I was working for Mike Anthony. I was forcing oil into a container. It was going so slow, so Mike made a hole in another place and the can spout broke and the oil poured in freely. I could see it go thru both holes. I looked at a switch that opened the garage doors. S____ was working with us. He went into another room and was lying on a bench sleeping. We woke him up and said he couldn't sleep. I heard a fellow say, ""I'm playing Stept. He's a winner."""
"0365"	"(01/21/55)"	"I was talking with Kogler. He said he was giving away all his fruit this year. We walked by my home and I was showing Kogler my fruit trees. I pointed at a big black walnut tree, then a big apple tree. I looked down on the lower branches and it was loaded with red, ripe apples. Bob and Audrey came by. I said, ""Look at the nice apples."" They asked for one. I said, ""Help yourself, eat as many as you want."" We were eating apples and took another one and was this a big apple, about three inches in diameter and about 6 in. long. I was stacking up the papers on the big shot's desk and I always put the Holy Bible on the top. I seemed to be traveling on a trip. I was in Westbrook house and we did some cleaning up, redecorating. There seemed to be a dream of water of something I can't recall now. I was unloading steel bars. I dreamed of bread in some way. I had a lot of it or was looking at it."
"0366"	"(01/22/55)"	"I was watching kids skating and some had sleds and they were coasting down a hill. The first thing I knew, I was sliding down the hill sitting in a rocking chair. I went all the way down and then I made little movements and I was sliding along on the street. This was in Fairchance, PA. I had intimation with Barbara by mistake or by accident, and she was supposed to be my sister. I was to marry her. I was talking to a young woman up on the third floor. I was on the ground and she was on the porch. I was looking up at her. She was beautiful. I was watching a high derrick; one of the big chains ran thru our house. There were holes in the house and we were standing and watching the chains move back and forth as the derrick worked."
"0367"	"(01/23/55)"	"I was out with Earle Dilhon. He had a pet black snake. It must have been about 75 ft. long. He followed Earle around. I didn't trust him. I was afraid he would bite me. I always stayed far enough ahead of him to make sure he was not close enough to bite me. Earle and I got away from him. Earle told me about a fellow who would have a dream and figure out a horse that would win. I told him I had dreams that I figured the horses out. For example, I said I was sad in a dream because someone died. Then after it was all over with everybody including me were jolly and happy. So the next day Happy Queen was running and it won, paid $11.50. We walked back to where we left the snake and I looked over to the left as we walked by and I saw the black snake lying stretched out full length like dead. I called Earle back and said, ""There's your snake. He's dead."" Mike Arendas said he ran over his head with his three-wheel bicycle and he started to curl and twist, then tried to go under water, but he died. We went to a banquet. We had seats where it was reserved and big shots had their seats there. The boys from White's gave me a whole ham, except about a pound was missing from one end. The ham was lean and nice."
"0368"	"(01/24/55)"	"I got some postage stickers and tried to make a broken object stick in place, but it wouldn't hold. Joe Lasko was the one that had the trouble. I was working the woodwork and was watching one of the old timers sand a chair. At lunchtime I went into #5 building. It used to be that stock room and there were windows on the northwest side of the building now which there were none when I worked there before because there was an annex to the building and there couldn't be any windows there."
"0369"	"(01/25/55)"	"We bought the old home back on E. 68th Street. I looked it over, inspected it and it was left in good condition. I told Ann, ""See, I dreamed we were back in this home about three times and now here we are."" I was thinking of the other home in Parma and Ann said, ""This one will only cost us or the payments will be about 15 in Slovak."" We were near the car barns and there was a small woods which was loaded with big squirrel. A salesman came over and wanted a couple cans of stardust. It was some kind of a mixture in a can. I saw the name on the can label. The boys were taking oil out of small gallon cans and the name on the can was Ray Oil and it was for Ray to use. We were planning on going to the Charleston track. Carl Fisher and I were walking thru a field. We took our privates out. I walked with it out without holding it and I urinated in the field."
"0370"	"(01/26/55)"	"I was by the door of someone who died. I can't recall who it was. Wiatrak brought over a gas cap and put it on the car and locked it. I took my gas cap back I was giving the deceased. In my sleep I was thinking of my income tax. I must pay $97.98 and Frank Brown said we can use Air Attack and Air Attack seemed to be in my mind and dream continuously. Air Attack is a name of a horse and I remember he won the last race and paid a good price. We were out in the country. I saw funny-looking cow. I thought it was a bull. I climbed a fence. Then I flew up and was above the cow and it turned out to be a man and he was a nasty one. He couldn't do anything to me because I was in the air flying. He had a couple of bottles and I picked one up. He hit one of my bottles and his broke. Then he hit mine again and his other one broke and there was glass on the sidewalk. I was finding pennies on the ground and as I picked them up, I counted them. I was kicking someone's head, a horse's or cow's."
"0371"	"(01/27/55)"	"I was working and when I was thru, I couldn't find my clothes. I looked high and low and couldn't find them. I came over to Ernie Koelpin. I picked up a piece of leather. It was thick. I said that would make a pair of soles for shoes. My shoes are what I was really looking for. I was in Rivertown. Eddie and Elsi were living next door to where we used to live. We were looking over the yard. I said their yard was larger than ours and they could have a big garden. We intended to have a garden also. I was looking the land over."
"0372"	"(01/28/55)"	"I awoke from a sleep in the kitchen on a chair. Audrey and Bob were there awake. I saw an overcoat hanging on a nail. I asked Audrey if the doctor was here and she said yes. At first I thought the doctor was behind his coat, but he wasn't. He was upstairs by Grandpa and I felt sorry for Grandpa. I started up the stairs to see him and the doctor. I was sort of pulling myself up by the banister. Grandpa had an object pointed at me. He said, ""All I have to do is blow this poison on you."" I yanked the thing out of his hands and went into the house. Joe Lasko (deceased) was there. I locked the door so Grandpa wouldn't come in. He seemed to want to kill me. Joe Lasko was in a crowd with me. He started to follow some guy and it looked like he would get into trouble. So I went after him and two guys were after him. When they saw me coming, they started to go the other way and I followed them for a while, then let them go and went back to Joe. A fellow approached me and started to inquire about Joe. I answered his questions, then a young lady, her daughter and mother came by. He started to talk to the mother. He knew her and he said, ""How about a date tonight? You remember you said you would give it to me."" He repeated that a few times and then the mother said ok."
"0373"	"(01/29/55)"	"Jan. 31 is supposed to be the day. I liked the day and had it. It seemed to be a day that was my luck or something pertaining to it. I saw Albert Lasko and Jack Lasko in caskets at different places and days. They were deceased. I was looking over the entries and I saw Ghibli or something similar. I know the horse Glibhi. It was in large print in one of the later races and I noticed it and I said, ""I am going to play this one,"" and I wrote it down. I said, ""That will be a winner."""
"0374"	"(01/29/55)"	"We lived in the country where there were wild game. We went outside. I got a flashlight and shined it on some monkeys that came near the house. Then I shined it into the brush and saw deer. Bob had an air rifle and went into the field and I told him to be careful at what he shot at. I was looking at all kinds of trinkets. I was taking some of them."
"0375"	"(01/30/55)"	"We had an election. There were a lot of Masons at the election. The masons put over a crooked election and they were elected and they seized the arms and with a strong arm they took over the government. We were separated from our children, also from our wives. We all lived alone with a brother Mason who kept a guard over what we did. Everything was curtailed, even our religion. We sat in the open and had our hats on. I saw guards walk thru the streets drunk. They would abuse the people as they went by. It was hell. My wife was coming over to see me. I was afraid for her safety if the government would find out because it would be a severe punishment to her. I saw one Mason rent collector. He tortured a tenant for more rent till the poor man gave it to him. This was a sad country under their rule. I was in Rivertown with Bill Kotnik. I showed him where I lived in Rivertown. It was next door to a church. As we walked away, I looked to see if the church had a cross on and it had a paper cross pasted on the building."
"0376"	"(01/31/55)"	"There was a tornado coming. We hid the best we could and it went over. I went out and met Bob. I told him not to be afraid of tornados and not to listen when people try to scare you with them. We were in an old barn or lumber building. A tornado was coming up again. The building was beginning to shake. I ran over to Bob and got him by the hand. I kept on looking up at the tornado watching its course and we ran out of its path as it came along. Then it came down low and its point and all its body ran parallel to the sidewalk. It went between trees and we followed it across the street. I watched it as it whirled. It was about a 100 ft. long and about 10 ft. in diameter. It was not doing any damage because it knocked no trees down. The tail end of it there was a sort of bluish light and seemed like a fan turning to keep it moving and twirling of the cloud. We then left it and went thru a barbed wire fence and I found a $10 bill, walked a little further and found a $20 bill. I put them into my pocket and told Bob to say nothing to no one that I found the money and he promised. We were walking towards the lake and I thought of writing a book of my dreams. I heard or saw zigzag as a winner."
"0377"	"(01/31/55)"	"I took a couple of doughnuts and walked towards school in Rivertown. I gave one to a boy there and it turned out to be a pair of trousers that I was discarding. He took them and looked them over. He as a rule would clean and mend them, then sell them. I was early to school so I was walking back home. I had other dreams that I can't recall now. I was in a field with a friend of mine and we had an idea there were bulls there, so we took off and were flying. He was afraid of how he would stop, so I stopped and came down to show him how easy it was done."
"0378"	"(02/01/55)"	"I stopped by a water pump. It belonged to a colored lady. A white man was there. He said, ""You have city water,"" and she said, ""We don't."" And I said, ""You would know if you didn't have city water. It is hooked up to the water line."" The colored lady went upstairs to where the white man was batching, into his room. I could hear them sing and they were talking and giving hints as to what they were doing and it was they were intimating according to what I heard. We were near a pond of water. We saw two odd-looking reptiles in the water. There was a clothesline rope in the water and it began to move like a snake. Audrey was walking on it barefooted. I yelled at her to get off. It was a snake, but she walked over and it didn't bite her. I was sitting on the railroad track with Bob and it was in Rivertown. I looked at a bank that was rocky. I told Bob we used to slide down that hill when I was a boy. I said, ""See how low that is, but when I was a small boy it looked high."" I looked farther up and there was a very high bank that was farmed now. I told Bob, ""Now that is very high."" It was a rocky cliff. I was looking at the results and I saw a lot of winners, but I can't recall them now when I'm awake. I met Chuck Parker, Norm Sherman and their families. They were lounging around on the lawn. I said, ""Boy, what a life you fellows have."" Norm came up to me and monkeyed around. Then he said, ""Look into our room and see what I'm doing."" I inspected it and he was taking off the paper and painting it in some places. He had paper on the wall all mussed up, spots where there was paper and just small pieces ripped off. It was a lousy job. I recall one winner now decorated. I went into the school of my boyhood days and they were serving meals. Bob got his and I got part of mine and then when I went for the rest of it, a friend of dad's hid my plate on the bench and I accidentally bumped the table and knocked the plate on the floor and the food dumped on the floor. He picked it up and thought I would eat it, but I walked out. I looked into a basket and saw hard buns in there. I was going to the store for a farm. Jim Lasko and I were picking up pennies we found. I was counting them as I was picking them up."
"0379"	"(02/02/55)"	"I was in Rivertown. It was night. I was by the carline. I thought I would fly and see who I could see. I was flying by the carline, then I came down past the alley and I stopped by Ann. I can't recall her name now. She lived there in my boyhood days. Her daughter was there and accused me of being a drunkard, but I said, ""I'm not a drunkard. I just take a shot once in a while,"" and Ann agreed with me. She was lying on her back with her legs spread apart. I said, ""Let's take a walk."" So we walked into the field and it was so dark, I couldn't see a foot in front of me. I was afraid I would run into a fence, so we stopped, and here we were sitting beside a table and a woman was slicing some beef off a roast and eating it. The beef was kind of fat. We then took off. I held her in my arms and we flew thru the night. We came back and my wife Ann was with me and the other Ann was someone else. I tapped her on the rear end when my wife was not looking. Then I tapped Barbara when she did look. A colored lady went up into a white bachelor's room and she sang melodies. She sang as what she wanted the white man to do to her and when he was doing it she sang that in words also."
"0380"	"(02/03/55)"	"I was playing baseball with the boys. I have a faint recalling that Al Novak and I were talking of Wateree. It won or we thought it would win. I am not sure, but that name we were looking at or talking about."
"0381"	"(02/04/55)"	"A couple dogs were chasing me. One of them, I think, bit me. I picked up something and kept them away. We came to a pile of advertising pictures. I threw a rock at one of them and hit it. Boy, did the dogs come at us, but we kept them away. I picked up Kogler and when he came into our house, Ann kissed him. When he left, I got angry at Ann. I was jealous. I bawled her out and she said I was not dressed nice. I was walking down the street with Andy Palider. He walked down the center of the street. Two cars came speeding on either side of him. He was between them and got all excited when they passed. I was in Rivertown. Dad and I were going to fill in a spot in the yard that was low. I was going to get the dirt from near the rubbish box because it could be filled later. I was walking down the street and Ann was watching me. I gave her the eye to come hither and she gave me a big smile. A fellow backed up near my car and gave it a little bump when I looked at it and I had a small dent in the fender."
"0382"	"(02/05/55)"	"I was sort of investing my money in newspapers. I was buying them and reselling them and I was making money. A profit. The next day I was doing this a friend of mine wanted to help me by putting down the investment money and share the profit with me. I agreed. I was looking at the race results. I saw one horse that paid $125.00, but I can't recall the names now. I was in the woodwork building. I was sort of lost in the departments. I was watching something up high, looking up. Captain Blood came to me as I lay in bed."
"0383"	"(02/06/55)"	"I was a prisoner with some other people held by a gangster. One of the prisoners called the police and the leader found out he came with a gun. I hid in a clothes closet. He saw me there and thought the prisoner who called the police was in behind the clothes with me. He emptied his gun into the clothes and when he did, I grabbed him, took his gun and hit him on the head a few times, knocking him down. His right-hand man was coming. I looked around and found an automatic piston. I told him to stick them up, but he wouldn't. I pulled the trigger and the safety was on. I took off the safety and pulled the trigger and a sort of fire or flash came out of the gun. This is what the man couldn't stand. He dropped to the floor and curled up. Then he got up and ran behind a wall and got away. We got out of imprisonment but were fugitives of the gangster. I was approached by one of the gang and was tried to be fooled and be captured by the gangster, but I was wise to him and didn't fall for his plans. I was flying in the country. I worked my hands and legs like swimming and I moved thru the air. A sailboat with a high mast came down the road. It wobbled back and forth. I thought it would tip over. There was a cow eating grass. She was talking with the farmer. It was in Gotches' house eating potatoes. I was full and then they brought in some meat, but I couldn't eat any. I saw a winner. It was $29 or $.95. I can't recall the name. Bill Grove was normal and was transformed into a small boy. He was dropped on the floor and bounced on his rump."
"0384"	"(02/07/55)"	"I went to the cemetery to see where my unseen son was buried. He was supposed to be a horrid monster when he was born, so the doctor took care of him. I saw his grave only and he inscription on the stone was a monster. I performed a bold act with a tiger. I commanded him to do my bidding and he did it and I passed the test. There were three tiger cubs that we worked with to pass the test."
"0385"	"(02/07/55)"	"Jib came to me. I was looking for an Ann horse in the first at Sunshine. I was holding a spring that was to denote Ann, but it was short. I went into a store on 3. 72nd and Donald Avenue to get a press final, but it was not in, so I went outside to wait for the delivery. I had a couple of magazines and a racing form in between. I was turning the sheets to look into the form, but awoke. I had a horse picked for the 2nd at Sunshine, but I can't recall him now. I was in Gotche's backyard and was it loaded with flies. I had a fly swatter and I was swatting them on a board. They kept on lighting on the board and I swatted them. They were lying dead on the ground."
"0386"	"(02/08/55)"	"I was going to the racetrack walking thru the snow and playing football as we walked along."
"0387"	"(02/08/55)"	"I was standing on a bank watching workmen at work below and when I stood on the ground so long the earth would give away, break loose and down it would go. I got on a solid piece where there were two small trees and thought that it would hold because the roots would hold it together, but after standing on it so long, it finally gave way and one of the trees went with it. I put my tools into my toolbox and locked it. I was planning on taking a trip down into Alabama and Mississippi. I was going to have my car checked to make sure it would not give me the trouble. We were talking of dreams and I said in one of my dreams I won a hundred thousand dollars, but when I awoke, I had it not. We had a little baby. It was wise. It could talk very good. I played with it. I was on the back porch and I just had on my long underwear. I was hugging my wife."
"0388"	"(02/08/55)"	"I played two horses and also a place parlay. I can't remember what they were."
"0389"	"(02/09/55)"	"Kogler and I got a job in a factory. I had on my shorts and I noticed my peter out. I pulled it in. A fellow showed me an indicator to how to gauge the work. I was using it and told him the piece seemed to be ok. I was doing some pencil work and it came out to 211 the answer."
"0390"	"(02/10/55)"	"I was on Superior and East 71st Street. Andy Palider had an elephant. He was riding him to work. As he went along from in front of him out of the ground a wheel would come out with food or drink and Andy would take it. An old-time wagon wheel. It was getting late for work. I looked across the street and there was Al Novak with his wife and son. His wife was talking fast and Al was just listening. I walked up to them and asked Al if I could ride with him to work. His wife let go of some gas and said nothing. Al spoke up and said, ""That's nothing. It's healthy and John and I feel better, don't we?"" I looked up at the top of the building and said, ""I didn't think it was so high."" I counted the stories and there were 11 of them on the top floor a dog was on the windowsill looking down at us. He jumped and I said, ""That's a dead dog now,"" but he landed on his front paws as though he jumped only a couple of feet. He was friendly and came towards us. I was home by Grandma's. I saw a cake on the desk. I started to eat it. It was a whole-wheat cake. We had an elephant Audrey was not afraid of him. He was immense. I asked Grandma if she had any trouble with him and she said sometimes he doesn't want to eat and now he doesn't. Audrey went up to him and pulled on his tusks and one came off and still it seemed like his trunk. It came off like a pipe, but the elephant sucked it back in place. Grandma took it off and was going to feed him. While he was in an enclosure waiting, he was a horse then. Grandpa came thru the room. He didn't say anything; neither did I. We seemed to be on the outs. I was by Grandma's again. I was in the backyard. I worked my hands up and down and made myself go up off the ground. Al and his wife were there again and the next time I was going up, she came up to me and gave me a goose and then Al came and got hold of my legs and I couldn't go up with his weight. I found some brass cans in the yard, so I was tossing them over the fence. I went into the house and I noticed a door going to the right. I asked Mary where that went to. I went in a couple of rooms were to the right and it went right thru to the front room. It was decorated nice and the furniture was appealing. I went outside and into Bendrock's yard and from there Mike showed me the way home was remodeled. They cut the house on a certain angle on two sides. We were sitting around at the banquet. We had on our old clothes on my coat to keep warm and so did the rest of my fellow workers. We sat around on the outside of the building and kept warm with our coat collars up. There was a cat on a driveway. Kolesar took a shot at it with a pistol and missed by 6 inches. The cat came near the end of the driveway and shit on a pile that was quite big already. Kogler took a pair of shears and tried to pick up some of the feces, but it wouldn't stay on the shears, so he put he dirty shears under Kolesar's arm. He had his shirt off and was nude from the waist up. Kolesar brought down his arm on the shears with the feces on them and held them under his armpit, not knowing what was under his armpit. There was feces smeared on his back. I thought what a dirty man Kogler was. I walked by a mirror, looked at myself and noticed I was quite handsome. I walked by again and looked at myself again and was convinced I was handsome."
"0391"	"(02/11/55)"	"I was working in the dairy and Frank Lasko was the owner. He and the Fairmont dairy were in the same building. He had half of the dairy and Fairmont had the other half. I took down some pipes. Ed M. was a master at the dairy, but by a slight seniority or something a fellow was above him, which kept Ed from getting $3 an hour."
"0392"	"(02/13/55)"	"I was running away from a bull who seemed to be coming after me. I sort of jumped or flew up on a shanty and he couldn't get me. Later we were friendly. Ann was angry at me; then she made up."
"0393"	"(02/14/55)"	"I was in the basement of the shop. It was dark there. I used the light. It was creepy there. We kept the tools there. I heard a voice say ""John"" and I yelled, ""What?"" and it said ""John"" again, so I said, ""What do you want?"" and it said, ""Up what?"" I said and I said, ""Up again,"" then it dawned on me an up horse."
"0394"	"(02/15/55)"	"I was working on the coke yard. I was extinguishing the fire on ladders. I was walking thru fields along a path where the bushes covered it and I had to go thru them. I heard something coming towards me and could see the bushes moving. I had an object in my hand ready to defend myself. I t turned out to be a rabbit. I picked up some rocks and threw them at it and it ran away. Then I saw other animals near a stream of water. I threw rocks at them and they ran away. Then I threw a rock at an arch where there were business stores and a lady was standing there. I didn't do no harm. I met Martha, my first girlfriend. I laid her on the ground and pushed her clothes up and bared her nude body, then I was intimating her. I watched her face and I could see the thrill and satisfaction of her face. I seemed to know it was a dream. My wife was there and I didn't' seem to mind it and neither did she. Then I got up and had intercourse with my wife. I stopped in Fairchance and went into the new post office. It was pretty big. I looked it over. It was nice. I asked one of the women where I could find the dead letter dept. and she said in the basement. I went outside and a fellow was following me. I thought what if he would rob me. I had some money on me. I was surprised he said, ""Hi Evans."" He knew me and I didn't know him. I saw two boys on a hill. I had an idea they would light the dry grass. Sure enough, I saw smoke and they started to run away. They came down to town and we started to chase them. They ran down one street and then back. I ran along the street and figured they would come back and I would catch one of them. Sure enough, one came back and ran across the street. I ran after him and caught him. I grabbed him by the arms and held him tight. The cop came over. He was taking down his name. While he stood in a corner, I had an idea he would try to get away again. When he did, I got his legs between mine and he fell caught by my legs. Ann and I were upstairs. It was hot. I heard a breeze blowing outside. We went by the window and the curtains moved in and some nice cool air came in. I gave Grandma a dollar to hold for me. She held it or a while and then came over and said, ""Here is your dollar. You will come over and ask for it later."" I looked at the dollar and there was about 8 or 9 dollars. There was a two-dollar bill included. I knew I made a mistake. I was thinking should I give it back or keep it. We had a little baby boy. I took him for a walk, then I let him go and he could walk by himself. Carter and Bob were eating eggs. Carter had a big pan full. When he ate quite a few of them, he found a roasted chicken in his eggs."
"0395"	"(02/16/55)"	"I was at a bowling alley. I was going to bowl. I noticed I was dressed, but I was barefooted and had not my ball and bowling shoes. I went to the toilet, which was outside, and it was full of paper to the seat top. I pushed it aside with some other paper and the seat was wet. I looked at some holy statues and I said, ""Is someone going to win his race today?"" but the statues just still no nod of the head or anything. I looked down on a picture or a movie and I saw a lady and two men on horseback riding out to see someone the lady wanted to see They were going the right way because I seemed to be up high and I could see where the house was. I was walking thru some thorns and bushes. I was pricked. I was eating and a dog jumped on the table and started to eat the food."
"0396"	"(02/17/55)"	"I was with Ann at some friends of ours from the old neighborhood and I saw John Chipka and his wife coming. They were to meet us. I was offered food and drink by the people we were with. I was counting something. There seemed to be eight pieces like the number of horses I had on a list. I seemed to end at four, then I seemed to come back to one."
"0397"	"(02/19/55)"	"I was out in Rivertown taking a walk by Homer Daughtery's far. He stopped two men and gave them jobs doing some kind of work on the farm. I walked into the woods of my boyhood days. They came by a streetcar. I got on and was the only passenger. I conversed with the motorman. I relaxed on the seat and said, ""I could ride like this all day."" I asked him how many miles of railroad track they had and he said 135 miles. I said, ""How far do you travel?"" and he said 32 miles. I got off at a small town on top of a hill and he went down. I called me down, but I didn't want to go down. There was a hose near me and the water was squirting out of it on my feet. I turned it down the hill and it squirted on him down below. I walked over to a small park. People were sitting around a sort of small lake, which seemed to have a swift current of water. It would bring in objects at a swift pace. I looked out and an old model Ford coupe came in on the current. It took the Ford around the lake twice at a fast pace, then it came to a whirlpool. This whirlpool spun the Ford so fast I moved to protect myself from being hit from any object that would break loose from the Ford as it spun at a high rate of speed. Finally it stopped dead, the door opened, and out came two small boys on a platform. As they got off, the Ford sunk into the whirlpool. It was an excitable scene. The boys said they were going to store and the current caught their car."
"0398"	"(02/20/55)"	"We were being hunted by someone. We hid ourselves by standing still, not making a move, and we were not seen by the hunter. I was on a vacation with my family. We were out of town and were gone two weeks. It seemed like a couple of months to me. I went upstairs to our room and got a rifle. Bob and Audrey brought me a bullet that they seemed to have loaded or changed. I was going to shoot it in the 22 rifle. A man stopped his car on the street and was hot because he said a person couldn't park his car where he wanted to."
"0399"	"(02/20/55)"	"I was driving my car. I stopped by an intersection and moved slowly forward, then I had a hard time to see if there was a light. I looked up and I noticed there was a traffic light and it was green. Dennis Carter was at our house and he was a menace. He did something here we didn't like."
"0400"	"(02/21/55)"	"I looked at the results and saw Uptrend 2nd 27.00. Ann and I were on a vacation for 2 weeks. We had another week to go. We were going to go to Niagara Falls for a week, but she wanted to come home first. I said, ""We will not go home, just to Niagara Falls from here."" Barbara was home taking care of our home. I was walking thru mud with Grandpa. He was sort of apologizing for what he did to me in a round about way. I was sleeping in my top shirt only, so in my dream I was walking in Rivertown in my shirt only. I was ashamed, but didn't meet no one. I got into the house and my sister Ann was in the kitchen. I had a hard-on, so I asked if she would lay for me, and she said, ""I am afraid to get knocked up."" I said, ""You don't have to worry about that."" So she lay on her back. I was just ready to get on her and my mother came downstairs, so I didn't do it. I was watching some fellows that work with me. They were digging graves. I put my arms around a pillar and held myself because I was up high on a building."
"0401"	"(02/22/55)"	"I was sitting on the porch in the sun. It was cool and I was thinking how nice it would be if I could take off my shirt and take a sunbath."
"0402"	"(02/22/55)"	"I was at a frolic of some kind and there was an announcement giving or introducing a person with a dreaded disease who was still alive and should be dead."
"0403"	"(02/23/55)"	"I was in a skyscraper. I was planning to go on a trip. I looked thru a window and across the street in a building I could see Steve Lasko, deceased, and another fellow I can't recall now. They lay in bed with a woman between them. I was watching them. I put out the light in my room so they couldn't see me if they looked. A colored fellow walked into my room. I told him to go out, this was my room. Pearl Delatt came in and said, ""Why don't you lock your door and no one will come in?"" So I did. I was pulling up and letting down a shade and Mr. John Delatt was trying to pick out a horse when the ropes or curled chips or something similar would tangle up. I was leaving a note if I died, saying, ""God bless you all,"" and I am using a wet rag. I looked down; the people were looking up. I sort of stood back so they couldn't see me. I was in a skyscraper again. I could feel the building sway a little. I looked out the window into the country, then turned to two wealthy men and said, ""I don't like this life in here; give me a single home out in the country with my small family and I will be happy."" They agreed with me and sort of took a liking to me. I said, ""I would like to have a lot of money and not go out to a holdup to get it."" They both said, ""There is a lot of money in the world and you can get it if you want it."" I looked at both men and their faces smiling and telling me it was that easy. Then one of the men said to his valet, ""Go get me some of my stuff and give it to Mr. Evans."" He came up with sticks of chocolate bars and started to give me them. They were supposed to be money. I counted them, then put them into my coat pocket. I was rich now. It was heavy. I then was in my own home with the two wealthy men. They had a bottle of whiskey. Grandma gave them some soda from the refrigerator for a wash. An apple fell on the floor. I picked it up and broke it apart because there was a hole in it. I went into the men's lavatory to wash the piece in the sink. The dog was with me. He wanted a piece of it, but I ate it all. I was trying to see a paper to see the results of the day ahead winners, but I couldn't see the results. My eyes wouldn't focus on the paper. I asked Steve, ""That works with me to read them for me."" He looked at them and didn't say anything. I was listening, but couldn't hear from him. I was in Fairchance. I saw the trolley wire up that the old trolley car used to use but the tracks were out. I noticed it was broken loose from some of the hangers. I was in an elevator shaft with Ann, Johnny and two other men I found some time cards on the floor. There were small brass nuts attached to the premium made. There was 4 nuts on one card and 8 hrs., and three on another with 7 hrs. I said, ""These poor suckers are worse off than we at the White's."" I think it was a sunny day again, but I'm not so sure. On the elevator shaft I tried to change my shorts, but there was an opening on the street side and women could see me if I did. I turned my back to the street and changed and Ann didn't like it because there were women coming by and they looked my way."
"0404"	"(02/24/55)"	"I was in a Mexican town and there a man was made a fool of when he was a stranger and one of the Mexicans wanted to play you as a sucker. I saw where a man was made a fool of because he opened up his mouth. I think I dreamed this because I saw David Crocket I a movie where their fort was attacked and captured. I was walking by the creek near Stanley Smith's place in Rivertown. I saw Louis Kaufman in a tree picking ripe green grapes and Earnest Kolepin picking cherries in a different tree. I walked into a patch of plums. I picked up doubles and triple plums sticking together. Brother Steve had a flashlight lamp and it had a bright light and he put the light on the plums as I showed them to him. Then I looked at the light and it was like a fisherman's lantern, but a battery light. I was dancing. I only have a vague idea of it because when I awoke I sort of remembered I was dancing. I was dreaming and I know I was dreaming in my sleep. I said to myself I am dreaming this. It is not real. It was night. I watched for a nice girl to go by and had intentions of intimating her. I saw some go by, but not to my satisfaction. I came to a cave. I looked into it. It was a big cave. I drove Bill Kotnik and a couple fellows home from work."
"0405"	"(02/25/55)"	"I was driving a bus. Two other buses were coming the other way. They stopped on the corner and had the directional lights flickering to turn left. This kind of bottled us up because I couldn't make a turn to my left to make a trip back on my route. I was at a housewarming or it was a house open. There were rich and common people there as we went in a line. I noticed the rich got whiskey from the caretakers and I and the commoners didn't get any. In fact, the man with the whiskey took my drink himself and the same with the rest of us commoners. As I went by some waitresses were going in the line with food. A chef stuck out a plate with two beef sandwiches smothered with onions and said, ""Give this to him,"" so I carried the sandwich and as a few smothered onions fell on my hand I ate them. We commoners were snubbed."
"0406"	"(02/25/55)"	"My dad was still staying with me, but I ignored him and it was 2 days that he left and was not back. Frank Lasko was in Grandpa's bed and he was there 2 days already. I didn't know till Ann told me I had an idea. He got into an argument with his wife and left her for a spell. Just as I fell asleep I was out in the field and a rabbit jumped up and ran and it startled me, so I awoke. The rabbit was scared. He jumped when I was close and he also scared me."
"0407"	"(02/26/55)"	"I was going thru or near a fence and there was a big dog there. He came at me. I sort of went up above and the fence, but the dog jumped up almost over the high fence and tried to bite me. He did that a few times and I sort of had to go higher, so he couldn't get me. I was out in the country hunting. I saw men shoot at some pheasants that flew over. I saw some fly over very high, so I shot at them, but couldn't reach them. Bill Kotnik was mad because he wasn't getting any work. I was walking over a lot of chips and I think I crawled over them. Roosik, the old real estate man from the old neighborhood, was at my home with another friend. We sat in the parlor and I told him how nice it was we had a cross ventilation in our home, but it was not so cool in the summer now like when we first moved out here because the place was not so built up like now. I looked out and saw all the homes now. I pointed out what was all fields before now it is all homes. I was looking at a picture of some rich man. He had the race results on the picture and it was supposed to have played some kind of a five-horse parley or a system of this type."
"0408"	"(02/27/55)"	"I was looking at a pile of pennies and I found a few old Indian head pennies. I looked at one I held it close to my eye and on a slant it was bright and shiny and the series was 1830. I could see it so clear. Audrey was in the eighth grade. She had a month and a half to graduate and she wanted to quit already. I didn't want her to. I was in church. We had chairs to sit on and I got a rag and was wiping up the chairs that were dirty."
"0409"	"(02/28/55)"	"I was out hunting. I saw a hawk sitting on a tree. I had a double barrel shotgun, but only one shell in the gun. I pointed the gun at the hawks and it didn't shoot because I pulled the wrong trigger. The hawk started to fly towards me. I aimed the gun at him, but the gun wouldn't go off. The hawk turned into a duck and disappeared behind the old brick schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was out hunting again in the fields of my boyhood days. I put a lamppost in the center of the street, which is narrow and then I looked how narrow the lanes were on either side of it."
"0410"	"(03/01/55)"	"Ann and I were coming home. We were going it seemed like Granger Hill and she said there was a little tornado. She noticed one roof off a house. I looked out the window. It was a dark, cloudy night. The sky was yellow over the city from the lights. I was strutting down the street between Eli Belch's and the company store. I seemed to be walking on air. Then I was flying a little. I flew by the store, so I worked my hands like in swimming and I came back. Ann and I walked into the company store to do a little shopping. She picked up a bottle and handed it to me. I looked at it and said, ""This bottle is half full and open."" She took it and took a little drink out of it and put it back. I saw glasses of berries and juice boiling hot. I told the salesman, ""That looks like it's boiling,"" jokingly and I said, ""That's the way to make jelly."" I was walking on the street when I saw George Hunzo. He was healthy-looking. I shook hands with him and said, ""You're looking great."" He said his sister took sick and when the doctor examined her, he said, ""She will have to quit smoking cigarettes, a dope."" I was looking at the results and I can't recall the winners now. I was traveling thru the mountains. It was night. I put on my bright lights and I cold see dust on the road from the car in front of me. I was at Amel's. I looked and I had a small double barrel shotgun. It had two small holes and the shells were small and seemed to be hollow."
"0411"	"(03/02/55)"	"I was in Rivertown. I walked thru snow. I went into the snow up over my hips to my shoulders, then I turned around and was going to go back, but my friends from the shop helped me to get thru. I looked at a paper at the results, but can't recall the odd names of winners. Then it dawned on me to look again and remember them, but I couldn't find the result sheet. I looked, turned the pages and couldn't find them. I was walking down our street of my boyhood days at night."
"0412"	"(03/03/55)"	"I asked Nate and Whistle which horses they would take from a list of 9 I had on a card that I picked from the entries. I went to bed and tried to dream which one or ones would win and Whistle said #3, which was Point Barrow and Nate said #1, which was Penny Achance. I was walking along barefooted with Bob and Audrey. We came by a small puddle of water and there were a lot of water bugs in it. Audrey told me to walk thru it, but I said, ""No, those bugs are all germs."" Then we were up in a tree with Kotnik. He put a rubber tube or hose in his pants and there was dirty, muddy water coming out of his body thru the hose into a tube beside him. The tube was full. He turned the hose on me and got my pants dirty and wet, then he turned it on Bob and got his face all muddy. I didn't like it. I cleaned Bob's face and we got off the tree and were going to get the car to go home. I called Audrey, but she stayed in the tree with Kotnik. Then I saw Bill Kotnik again draining himself of the mud again. I stopped at a gas station and the fellow wanted me to go to the left of the station to the gas tanks, but I said, ""I can't get in there; it's too narrow."" He wanted to bet me I could, so I said, ""I'll bet you $55, no better $1000, that my car can't get in there,"" but he changed his mind. Later I proved to him it couldn't get in the narrow space. I drove my car to the edge of a cliff and stopped on time. It was dangerous."
"0413"	"(03/04/55)"	"Mrs. O'Korn had a large table of fresh bakery. Ann was picking out what she was going to buy. The children were asking Ann questions of the human body. Some she was leery to answer of the sex organs."
"0414"	"(03/05/55)"	"Bill Kotnik had a high step ladder on the lawn. I climbed up part way and the ladder was shaky. I cam down and made the ladder solid, then climbed up. I went up above the trees. I saw walnuts and then I saw red tomatoes growing on a vine. I yelled down at Ann to look up at the red tomatoes to see if they were tomatoes and then she said they were. I took one and ate it. It was delicious. I was driving my car on the highway."
"0415"	"(03/08/55)"	"I was in the wilderness with friends. A fellow's son was way out in the field by himself. A car was chasing him. He yelled to him to run and keep away from him. Three of us started to run to his aid. We picked up anything we came across. One of us picked up a club. I picked up a shovel and so did the other fellow. When we got near the bear, he was close to the boy, but we got there on time. We started to hit the bear on the head with our club and shovels till we killed the bear. We had about seven bears that we killed that way. On the way back we were eating prunes."
"0416"	"(03/09/55)"	"We were at a picnic like. Johnnie was supposed to be fighting with a chimp. There were fights there with bulls. I didn't see them. I was looking for fighting or blessed bulbs in the entries. There was a lot of debris around. I just passed it up and the people expected everybody to pitch in and clean up. I intimated my sister Mary and was going to intimate sister Ann, but there was someone in the room and we were aware of it. I was in PA. I saw George Gtoch (duke) walk by. He looked young."
"0417"	"(03/10/55)"	"I was watching some of the fellows fishing down by the lake. They caught a couple ten pounders. I saw an odd kind of fish. It might have been shrimp. It lay on the ground and the bait was on the ground. The bait made a move and shrimp crawled over to the bait and got on top of it and it was caught. I was painting houses. I painted it seemed a whole row. I just had one side to do. They were in Rivertown. I saw Laternal in the paper the other day as a winner. Now I am not sure whether I saw this in my sleep or I was thinking of it. Anyway, I think I saw him as a winner again."
"0418"	"(03/11/55)"	"I was intimating my wife. We were nude and were on the floor. My brother-in-law was jailed for reckless driving and he didn't care whether he was locked up or not. He seemed to be mad at his wife."
"0419"	"(03/13/55)"	"I was reading about publishing books before I fell asleep. In my sleep I was looking over books. I looked at a small one and it seemed like it was cut small, then I looked at a regular size book. I had them in my hands and was looking them over. I was in Rivertown in the alley. I saw someone do something wrong. It was driving a car or something and I was seen by the person, so I made off as though I didn't see it, so they wouldn't get suspicious of me. I then went out looking for the party. I was like a detective, but I had a hard time tracing her. I bought some meat and the butcher was trying to cheat me. When I bought it, I threatened him and he knew he was in wrong, so he told his partner and his partner came out to me and offered to take this meat back and give me better meat. I said the butcher sold me a lot of meat that was too fat and he gave other people good lean meat. He said he would take care of it from now on. Then he walked back in the butcher shop. I felt sort of sorry for him so I was going to go back to have it fixed up. I told Carter about it and I had sort of pictures or statues of bulls and I show him what he tried to sell me a small one and a large one instead of two large ones. I saw a dog's head. It was a double head with three eyes. Joe Grabar, another fellow and myself were trailing a suspect. We were like detectives. We came to a cave in coal mine and I looked down and saw our man. We had spears to throw at the man and he surrendered. Joe went down into the hole, which was about 20 ft. in diameter and then I yelled at him to pull a gun on the man, which he did. Joe called me down and gave me a gun and he left. I held the gun on the man and he didn't seem to fear me so much. He was trying to get away. I pulled a little on the trigger and said, ""I blast you if you try to get away."" Then the man was a woman and she didn't fear me either. I held the gun on her and then I awoke."
"0420"	"(03/13/55)"	"I was walking thru the fields and the small weeds looked like a small forest. They looked like trees and beyond there was woods. Bill Mohr was walking with Joe Grabar. I said, ""Hi Bill,"" and he said, ""Yes, Bill what?"" and I said, ""Yes, you are Bill and look like a Bill."" Joe walked down the hill with us an we were watching for pit holes. Then finally we came to one and I said, ""This is what you can see a lot of here, a lot of cave in into the coal mines."" We looked into the hole and there was a man in there. We threatened and commanded them to come out and he did. Joe had a gun and I told him to hold the man captive. He held the man and I was up on a bank looking down on the suspect and Joe. I went down and Joe gave me one of the pistols. I pointed it at the suspect. Joe was going away and I was to guard the man. Joe left and the suspect was in my hands and could see he was trying to escape. I pointed the gun at him and threatened and commanded him to not try to get away or I would blast him, my finger was on the trigger and I was pulling slowly on the trigger. Then the man turned into a woman and she tried to get away. I threatened her with my gun and fist. I also threatened the man before with my fist."
"0421"	"(03/15/55)"	"I was in the house. Ann an Audrey were outside with the dog. We had a big dog. I came out thru the side door and Ann sent the dog in for me. He didn't know me. I was out late. It was about 5 o'clock in the morning. We had a small baby sitting in a high chair and I was surprised. She was singing to the music on the radio. She would say the words ahead of the radio."
"0422"	"(03/16/55)"	"Loddie gave me a can. I thought it was water and I drank about half of it and he said it was castor oil. So for a counteractive, he gave me lubricating oil and I tasted it and couldn't drink it. I was by Dr. Conn's home on the street. I was working and the Jew next to us had some kind of shop. I did some of his work for him. I was cleaning out the machine and it seemed like ashes that were there. Bernice was sitting on the floor with her knees up and I looked down at her and I could see her vagina. I looked into a shoot and there was a pile of rags. I could see the black hair around her vagina."
"0423"	"(03/17/55)"	"I was watching someone doing something and I said the job was not so good. I saw Millie from White's kissing her mother. I was in church. We were practicing for something. I laid down on the bed. Rose Lasko came by and I said, ""Crawl in here if you are tired,"" and she did. I had my old Pontiac. It was parked on the street. It started by itself and rolled to a fence railing, then came back. I watched it, then it started out again and by the time I got out, it was going down the street with the rest of the traffic. It was a car that I yelled at the first time. I commanded it to come back and it did, but the second time it did not heed me. It got away. Ann, Bob and I were by Rose Canty's. She gave us soup. Charlie came in from the next room. It was after midnight and Bob wanted to go home, so I said, ""Ok, but be careful."" He ran home. We were on East 71st and lived on 68th St. He came back and was dressed heavier. There was a squirrel around. He walked over the table and I yelled to get off and he did. I had some walnuts. I threw one to him and he ate it. I got a nice big kernel. I held it in my hand and said, ""Here Bob, you eat this. It's too good to give away."" He ate part of it and dropped a good size of it to the squirrel. He started to eat it and Trixie went in to get some of it. A battle started between the two. The squirrel got Trixie by the throat so I came down with my foot on the squirrel and he pulled back with Trixie's windpipe in his mouth. Trixie lay there breathing her last. I had a hard-on when Rose Canty came near me. I could see her fat legs. I had my shirt over him so she could not see it. Ann was playing records. The needle sort of skipped over some of the records. I told her to shut it off because it would ruin the records. I was with a lot of colored people, but they were all mulattos, white. I was sitting behind one and he had a wart on his hand. He talked about getting rid of it. He looked at me and tried to touch me with it. I moved. He then did touch me and I rubbed the spot back on him. I then flew up and he couldn't reach me."
"0424"	"(09/22/56)"	"We were at Tesar's home. All at once one of his cabinets started to fall apart. I pushed it in place, but it was built of pieces and it fell apart again and I let it go because I couldn't do anything with it. There were a lot of men learning to be firemen. Tesar came over and he took one small hole with a damper on it and took off the damper and made a draft which got the fire burning. He then put some coal on it and he had a good fire going."
"0425"	"(09/23/56)"	"I saw Good Man as winner in first at Cranwood. I was a waiter at some kind of shindig. I saw 1 + 10 P.P. as I tried to see daily double in my subconscious mind and then 5 + 9 came to me."
"0426"	"(09/24/56)"	"I locked in some of my friends in a barn and then I set fire to the barn and I let them trapped inside to die. But to my surprise they got out and were after me. I was in flight from them. I sure was afraid they would kill me. I was trying to dream what horse was going to win at Cranwood today and I saw PP 7 around the 6th or 7th race at Cranwood. I was almost sure it was race 7."
"0427"	"(09/25/56)"	"I was flying along as the boys were walking. I worked my hands like wings and flew. I flew above two dogs and they came along. I looked at my tires and they were worn. The treads were worn off and I was irritated at the car. I was driving along with Ed P. on my running board. I went down a steep hill and I came to a narrow bridge going across the river. I missed the bridge and my car went over on the side of the bank and hung there. Ed was just about falling into the river. I helped him out and then I got out and said, ""I hope the car falls into the river."" The river was swift. I saw a man floating in it. I don't know whether he was swimming or was drowning, but I saw a gush of air come out of him because of the water made bubbles as he did it. Then my car slid in and disappeared into the swift river."
"0428"	"(09/26/56)"	"I was cleaning off something off a truck and there were a lot of red rags underneath. We were playing ball out in the field in Rivertown. I had a nice view of the green grass and nice open field. I was with two men who were arguing. When I got back, one man was all cut up and bruised. A man was holding a knife in his hand and the third party just came in and the man holding the knife told the fellow who just came in, ""Where were you so long?"" Then the man with the knife put his tongue out and the other fellow held his hands on his face, looking at the sliced tongue. The fellow with the sliced tongue looked at a mask on the other man's arm and said, ""You did this to us, but you better stay and help me with this other man."" I was going to sleep on the porch, but it was raining and the roof leaked and water came all over the porch. A small baby gave me a kiss and said, ""I love you."" It was so small, I was surprised it could talk. Ann and I had a key for Rudie's home. When we got there, no one was there, so we opened the door and walked in. When Mr. and Mrs. Rudis came home, they seemed like they didn't like it, but didn't say anything. I heard in my sleep, ""7 come 11."""
"0429"	"(09/27/56)"	"I was camping at night with the boys. We were sleeping and someone was pestering me. He got hold of my arm and I freed myself and I was going to beat him up, but he was just joking. I heard some kids crying. They were fighting. I went over to them and they were two Joe's. The one that was crying rolled his eyes back. I could see the white of his eyes only and they were big and blue and he said, ""I love him anyway."" He meant the boy that was fighting him. We were helping a spy to get to Canada in a car, but we didn't know he was a spy. A kid was trying to hide, conceal an object. It was a rosary under some apples, but when he put the rosary under the apples, they would stick up too high and his mother would notice that. I was back at work and there was nothing to do. There were vats that were full of grease in the bottom. We had lunch and I was going to do something. I was going to clean the vats. Later Ernie K and I had brooms and we were sweeping. We were sweeping the river or brook out. It was dry and some dirty water would come down. We finally got down to where there was some clean standing water. I looked in and saw a turtle. I put my broom under him and threw him on shore. I noticed I was barefooted. So I thought if there was another turtle in there, he might bite me by the toe. I saw something like a turtle's head. I pried it with the broom handle and it came loose. It was a muffler from a car."
"0430"	"(09/27/56)"	"I was counting the money that was given to me and I was to have the biggest part for myself. There were a lot of dimes."
"0431"	"(09/28/56)"	"I was working and was going out after lunch to a store. I made a long jump on to a fence and then went over. I had a job. It seemed I was a guard or something. I was lying on top of a covered high tank and watching. I saw people running down the road. I didn't know why I was in a car going at a high rate of speed, sitting in the back and watching the one man especially running down the street. Then I looked ahead and noticed no one was driving my car. I was in it alone and a black horse was standing in the road blocking it. A policeman was holding on to his rein trying to pull him off, but he wouldn't budge. I applied my brakes and started to slow down and I saw someone turn a sprinkling hose towards the horse and he finally moved off the road. I heard someone say he was the Thastle Down Star. I looked at a board that had printing of him, so I could see the name of the horse, but awoke before I could see it. I was drinking whiskey. A friend poured me a beer glass about _ full and I drank most of it. Then gave Ed J. the rest. Then I drank a bottle of beer. There were small screws on the floor that I made and I was sort of skating or rolling on them with my feet. I seemed to be perched up so high on a seat or something and when I was coming down, I told one of the fellows that we are getting higher by the day. I was nervous when I was getting down from the height. I was in a shoe store. Denny C. was asking me if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes and I said I had enough shoes now. Then I was sitting with some people at the Bailey shoe dept. When the clerks came in to wait on us, I told the clerks who was ahead of me and then I told them that a cheap shoe was just a cheap shoe. There was no sale on good shoes. I got talkative. I said a man's shoe that is less than $14 was a cheap shoe. I told them if a woman pays $4 for a pair of shoes, she is buying a cheap shoe. She must pay $8 or more to get a good shoe."
"0432"	"(10/01/56)"	"Ann was sitting on the floor nude. Carter was sitting near her feet. She had no hair on her vagina and she had her legs spread a little, which made her vagina open a little. I was embarrassed and said, ""You are a dirty woman."" I accused her of having intercourse with Carter because she was in that position. I was angry with her."
"0433"	"(10/02/56)"	"I was in the tropics. We would hunt any kind of game. Bob went hunting for elephants. I looked in one direction of game and I saw the moon appear."
"0434"	"(10/03/56)"	"I saw the PP winners of the 1st race at Cranwood in the paper. All I remember is 8 pp 1st 7 pp 2nd. I saw Ray K. He was beside his car. It started to roll and he let it go, then he ran after it. It was going around down a road and he took a shortcut to head it off, but couldn't make it. Then there was an image of him or a double in the car. The car made a stop at the bottom of the hill and when Ray came near, his double or image of him, the image disappeared in thin air. I picked up something. I can't remember now, but it had a #43 on it."
"0435"	"(10/04/56)"	"I saw a name of a horse that was a winner, but I forgot the name now. I parked my car and Ann and I walked about a block away to window shop and when I looked for my car, I couldn't find it. I saw other cars that were old around and a fellow told me that they look that way overnight from the chemicals in the air. There was a man with some kind of new machine. He was going to produce some object out of it. We waited as the machine went into production, and all at once bicycle tires were coming out of it. He said the tires were $8 apiece. I looked and felt one of the tires, but didn't like them for the price, and it was something new which couldn't be relied on."
"0436"	"(10/05/56)"	"I saw This Miss. There was a big green moth or butterfly that landed on me. I picked it off by the wind and threw it up and it landed on me three times. I was in one of the city parks sitting in my shorts hunting ducks. I realized I left my shell in the car. A fellow came by and said, ""Are you sure you are allowed to hunt here?"" and I realized I was not, so I left the park. I was home by my mother's. It was dark. I walked into the house with a paper and I was surprised my sister Sue was there. I put the paper on a side. We had a baby at our house and I was loving it up. I kissed the baby on its mouth as it had it open."
"0437"	"(10/07/56)"	"I saw Rollicker as a winner in the paper. There was a horse that somehow he was made in half or into 2 horses. Then I saw them racing. I saw a winner in the paper. I heard Saxbee."
"0438"	"(10/08/56)"	"We were moving. It seemed out in the mountains. I went on top, then came down in a spot where we were to camp."
"0439"	"(10/09/56)"	"My penis was irritated. I took it out, looked at it and I had a few large irritations on it and it was hard. It was long, about 14 inches. I thought, ""How does my wife take it all?"" I was in Florida, came back and was going to return. Mike Plander, Jr., was living in Florida with his mother and father, my aunt and uncle. I was ready to go and Sam, the hardware man, was driving down. I got gas from Sam. It was $2.90. Then the kid said it was $3.90. I said it was impossible to get that much in because I had a _ tank full. I got into the trunk and was riding in there. Sam was driving. I was still on a trip. I now was by John Y. I was sleeping in my car. I awoke and someone said, ""Aren't you going to see John Y? He is on the ball diamond."" I went around the front of the car and washed my face. Then I looked at the car and it was all over dust in and outside."
"0440"	"(10/10/56)"	"I was at a small party. There was a small child with us. When the party was over, the child -- a girl -- was going home with us. We lost her in the crowd, then I heard her cry. I called for an officer who was guarding the party. He ran around the block or somewhere and came in front of the would-be kidnappers. I yelled to him, ""That's them!"" I noticed the girl was about halfway between me and them. I walked towards the men and when I met one of them, he started to talk. He said he was with a girl that invited him to the party and he didn't care for her. To throw her off, he took this young child by the hand and walked with her, and his girl then noticed he didn't care for her, so that was the reason he walked with the child. I told him I did the same. I wanted to meet a girlfriend of a girl that liked me, but I had no use for her. So I met this girl just to get acquainted with another girl. Then when I met my wife, I also met her with her girlfriend and my wife told me later she thought I was going for her girlfriend."
"0441"	"(10/11/56)"	"I was watching Brandy Last and another horse racing. It was still like a shadow running or moving across. One was ahead of Brandys last and he came up and seemed to nose out the other horse. I was sitting outside. I saw a bird trying to catch a bee. Then the bee came at me. I had on a pair of leather mittens and I kept on balking him as he tried to attack me. We fellows from Whites went to a party. We were drinking whiskey."
"0442"	"(10/12/56)"	"Andy P. was playing ball. I walked away, then later Louie K (deceased) foreman came over and said Andy knocked one way over to Snow Road and that was about a half mile. I thought and I didn't believe it, but later I was thinking of the wrong road to the left instead of to the right, which was not so far as I thought it was. Women were talking of getting pregnant and I bragged that all I had to do was intimate a woman once and she was pregnant, instead of many times, as men do."
"0443"	"(10/13/56)"	"I heard in my sleep, ""2-2, 2pp. 1st.r and 2-2nd race."" I was driving my car. A kid pushed a pile of cans in front of me and when my car hit the cans, it stopped dead and I hit the steering wheel with my stomach and I sort of knocked myself out for a while. I noticed I had the traffic blocked as I went around the car. A cow or bull was biting my hand, then it hit for my face and it held my breath as it got close to my face and I awoke."
"0444"	"(10/14/56)"	"I was hunting. I saw 7-7-7 winners after the second or third race. I saw it quickly, then woke up."
"0445"	"(10/15/56)"	"I had a job as a salesman in the downtown store. I dressed neat and a small girl got my department moved because she would come and hang around me asking questions. Boys from Whites were working there. I was hunting. Ann and I were hiding under a big tree. The wind was blowing hard and we took this tree for shelter. I lay on the lawn at the shop at lunch period and I wanted to know if 2-9 would be the daily double today. I dozed off and saw 1 and someone put $20 bill on the bet."
"0446"	"(10/16/56)"	"A 2 won the race or 3, but I think 2 did. Hilts was arguing with a friend of his who owed him $4000. He seemed to have found it and either gave it to a woman or was lying and hid it for himself. I was sweeping the floor by Hilts. It was raining outside and Hilts had all his clothes on the line. I heard him bawling out his son. They were arguing about something. I was walking home in Rivertown and I saw two horses running towards me at a fast gallop, so I flew up high enough out of their reach. The horses were talking. One said to the other, ""You killed the other fellow and you would like to kill more. I will give you a kick. You better stop doing that, killing people."" I saw nose $412. Grandpas Evans was cutting apart bread and the loaves were as big as a bushel. I was going to take dancing lessons. The pupils lay on their stomachs and then got on all fours and walked. I walked on my hands and feet. One young fellow said, ""These old guys, why do they want to learn to dance? They can't."" I started after this fellow and said, ""So you think we can't learn because we are old and weak. I'll show you."" He was afraid of me, so he invited me into the studio, but when I looked in, it was a kitchen and no one was there."
"0447"	"(10/17/56)"	"We were being pursued. I seemed to be the pursuer and also the pursued. We were overtaken. I slipped and fell. we were on a trip with Carter. Denny walked away, so we took off. We intended to give him a scare. As we were waiting by a light, he ran and caught up with us. A fellow with a big cart bumped the side of my car. I went out and it had a few dents in it, and it seemed to be old and dilapidated. We went to receptions of deaths in PA. I tried to park my car on top of a hill, but the brakes wouldn't hold and it wouldn't hold in gear either. I was working in the shop nude. Charlotte was working there again, so I looked for my clothes to put on. I took a dive and then was flying low, about a foot or two above the street. A fellow said, ""That's the way you fly so the cops can't shoot you."""
"0448"	"(10/18/56)"	"There was continuous flashing like heat lightning. I was at Al N.'s quarters. The place was dirty. Al was a car salesman. I looked out the window and I saw Grandpa Evans walking on his toes, coming to see me. Mary told me that the horse was not going to win. He was a sure favorite. I can't recall the name of the horse. I saw Franklin and some other historic personalities. Franklin said Carter said he would like to earn a lot of money quick and retire because he had to keep an eye on Denny. I wanted to dream what pp was going to win the 3rd race. I saw all the 1 p and there seemed to be more than one pp, like two or three ones. I thought of one and 1 pp seemed to come away from the other numbers and stood out by itself."
"0449"	"(10/20/56)"	"We were talking over who was going to win the 7th race today. There was supposed to be Rufus the Red running with Flashy Ways, but Rufus is not running today. I gave my opinion. I said between pp 2 and 3, but I prefer 3. Flashy Ways to win. I was driving along and there was ice on the road and it was slippery. Charles C. stopped by our house in his cab. I went out and he had a small car. I got down on my knees and looked at it and said, ""How can you ride in this? It is so small."" I finally said I would ride it. I sat on it, had my feet stretched out in front of it and I asked Charles to start it. It started to go and all at once it was running in front of me down the street. I was going to chase it, but I noticed I just had my underwear on and so did Charley. I was buying a ticket for the 7th race and the man was writing it out. He wrote #6 on it. Then later I heard #6 lost."
"0450"	"(10/21/56)"	"I was at the race track and watched the first race run, but I don't remember the winner. All 8 races were run, but I didn't play any of them and can't recall any of them. Harwood won a new car and was going to give me a ride in it. I was a guard and there were so many rowdies and gangsters that I had to retreat because they took shots at me and were closing in on me. I was in one of the stores and a clerk who worked at night had the cash register full of money. He took out the drawer and was going to have a small kid count his money. The boy wanted to know how much he was going to get for his work, and I said one pile. I meant one pile of pennies, but he couldn't understand. I heard 5 in the 5th and then I saw 5 men in shorts, which illustrated 5 + 5 and the center man had designs on his body. Charley C. and I were talking about the races. I was trying to explain something and he was laughing and kidding. I said, ""If you feel that way about it, I will stop talking."""
"0451"	"(10/22/56)"	"It seemed we found a diamond strike and there were a lot of hunters and they were all fighting over the diamonds. It was a continuous fight. There were a couple of small ants or bugs on the table. I hit them with my closed fist and they seemed to just keep on moving. I finally got one sunk into the table by pounding him so, but his feet kept on moving and loosening him from the embeddedness in the wood."
"0452"	"(10/23/56)"	"I was at a party and each one of us had a board with old coins pasted on it. I took off some old coins and was going to replace them with my new ones. There was a dime 1849 and there were a lot of Indian head pennies. I was climbing over a high fence and the fence broke. So I ran away, not to be blamed for doing it. I was looking thru a window and the building was high. I was hanging between two walls, hiding from my pursuer. He finally saw my hat above the wall and thought he would get me, but I got away. A fellow came around and said, ""Who took the old coins?"" I said, ""I did. I didn't think you wanted the old ones."" So I returned the old coins on the board."
"0453"	"(10/25/56)"	"I was flying around up and over fences and then I was showing off by flying up and down the street. As I was flying, I thought, ""Am I just dreaming or is it true?"" Audrey was so old-looking, she was ugly. Her shape changed and she was slow like an old woman. Red was courting his girlfriend's sister and Audrey was jealous, I could see. I got married to a young girl. I gave her a kiss and hug and she did thrill me. I held a hose and a plug from a whistle in it and then when the steam came thru, I wanted it to make a whistle, but it blew out the plug. I was bragging to some young fellows how they walk to work slow and tired and then I showed them how snappy I was in the morning. I saw glass or class as winner in the paper."
"0454"	"(10/26/56)"	"I seemed to look at the first and second races and I picked the horses in them. And when I came to the 3rd race it seemed that Ann said, ""It's 5-5-5."" She seemed to repeat the fives and meant 5 pp in the 3rd race. I was working on some wood job. I put a part over a stick and then hit the top of the stick with my hammer to lean it over. I came to one and a boy looked into the package and said, ""This one has too many rights."""
"0455"	"(10/27/56)"	"I was by Grandma and I saw her die. The home was being rebuilt. There were two carpenters driving or pounding screws, bolts thru the plaster and on the outside there was a thread to put on a nut and tighten up the bolt. I stood on the porch and I noticed the porch was shaky and would be repaired. I was buying some rags from a store and the man sold me a board. I looked at it and it was all split (cracked). I said, ""I don't want it. I want a good, solid board."" He looked around for a good piece. I was giving some nuts away. I was driving my car and the boss Joe was with me. He wanted me to take him in my car, which I did. I met two fellows and got acquainted with them. Then when I met them again, one looked at me, turned away and smiled at the other one. They were ridiculing me. I noticed that. So I said, ""I'm glad to have made my acquaintance, but I will go after the nice episode you two have made. I can do without you as friends."" And I walked away, leaving them puzzled. I was with Ray R. and his dad (deceased). He seemed to walk with a limp. I caught up with him across the street from Grandma's and I went by Grandma. I met a prostitute. I asked her for it and she called me in. She was beautiful. She stripped nude, lay on the bed and said, ""You got a surprise waiting."" She said she had a breast removed, but it was there and whole. I got on top of her and she seemed tight, and it wouldn't go in all the way. Bob took a pee down a hole in concrete and it caught afire below and burned him a little. I got a hose and extinguished it. There was an atomic explosion. We were in it. I put my arm near my hose and breathed thru my shirt sleeve and kept my eyes closed as much as possible from the rays. I got away from the area and from the distance we could see the yellow smoke hanging over the area. I thought of my mother left there. She would die. I intimated the lady. We walked by a couple lakes and down one a speed boat came down full speed. We picked flowers. I ate the rose buds. I checked my battery and it was dead."
"0456"	"(10/28/56)"	"Ann came down to the shop to see me. She stayed and put on a jumper. She was going to eat lunch. Mrs. Ann Palides was there. She sat on a box talking to one of the fellows. I was sitting with the boys at lunch period. I looked back at Mrs. Palides. She was facing us. I could see her vagina just as plain as day. We had a truckload of sawdust and there were bedbugs in it. They seemed to be flying around. There was a tray of pills in the birdcage. I told Bob to take them out or the bird would die from them. I saw Swagger winner."
"0457"	"(10/29/56)"	"I saw 3 in the 7th race and 3 in the 3rd. I was with Peter Arenclas. He was shooting birds. I saw a flasher and I said, ""Here come the cops."" He handed the rifle to me and I pointed the rifle at a bird and shot, but missed. We went into a cornfield to hide. We met the farmer and he chatted with us. Then the cops came and they were not after us, but were inquiring if Pete's baseball team wanted to play a certain team because they wanted to show Pete's team they could beat them. A lady was looking for a certain man and later chose another, saying, ""It is he who I want."" A young fellow said he was fired from the track for picking long shots, $180 one's. He said a good horse 125 lbs wt. and a long race can win it. It was a count horse. He was showing me in a race that he could win."
"0458"	"(10/30/56)"	"A lion was trying to catch me. I was on top of something that he couldn't reach me, then I flew in flight and he couldn't catch me. I flew just so high that he couldn't reach me. Then I flew into a tree. He finally walked away disgusted and I sat in a small tree and a lion or big dog leaped at me, but it seemed as though the branches threw him back with a surprise. He was puzzled while he was that way. I climbed higher into the tree. I was in PA. and our toilets were overloaded. We ran water into them to get some of the waste washed out so it wouldn't pile up inside. We complained that the company didn't have them cleaned out. I was forcing steam into a football to get it inflated, but the steam made the rubber crack because it was hot and the air came out"
"0459"	"(11/01/56)"	"I was by Charvats and there were a lot of snakes. One crawled up my leg and up under my shirt. We looked for them and I saw a pot around. I looked into it and there were snakes in it. I said, ""Put in on the stove and boil it."" That's what we did. I was in a field with Bob and there were a couple fellows knocking a ping pong ball with sticks. I had a stick and I ran for the ping pong ball. I went to the men's room and urinated and it was an odd-looking urinal."
"0460"	"(11/01/56)"	"865 came to me in my sleep. I looked at what stocks did and I saw 3 5 and I said 3 next, but I awoke and didn't see it. I was looking if my number won. I was at the track and there was a big list of horses in the 2nd race and only 6 ran. I saw an X on one of the names."
"0461"	"(11/03/56)"	"I saw or heard 109. There was some kind of puzzle or picture in the newspaper which you could work out or I could look it up in my books of knowledge and get an answer for it. The prize was in the hundreds of dollars. Red said I got it. It was #10 if I'm not mistaken. I put it on the floor beside Terrie and she was going to pounce on it, but I said, ""No, don't you touch it,"" and she was tempted but didn't."
"0462"	"(11/05/56)"	"I saw #115."
"0463"	"(11/06/56)"	"I walked thru Farkash's yard and there was a loaf of bread the size of a bushel basket. Then I walked to the front porch and there were the loaves of home-baked bread, large ones, big ones and some were shaped or baked around a shoe. One around a rubber. This was a home bread bakery. I was called to work to a steel mill and a fellow way in front of me was throwing bolts at me. I found out I was to take over a yard job of one of the employees, which was a very good-paying job. I told the boys I was not going to take the job if I was going to take someone else's job that had seniority. Here, I said, I am called back at White Sewing Machine Co. I have 31 years of service there. I looked at a paper and I saw names of winners. One was $99.60, but I can't recall the name now. I cannot get a paper. The papers are on strike now."
"0464"	"(11/07/56)"	"I was thinking of having an object put afire and them jump from a great height."
"0465"	"(11/08/56)"	"Hank S. was in the shop to visit. He talked with us. We visited a relation or friend of ours and he came home riding a big mountain lion. It was tame. We were not afraid of it."
"0466"	"(11/09/56)"	"My son came into the house to ask for something. I yelled, ""No!"" to him and I knew he had a gun. I was upstairs and he was downstairs. I locked the door when he came up. He knocked on the door and demanded a box of 22s. I got my gun out and was prepared if he would shoot. Someone gave him the 22s and he went out. I watched him go and with a man and a boy. I was driving my car and I turned to get away from it. A fellow was putting up a platform for me to drive up into the passage. We were eating and there were two bugs that went down into the food. I finally got one on the floor and I stomped him down with my bare foot about 20 times before I killed him. There was one more in the bowl down under the food. I saw a paper and names of horses that won races. One was a short name. I can't recall it. I was on a hill. I picked up an apple and threw it very high and far, near the people that were walking by."
"0467"	"(11/10/56)"	"I was in Rivertown. I was flying and having a good time. I told someone I was the only person in the world that could fly. Then I said in my sleep. I flew under icicles that were hanging from the school roof and then I dive-bombed at one of my friends. He had a long piece of stiff wire and it got me on time. I got ahold of it and didn't dive at him any more. I was by Grandma's and one of the eaves were higher on one side than the other. I was planning with Steve how to level it and I gave him some suggestions on doing it."
"0468"	"(11/11/56)"	"We had a tree that had grape vines on it. The tree had a shape of a big cone and about 20 ft. from the ground the cone part above was about 15 ft. high and this was solid with blue grape. It looked beautiful. Some colored man came close to Ann. He brushed against her purposely. I yelled at him and gave him one punch. He said something to me. I can't recall it now, but I said, ""You will get more if you don't watch yourself."""
"0469"	"(11/12/56)"	"#222 seemed to win something. It was numbers on three races. It also seemed I saw 554."
"0470"	"(11/13/56)"	"I looked at a winning sheet and I saw a wood horse as winner. We were living in our old home on #68th St. I was putting rolls in the windows and then I said, ""Why did I do that?"" It was for Joe Prince. He owns the house. Then Ann and I were out in the street. It was dark. We could hardly see. Ann dressed herself in a pretty dress and put on makeup. Was she beautiful."
"0471"	"(11/14/56)"	"I heard 44 and no 3rd number and then I heard 2 more numbers, but I didn't remember them. George Gotch, a boyhood friend (died), and two other people I knew. I went into a park and we horse-played. "
"0472"	"(11/15/56)"	"Kolesar, Fisher and I were going hunting. Kolesar got 3 fifth of whiskey. He gave me one, Fisher one and we were on W. 25th Street. Two hillbilly kids were bothering Fisher. I saw him swing at the kids with his bottle. I went out to help and then one rowdy boy was bothering me. I finally got into the car. We were driving slowly. Kolesak was driving my car. The kid pulled a knife. I got hold of it and I was cutting the rope he had fastened to the car, and he put his hand in the way so I could not cut the rope, but I did and it seemed as though I cut his hand, but I didn't. I saw #238 and another number I can't recall now."
"0473"	"(11/16/56)"	"I saw #2 on the back of a shovel."
"0474"	"(11/17/56)"	"We seemed to have an atom or hydrogen bomb dropped on us. We were exposed to it, but we laid down for a while, then came to and moved around, the strongest of us. I started to fly around, then there seemed as though a hurricane came. It was blowing down everything. I saw a large spider close and it seemed to be blowing with sparks of fire, but I seemed to be mighty, but it didn't seem to bother me. It didn't seem to move me. I was standing on a small bridge looking into a small brook in the shore. I saw a green snake, then a larger one, and about 10 snakes, each one larger than the other one. The largest one was about three inches in diameter. I put my stick near him and he bit at it."
"0475"	"(11/18/56)"	"I was working in the post office. There was a Jewish girl. She kind of was stuck on me and I was intimating her every once in a while. Carter filled his pants and he was holding them a certain way and yelled for me to come and see it. He yelled at John. I came into the shop and Kugler was working. I said, ""Why are you working on this shift?"" and he said that was the right shift and I was supposed to be working also. I disagreed with him, then later it dawned on me that he was right."
"0476"	"(11/18/56)"	"I had a dream I won a contest of running or walking and I beat my opponent by 4 points or steps. It was 407 steps altogether in the race."
"0477"	"(11/19/56)"	"I was fixing Grandma's plumbing. It was leaking. I was fixing it with wood pipe and faucets. They leaked, so I was going to the store. I was in the shop. I saw the boys reading the paper. I got hold of one and it was the 10th, an old one. Then I looked at another paper and I saw the results. I saw one horse $169. I can't recall the name now. It was a familiar name. I saw a movie where a man was floating thru the air. I told Andy P., ""I fly like that in my sleep, but I can go in any direction. I wish like a bird."""
"0478"	"(11/20/56)"	"There was a heavy windstorm and rain. I watched the rain come down from the gutters. Then another windstorm came. I watched it blow smoke by big smokestacks and it blew by big trees. They were bending from the wind force. I was going to run for cover, but I was afraid to run by the trees in fear one would topple on me. All at once the storm stopped and there were two trees near the smokestacks. They broke about halfway down as they sprung back when the wind stopped. We were visiting Jack Kearney's. We climbed up and thru a hole between two buildings. Jack gave me a gun to hunt and it was a single barrel, but he said it was a repeater. It was an old gun."
"0479"	"(11/21/56)"	"We came to a bridge that was being built in Rivertown. Jimmie Crear turned some lever that was fastened by a steel cable. I turned and opened windows. Helen Labuda came by and Ray Cuera was angry or on no speaking terms with her. She picked up her dress and I could see her vagina and she had a beautiful shape. J. Wiatrak started to fool around with her. He pulled a cork out of her rectum and was holding it as she wiggled and hopped around. We worked a couple of hours on the bridge and I wrote on a piece of paper: Cleaning off bridge for my time."
"0480"	"(11/24/56)"	"I saw #72 and #12. A fellow came over from the gas station and wanted change for 85 cents in change that he had. I gave it to him in smaller change. I was by Andy's house. There was a water line running thru it. He had about a 2 _ inch line running to the house. Then this was connected to a _"" line, then this was connected to a 30"" line, which was in square pipes about 3 ft. long and some of the pipes were different sizes down the line, which was still uncovered, but they were square. I was shooting at birds with Bob's pellet gun. I could see the pellets go and how close they would come to the birds. I was shooting at a crow at a good distance and I hit him. He flew and his feathers flew out of him as he did."
"0481"	"(11/25/56)"	"I saw the results in the paper, but I can't recall the names. I was sharpening an odd sort of knife for bread slicing. We had a meeting with our employer and told him we wanted to start 2 hours earlier if he wanted to work 2 hours overtime."
"0482"	"(11/26/56)"	"I was sort of running down the street, then it turned out to be dancing down the street and I was taking big steps and tapping hand with my feet."
"0483"	"(11/28/56)"	"I was riding Ann and Mary Palidan in my car. I had a picture on my dash. Ann P. had dirty, sticky fingers and she picked up the picture and I said, ""Please don't dirty the picture."" I was holding Audrey in my arms. She was small and I had an electric socket in my hand. She was touching the inside of the socket and I said, ""You will get shocked,"" and she did."
"0484"	"(11/29/56)"	"I was flying. Ann, Bob and I were climbing up a steep street. There was a railroad on it. One big freight car broke loose and was coming down the steep grade ahead of the freight. It stopped by itself on the steep grade. We went up part of the way, then we decided it was not worth it because if we slipped, we could fall all the way to the bottom. I hung on by one finger that I put into a hole. Ann was sitting in the dirt and her legs were dirty. She was filthy. I took a pear off a tree. Vance and Denny were there. Then I pulled the branch near and there was a big pear about a foot in diameter and about 20"" long. It was soft. So Vance stuck a knife into it and water came out of it. I was standing beside a streetcar. I ran a book or paper along the windows on the men's necks. None moved. They were asleep. A man standing watching me said, ""Watch that, big redheaded guy."" Then he moved and walked away. He was standing outside the car and his head was as high as the men in the car. He was a big man. I worked my two hands in a fast down movement and it felt as a blown up tire. It felt as though my hands touched solid air and I was gradually hoisting myself up into the air. I got about six feet up as Bob was coming by and I yelled to him and came down. I was driving a small car or contraption of some kind thru water and mud."
"0485"	"(12/02/56)"	"Carter and I were in a building about a block away from a skyscraper. We had our rifles and we would shoot at the top of the skyscraper. Once in a while I saw two dogs chasing one another across the top side of the skyscraper. I pointed my gun in their direction and shot at them as they passed. I saw the bullet hit the building and chip some of it. Then Carter pointed his gun and he shot low. I thought he hit one of the windows. I saw the manager or detective of the skyscraper outside the skyscraper looking up, and I surmised he was trying to locate from where the shots were coming. I was going to hide my rifle and told Carter to do so also. As I was trying to conceal it, the man from the skyscraper came in. I held my gun to the side of me and walked away, hiding my gun from his view. I got to a locker, put it in, and then I had a hard time closing the door."
"0486"	"(12/03/56)"	"I stopped over to see Jim. He was sitting playing cards. I slapped him on the bare back. A radish fell out of his hand on the table and he was looking for it. A small baby of his was standing on the table playing. He said, ""I will check right away. I'll see if Distinguished won."" He was a hot tip. I picked up a clock and watch attached one another and it lay on the road. A car must have run it over because they were flat as a pancake and still I heard it ticking. I was surprised. I was in Rivertown to draw ovens. The coke yard was smoky as it used to be years ago. I was in the basement and a couple of bees were flying around in the smoke that was there."
"0487"	"(12/04/56)"	"I was sort of flying around or going up like an elevator carrying a person up about 4 flights of stairs. I was looking. I was looking at frozen foods in freezing compartments. I invited two boys to dinner and they were happy because they had no food. I was at a party of some kind."
"0488"	"(12/04/56)"	"I was shopping. I wanted to buy some gum. I looked and found some gum, one stick free on some packages of single sticks. It was almost closing time, so I paid the girl a dime and said I would find it and pick it up. I found myself walking and driving down lanes of a park and this was supposed to be a store. I saw a banana growing on a tree. Then I came to a bakery dept. and there were all kinds of cakes and bread. I took two loaves of bread from a high rack of bread."
"0489"	"(12/05/56)"	"I looked at the clouds and to my surprise one cloud was coming towards us. It was coming along the ground. I said to Ann, ""Look, here comes a cloud on the ground."" There was a woman that Ann hated in our relation and she said she would not let her come to our house. We were supposed to be newlyweds and a couple lady friends of Ann's were watching us. I knew it, so we went to bed and to sleep. I think I saw a horse with For as part of a name to win."
"0490"	"(12/05/56)"	"We were clocking human racers. Boys and girls were racing. I would get in my car and catch up or beat the runners. Then I found myself running in the last few yards of the race."
"0491"	"(12/06/56)"	"Bob cut his finger and it was bleeding. He was monkeying with old scrap metal. I saw the blood and when I was going to fix it, it was Jerry's hand. I wiped it off with alcohol and it stopped then. He put on a Band-Aid. Franklin had a lot of meat ground for hamburger. I was eating on the street. The table was set on the street. I was eating in the old scrap iron yard at White's. I called for help and got the wrong parts. I couldn't shut off the party and I heard music. I climbed up on an old shanty and the roof broke in and the walls were ready to cave in. I got off in a hurry."
"0492"	"(12/07/56)"	"Some man put his arms around Ann and he was going to turn around her. I commanded him to let her go, but he held on, so I started to punch him. He let Ann go and I handled him although he was bigger than me. He finally gave up when I banged his legs and bottom on the pavement by whipping his body and hitting his legs and body on the ground. After the surrender, he got up and his wife was standing beside him. He was a big man. My shoulder reached his solar plexus. I showed him what I would do. I gave him light punches in the solar plexus. We were up on a cliff. There was an accident or something below. Ann went down and I was sitting on top of something, just had a grip with my fingers just ready to slide down and get killed or hurt. I pulled myself away from the edge and then walked down to where Ann was. It seemed there was a casket and a woman had her husband there. Carter was at our house and he asked for a drink. Ann said, ""That's all you want when you come here."" I heard someone go out the kitchen door from the house. I ran to the door, put on the light and yelled to Carter for backing. I was going to go out to see who it was. When I opened the door, brother Steve was standing there. He said, ""Maybe you better give up drinking and come over to see us once in a while."" I said, ""It's not the drinking that's keeping me away. It's on account of Ann doesn't like skinny, that's why she doesn't like to see you folks."" I was in the basement and some friend was acting tough with me. I finally got fed up and I put him in his place. I made him do what I wanted him to. I had a lot of water leaks in my pipes which were old. I looked at them and thought, ""I will have to start buying new joints and replacing the old ones, little by little. I was in the field catching a baseball when someone hit it out. I was missing them all."
"0493"	"(12/08/56)"	"We were in the house. A storm came up. The wind came in heavy blasts and I noticed the sky was reddish. I said, ""I'm going outside to see if there is a tornado coming."" I looked up at the sky. The clouds were flying fast and the wind blew hard. Then I noticed different objects forming in the sky. Bricks formed and built like a wall up in the sky and the wind died down. I was standing on the banks of Lake Erie and there were cars going by below. I threw out an object at random and it landed near one of the cars. The fellows in the car looked up at me and started after me. I flew across the park and home. To my surprise, they followed me home. They came into the house and I noticed it was Alex Rambox, an old boyhood friend of mine I hadn't seen in more than 40 years. He was going to beat me up because he thought I threw the object at him. I said, ""I'm not afraid of you, but I will tell you I didn't throw the object at you. I just threw it into the lake and you happened to come by and it landed near you."" They wouldn't believe me. Alex picked up my bread knife. I said, ""Put it down."" But he said no. I said, ""I'll fight you fair, but put the knife down."" So he put the knife down and came for me. I grabbed him and turned him upside down and raised him up and down and bounced his head on the floor till he gave up. Then we talked about other boys in the family as to where they were now and we became friendly. I saw some pigs. One of them got on the back of another and the female's vagina enlarged and opened up. I pointed the rifle and shot at him two times and missed."
"0494"	"(12/11/56)"	"I was shining my car and someone came and said if I used a banana on the car and buff it out, I would get a gloss that would hold up for months. I was cleaning out snow. I broke out a hole where there was a fire, red hot ashes. I walked up the creek and there was a steam pipe letting out steam. I saw fish in the creek. I had a stick and pushed out a big fish. He landed on the shore. Wiatrak came near looking at him and the fish snapped at his nose. I was cleaning a store and there were chocolate bars on the walls. I was eating some of them. A lady was driving my Pontiac. I looked at the results. I saw a lot of names that were familiar, but I can't recall them now. One track had fancy printing of the names and a sort of decoration. One name was Espopo or it seemed like that and it was 92, the win, and we looked at this to see if it was 92 cents or $92. Then another track had numbers stamped on metal plate. I was riding streetcars."
"0495"	"(12/12/56)"	"I was in Rivertown. I was going to pick some cherries from a tree that the cherries grew on a stem like wild cherries."
"0496"	"(12/12/56)"	"I heard someone calling Nemoween. I thought it was my wife calling and I said, ""What?"" George G. was around with his truck. He had orders in it. One of the parties was Thorn and he said it was like a name of a track. I said the name was Hawthorn. I was on a ladder near the top of the house. I was thinking of my sister Mary. She was supposed to be pregnant. we had a baby. I was playing with it."
"0497"	"(12/14/56)"	"I was under something or my throat was blocked and I couldn't get any air or breath. I thought this was my last, but a few seconds later I got my breath back and I was happy."
"0498"	"(12/17/56)"	"We were driving some pigs to the slaughter house and one of them didn't want to go. It came at us. We climbed a fence and it came after us. It got up so high I told brother Steve to hit the thin head with his stick, which he did, and he knocked off his head."
"0499"	"(12/18/56)"	"I was flying around. I flew to the ceiling in the shop and rested in the air. Wiatrak said he could fly, so I said, ""You practice for a month and if you can fly, then I will give you or bet you a $100 that you can't."" I got a garden hose all tangled up. There was a big storm coming up. We were indoors just waiting for it to come up. I ran up a ramp to get ahead of two friends of mine who were walking by way of a shortcut."
"0500"	"(12/19/56)"	"I was golfing with Bill and Hank. We were hitting all kind of objects, all except golf balls."
"0501"	"(12/20/56)"	"I looked at a fish bowl and the small island in it was continuously whirling. Ann had a magazine with the selection in it. She gave me a name and I looked for it, but couldn't see it. I can't recall the name now."
"0502"	"(12/22/56)"	"I was out in the field and I was breaking up grass with my hands, and I was eating grass. A girl brought me some of the sweet grass and I ate it. We had another baby son. I held him and thought to myself he would be 8 when I would be sixty. I had a hard-on. I was proud of it and was showing it to a lady as it trumped and stretched. It was night and I went by a shop window and looked in and saw a man working."
"0503"	"(12/23/56)"	"There was a sheet of ice on the flat roof. It came loose, so I crawled under it and broke it loose. It seemed to be flexible and I was walking under it and looked above thru the ice as though it was glass. I had on a hat of honor of some kind. I walked with a lady of honor to a dinner. I noticed I had the hat with the top off. It just had a thick band and I took it off at the table."
"0504"	"(12/24/56)"	"I was to see a building with Ann. I saw a policeman coming our way and I noticed I had long underwear on and I was outside. I walked towards the car with Ann. The key was in the door and I got in and drove away. The cop was writing my license on paper. We lived in a house that had a coal furnace. I put some coal on the furnace. Ann was laying nude. I put some hot ashes on her leg, but it didn't seem to burn her. I knocked it off with a shovel."
"0505"	"(12/26/56)"	"I was walking in the dark at night."
"0506"	"(12/26/56)"	"I saw two winners in the paper, so I called up a bookie, put them in and he took them and they paid $12 apiece. I dreamed I awoke and then I tried to remember the names, but couldn't recall them. I played two. I thought they were the ones, but when I looked for the results, I didn't see them as winners. Now I awoke and I can't recall the names I saw in my sleep. I walked into a field where there was a mare with her colt. The small colt came up to me and licked me like a dog as I pet him. Then we went behind a screen enclosure and there were a few crows inside imprisoned. When we opened the door, one of them flew out. Clyde Fleming came over and gave someone $10 for a funeral. I was surprised."
"0507"	"(12/26/56)"	"I seemed to have a lot of play in my front end of my car. I had a habit of getting ahead and staying in front of a truck."
"0508"	"(12/27/56)"	"Ann, Bob and I walked up a hill to a park. The race track there was a fight of gangsters shooting at each other. We watched. Then Bob and I walked for a phone booth and Ann went into the park on the other entrance. We met Tommy Lasko in the park. We walked thru where we buy the tickets. The track was closed for racing season. I heard someone say, ""What are you playing?"" and I looked and saw John Lasko (deceased). I knew that he was dead, but I just went on with it. Then we were looking for Ann. John wanted to see her. I looked way down the park and I thought I saw her in the crowd, but it was not her when we cane to the lady. Then we sat in the car with John, Mary (wife) and Tommy was outside talking to his dad. Then we met Ann. She got angry at me and came at me. I backed up and fell backwards over a small fence."
"0509"	"(12/27/56)"	"I was using an air pistol and a lady asked me if it shot and broke windows. I said it was too weak. We shot it a while, then Bob and I played marbles. We shot steel bearings with our hands hitting them. Joe Gruber called me to go into a booth. The number was 33 or 32. I ran. I had a hard time finding it. There were numbers all over."
"0510"	"(12/28/56)"	"I was taking a pee. I had a hard-on and I peed up above my head. I had a bunch of bananas. Audrey was small. She was walking behind me, carrying them. I heard her yell. I looked back and she was up to her ____ deep in mud. I got hold of her and pulled her out. I was helping a man to mop the floors at White's. I saw down and fell asleep. When I awoke, I was changing clothes to go home, but I saw he did more work and had the water on the other floors. I asked him when he would be thru, and he said midnight, so I said I would stay and finish."
"0511"	"(12/29/56)"	"Ann and Audrey went out. I was standing outside in Rivertown with a fellow from Gilmore. I heard a rumbling or thunder in that direction. I said, ""There's no storm coming because there's no clouds."" Then all at once black clouds seemed to come off the earth like smoke and form a big storm. I called for Ann and Audrey to come home because there was a storm coming up. I saw a maneuver of our Army trucks at night that fooled and puzzled the enemy from attack. It seemed to be a triangle shape where the trucks drove or kept driving to the front of the triangle and then backing to the rear and keeping up this movement. The arrangement seemed to puzzle the enemy. I was in a hardware store. A young fellow was working. He had a pair of pliers and wanted to open catter pins. I took the pliers and said, ""Someone should invent pliers that when you squeeze down on them, the jaws would open up and open the catter pin."" I saw Al Lasko. He showed me his teeth. The front uppers fell out when he wanted them to. They flew out on the floor and then they flew back into place. He seemed to have a string attached to them. I said, ""Let me see your teeth,"" and he opened his mouth and I looked into it. He had an arrangement of a mirror in his mouth which showed teeth in his mouth all over. I was on a shanty. I let myself down by holding on the side of the roof. I was sitting on a box car. I moved it at east back or forth, then I put on the brake. I saw or heard Xippi Pigeon."
"0512"	"(01/01/57)"	"I saw a small animal with a long tail jump slowly. Then a dog started after it, jumped about 75 ft. at a leap and a spark or flash or fire came from its tail. I went outside. It was night and it was raining."
"0513"	"(01/02/57)"	"We were out driving with Carter at night. My lights would go out and it was dark. They would be out most of the time. We stopped by a friend of Carter's. I had on my old pants. I was embarrassed. We went to get some beer, but the brewery was closed because it was dark in the building. A sparrow flew on my shoulder. He was friendly. I held him on my hand. I came to a window and there were a lot of houseflies. He was having a feast on them. I watched him with his mouth open. The flies walked in and out, then he would eat them. I was on the street. I noticed a big tree was broken by a storm at night as we slept. Then I looked down by Renwood School and there lay a lot of big trees. One tree had the roots turned up and a house was tipped on one side by the roots of the tree."
"0514"	"(01/04/57)"	"I was at the track and I heard a fellow announce a horse. He said Brownser or something like it in the 2nd race ran 6th in the last race, but was going to win this one and the odds would be good. I played $5 on him, then won and paid over 20 to 1. I was going to be a conductor and a passenger train. I asked the lady what the fare was and she said 40 cents. I got a couple books of tickets. I put them in my shirt pocket and they were heavy like lead. We were in a lady's home whom we thought made counterfeit money. Fisher, Ernie and I pushed on a new brick wall of mortar and we tipped it over and down. Then we pushed it back up."
"0515"	"(01/05/57)"	"I looked at the price that was paid for Christmas trees in the shop and it was marked $25. I watched a procession. I was guard of a school class which was to go on strike. I was to keep the children from going home. I commanded them to stay in when they wanted to go out. I commanded all doors be closed. I was helped with the doors by my brother Steve. I pinched my fingers on two of the doors. I had to pull them out. This was an affair which I didn't understand, nor did I like it."
"0516"	"(01/06/57)"	"I saw my brother Joe (deceased) given a tube to recuperate and blood squirted on Ann's legs from him. Then his tongue stuck out and he was like gagging."
"0517"	"(01/08/57)"	"Carter and I went hunting. I saw a crow fly by. I was going to shoot him, but Bob said it was not a crow. I looked at a clock and it was 4 o'clock afternoon and only 1 hour to hunt. I saw a young man batting a bottle which some kids were pitching to him. I said, ""Don't you know you will break the bottle and the glass will be dangerous lying around?"""
"0518"	"(01/08/57)"	"We set out three different items outside and it was stolen each day.  We were being attacked by bandits. One of them was sneaking up to the window. We were shooting. He sneaked up and stuck in his head. I hit him on the head with my rifle stock and in he came. It seemed to be a friend of ours. We looked at different guns. He picked one up and said he liked the stock of this one. I looked at it and pointed it at a target, which was above a stairway. The sight was big and it covered all of a small target. I didn't shoot because I said someone could walk up to the top of those stairs just as I shot and I could shoot them, and sure enough someone did, some children. So I pointed the gun at any there target and I noticed some children around this tree, so I didn't shoot again. I didn't want to frighten the children. The sun was shining."
"0519"	"(01/09/57)"	"I looked and saw trees broken off and the wind was blowing. One tree was burning. It was fanned by the wind and the bark burned very fast. A fruit stand was near and he closed up on account of the wind. Ann had a novelty skirt. She put it on and a penis stood up on the skirt. A girl had a school case. It was searched for some object that people thought was in it. Brother Steve and I looked it over and finally found a secret zipper compartment. I opened it and found a pencil, loose change and other objects. I looked into a small lake. There were a couple balls in it. I waded in to get one of them and the ball like magic moved out of my reach two times, so I let it alone."
"0520"	"(01/10/57)"	"I was going to my car at night and an attorney was with me. I said, ""Your son is in my car and I saw other men with him,"" so I said for him to go back and get a gun, which he did. As I got nearer, I saw the men get out of the car and I went to the side where they couldn't see me. One had a rifle. I ducked on the ground behind the earth. I thought he was going to shoot my way. Then I got away and flew up near them and they were in our house. I sneaked near the window. Then I got into the house. Two of them came into the room They seemed to be drunk. I hit one and he went down. The other one fell, but was going to get up. I hit him also. One pulled a gun out of his pocket, was pointing it at me. I took the gun and searched their pockets. Ann came in and said they were alright. I noticed she was not afraid or nervous. We went by Tony Marolt's at night. It seemed closing time because the tables were dirty, so I put something on the table and we sat beside one. We had a party, some people from our old neighborhood were there. We drank up all the whiskey. I was driving and someone said Carter passed me up. I wanted to catch him, so I stepped on the gas. I stood up and went ahead without holding the wheel. It dawned on me, so I got hold of the steering wheel. I seemed to be going thru a tunnel or thru something I can't recall now."
"0521"	"(01/10/57)"	"I went to the Iron Kettle to bowl. When I got there, I was surprised to see a big lake come up to it. People were throwing rings into the water and the young ones were diving and jumping into the water for the rings. There were waves capping in also. There was a colored nurse who was Maleta. I was helping a doctor or assistant to him. The colored nurse winked at the doctor to make him, but he shook his head negative. Then she winked at me and I said no. So she didn't feel disgusted, but smiled and said she would keep trying till she made someone."
"0522"	"(01/11/57)"	"I looked at the paper and saw 334 or 344 just at a glance for bonds. Andy P. was building to his house. He had fresh concrete on a wall and was troweling it out fast before it got hard. I was going to replace some old part of my basement. Ann and I were in the basement. She was laying nude and I was tempted to do it to her, but I resisted her advances. Ann and I were to meet again and I waited for her, but when we met, there was someone around. I had a funny loose and low seat in my car. I was getting ready to drive it. Cousin Helen had a small dog. He did his business on the floor in two rooms and so much you wouldn't think a small dog could do so much."
"0523"	"(01/12/57)"	"I was supposed to be a cow. I was with another cow and a bull came up and tried to attack us, but we seemed to get away. We watched a dog act. He picked up a dagger and rode on a boy's back. He came at Bob and me and attacked us. I fought with him, got the dagger from him. I was so angry at the dog that I had him down and was going to stab him with the dagger and kill him, then I let him go. Bob and I had a few small cuts on our faces and hands. We went over to see the owner of the dog and let him know. He said, ""Why didn't you call the police?"" I was at the track. Met Joe G. and a few other boys there. They asked me to look at a race and see which one I would like. Heard Joe say a name he liked to one of the boys. I liked the same one and named it. It seemed to be a long name, but I can't recall it now."
"0524"	"(01/13/57)"	"We seemed to be living in the dark ancient ages. It seemed to be dark always. I saw a boat going down a narrow river. The boat was long and narrow and the occupants were dressed in white ancient armor suits. I was in school and went to the men's room where all the men were. I had a hard-on and missed the bowl. One friend said, ""You work so and hold back, that's why you are that way."" I disagreed with him. I saw one bridge built on a narrow street and another overhead covered bridge was being built. The women civic leaders were brought in front of me and introduced to me. I had a wire attached to some do-hickey and when I touched the two contact wires, there were sparks or contact of electricity."
"0525"	"(01/15/57)"	"Ann and I were in a cafe. She got up and was in the washroom. When she came back, she sat near a drunk and he was putting his arms around her waist. But I said, ""Hey, none of that stuff,"" and Ann came over by me. I bawled her out for sitting there. She said she thought she was beside me. We walked along a river bank. I got on the other side and walked. I saw Ann on the other side. She had on a blue dress and looked beautiful. I looked for a place to cross where it was shallow. I was right across from Ann. She went into the water and went under. I stood ready to go after her if she didn't come up, but she came up and had on that blue dress. I finally crossed and we walked together. Then we were going for the ocean. We came to a creek that was dry. We walked on the bottom. There was a boat on dry land and then it got muddy. We walked a little way and there was another boat and water enough to float on. I did a little repair on the boat and we were going to go to town on the boat. Audrey, Bob and Barb's son were with us. He was always under the water, he liked it so. We were in a place where there was an alligator. The little boy was with us and the alligator was after the boy. I held him. Ann gave the alligator something to eat. As he did so, I said, ""Put the glass between his jaws,"" and I pulled away the boy. Then she put the glass between his jaws again and we got away. He had his jaws open and we had to do this to keep him from swallowing the boy."
"0526"	"(01/16/57)"	"I was going to repair a bird cage with two tropical birds. I put it on the ground wrong side up, which was open, and one bird took off, escaped. He flew for the trees and a taillight like flashed as he flew. The other bird was ready to fly and I grabbed him in my hand and he turned into a fly. I put him down and flies started to buzz."
"0527"	"(01/17/57)"	"I came into the house thru the side door. When I was going out again, I noticed the door was unlocked and ajar a little. I thought someone might have come into the house. So I went down to the basement and looked into the fruit bin. I noticed the door was ajar there also. So I thought some stranger was in there. I got hold of the door to shut in the person and he pushed out and I pushed the door in. I finally got the door shut. I tried to yell for help upstairs, but I couldn't yell. Then I got an object in my hand and I opened the door and looked in cautiously. I saw a little man there. He was going to resist me, so I hit him on the head with the club and he sat down. Then I found out he was a dp and had no place to shelter, so I said he could shelter here. I was replacing some bricks from a building. I went down and picked up a couple bricks, then went up and put them on the wall. I was sort of stealing them."
"0528"	"(01/18/57)"	"We went visiting friends. I went home for something and I found someone was ransacking or robbing our home. There were clothes in the floor from the clothes closet. I looked up the stairway and there was a young fellow who was robbing us. I knocked him down and out. Then I went to call Ann, but I couldn't get her. I was going to call the police and I saw one man with a gun above a man down. He was pointing the gun to shoot him. I ran at him to save the man and he took off when I got near. Then the phone rang and a small girl was talking, calling me daddy. He name was Aggie. I said, ""You have the wrong party,"" and I hung up. A friend of mine came to see me. I told him that I was thru believing or rather agreeing with their untruths that they told me. He said, ""Would you be able to work 14 hours a day?"" I said yes, I could if I wanted to. We were preparing for someone's wedding, a friend's."
"0529"	"(12/04/57)"	"Fisher and I got a job in a steel mill, but it didn't last. Fisher got another job in another steel mill, so I went to see O'Neal who was personnel manager, but he said he was full. But he said, ""Come in with your working clothes at 11 pm and we will see what we can do."" So I did and he put me on as a helper and I pushed out trucks from the hot room, then closed the door. Then I helped another fellow and my job was done. I was laid off."
"0530"	"(12/05/57)"	"I was trying to pass around two girls on a path. I hit the deep snow and fell into it. As I was getting up, a colored man goosed me, then tried to stick his finger into my rectum. I tried to break him loose from his hold, but I didn't seem to have any strength to push him away."
"0531"	"(12/05/57)"	"We were in PA. I went into our front room in the dark and looked thru the door. I saw four young men. I yelled at them what they wanted and they didn't hear me. I knocked on the door and yelled out, ""What do you want?"" and they answered nothing. I looked thru the side window in the kitchen and I saw two boys sneaking by the windows. It was thundering outside. I could hear a storm coming. It was still night. We were sitting in the kitchen. Ann brought some drinks. Carter took one and I reached for one and I got a small tray with liquid in it. I was going to drink it and Ann said no. So I spilled it on my shirt and necktie. I said, ""Are you satisfied now?"" I got up, picked up a rag and there were a lot of rags tied to it because I pulled and pulled up rags and finally gave up and threw them down the stairway. I put on a light in the kitchen and it wouldn't light. I looked into the lamp and there was a couple burned and melted candles filling the sockets and no bulb. Ann got a bulb and turned it thru the wax into the socket. I turned the switch and the lampshade began to swell. I shut it off. Someone was looking at the entries. I looked and the print was small and I saw a pair of human eyes drawn above the entries."
"0532"	"(12/07/57)"	"My granddaughter was only about 4 days old and she got into an airplane and flew it, then crashed and didn't get hurt. She became  wise. She talked and said in front of her mother that she loved Grandpa more than anyone else. We were very friendly and I loved her. There was a reporter came over and wanted to get the story from me to put into the paper."
"0533"	"(12/08/57)"	"We were given a number by the church and the #501 was ours. Ann said some of the new parishioners only had to donate $2 a year. We received our envelopes and it came in a wooden box about the size of 12 x 16 x 6. One of the kids got on the express wagon and the man said, ""Stick em up."" The kid put up his hands and the man said, ""No, that is not the danger. We do not do that."""
"0534"	"(12/09/57)"	"I was hanging around a bridge where there was a creek. It was raining because the creek was running deep and muddy. Then it would get low. Then I looked at it and it was getting deep. Then I noticed or I flew away from the creek. The water started to flow the opposite direction and then I felt an earthquake. The ground shook. I saw cracks in the earth and trees and buildings started to collapse. I was in flight, flying away from danger so nothing would fall on me. I finally got out into the country. I heard a boy say Sunshine, that's a racetrack in Florida. I was working at White's and I said, ""Now how am I going to get to work from this job on time for the other?"" but I was working the 3rd shift at Dills and I could make it from job to job. I was with Bob, sitting on the curb, and I saw a pencil. I wrote with it and it was blue. I asked Bob if he wanted it and he said no."
"0535"	"(12/10/57)"	"I saw two men fighting. Then they were stubborn and neither wanted to give in that he lost the fight."
"0536"	"(12/12/57)"	"I was shopping and I saw small bars of naphtha soap. They were marked. I took five and when I counted them, there were 4 bars and a few slices of bacon between the 4 bars of soap."
"0537"	"(12/13/57)"	"I got a form and I saw some results, but can't recall them now. I was looking thru the window and saw Jackie and some girls talking outside. Her mother was in the room with me and I didn't know it till I turned around and saw her."
"0538"	"(12/16/57)"	"There was a collector from the church and there was $15,000. I was given a check to deliver the money, but I didn't see the check or the money. I went to our home, which was in the country. It was night and I was sort of afraid when near the house of a holdup."
"0539"	"(12/17/57)"	"I was walking along and a small boy was ready to kick me. I got angry and said, ""If you do, I will knock your block off."" He was afraid of me and didn't do it. I followed him into the bakery and when I was in there, I noticed I was in the wrong place. It was no bakery. It was a private home. I told the lady what a brat the kid was. He was ready to kick me, but was afraid when I threatened to hit him. I heard backfire. I looked into the toilet and saw a sheet of newspaper."
"0540"	"(12/18/57)"	"The fellows were picking on me. They said I was old and they would have an easy time to fight me. I was thinking, ""Why should I fight and get beat up?"" One heavyset guy was ribbing me so that I started to fight with him and I punched him in the stomach and in the body. He was curling up and didn't have a chance to hit me. He gave up. I was the winner. Ed and Tom Lasko were thinking of me as an old has-been. I told them all I needed was a little practice and I would be fairly good at baseball. I was working at White's on the washer job. It went around and up on a conveyor. I was by Charley C's home. One of his hot water tanks was blocked and getting up pressure in steam. He released the pressure by opening up the valve and letting out the steam and hot water. Some bullets were on a bonfire, and they were exploding. Fisher and I got a card to get a different job. We went by and I wore a cap. I took it off and showed it to Fisher. When we got there, I looked for my transfer or paper for the job and I pulled out money bills out of my pocket and I forgot my card in my other jacket and I also forgot my lunch. There were hillbillies waiting and some of the girls were lying on the floor. I told the man I forgot my card and he said he couldn't give me the job. I asked him if it was alright if I went down and got another card and he wouldn't answer. Then he turned out to be a lady. I was riding a bicycle on the St. Claire sidewalks. It was dark. I parked it and went in to see the Jew who was at the head of the working gang. I asked him how much the pay was and he said it depends on what you are doing, what kind of job. When I came out, my bicycle was a wagon and a horse. Dogs were barking at my horse and he was backing up. I got on the wagon and released the brake. It went back, then I applied it and it didn't hold very good. But I put it on and off."
"0541"	"(12/19/57)"	"3-1 and I think 5 I hear out of 7 numbers. Someone I know, I can't recall now, was talking of winning on horses and he said he won $15,000 last year. He had two winners and I know I had them with him. I had $30 or $40 coming. I hid in the front room in Rivertown and I was looking out the window watching Grandma and some other woman talking on our porch. I picked up a plate and it broke where I got hold of it. I counted 5 pieces."
"0542"	"(12/20/57)"	"I waded thru water knee deep across the street. I passed a basket above water. There were bees around it. I heard a baby crying in the basket. I was riding my bicycle. It was dark, night and my headlight would go off and on. There were a lot of crates of bananas on the sidewalk. I walked into a store and by a woman customer and the first thing I knew I was snagged with some string. I was unraveling it and the woman was also tied with the string. I was unraveling the string from my rosary."
"0543"	"(12/21/57)"	"I was doing a fellow a favor with Joe A. We took the blame for a murder charge. We were supposed to be exonerated but the fellow who did it was a politician and was going to let it go, and we would be really guilty. Joe had an angle which would prove that the man framing was the guilty one. When this man found out, he put his henchmen on us. We went in flight and were chased and pursued. We ran and walked up hill and down thru cornfields of fodder, stocks. The pursuers were so close that they were about 100 ft. behind. They had swords. One of the swords fell down a small cliff. I picked it up and threatened the pursuers with it and they ran back. Then we went on our flight again thru cornfields, over a hill and then down. Now it was Bob, Jerry and I who were being pursued. I had my car parked in a big garage. There were other cars there. I told a woman, ""Look at my car, how rusty it is, and at the holes in it."" I had another car. There it was, a new Lincoln. It was mine and still not. It started to back up and ran into a parked car, but just hit the bumper and did no damage. I saw a lot of beautiful pottery. I was swinging on a swing. I pulled myself up the rope, up the tree to where there was a caterpillar. He picked up some kind of small bottle and oozed out a white matter and it expanded like foam. Then a spider came out and put his jaws around the caterpillar, but didn't harm him. Peter A. was supposed to be in a hospital. Helen Solander was here and I talked to her. Bob and I were sweeping or cleaning up. I looked at the wallpaper. There were ash spots all over the walls and ceiling. I asked Bob who did that and he wouldn't say anything. So I said, ""I know who did that. It was Jerry."" Jerry came in and I was getting angrier and angrier till I flew off the handle and I started to cuss and yell at Jerry. I told him to get out and stay away from here. As I was pulling myself up the rope, my little granddaughter was hanging onto me."
"0544"	"(12/23/57)"	"I was at the race track betting on a horse by the name of Bob's Birthday. It was a $25,000 race. But there seemed to be no rider and they wanted me to ride him. I never rode a horse in my life and I was nervous. I thought of falling off and I also thought I would win my race and bet. There was a man that was a rowdy. He teased everyone, especially me. He finally had me, a policeman put him in jail. He was angry, but that seemed to be the only cure for him. I had some kind of contraption that had a handle on it or it was glass squares attached to a slingshot handle and inside these glass squares there were rocks or stones. I was looking at them and couldn't make it out, what it was. I was waiting for a streetcar in Fairchance, PA. One was coming, so I hurried to the stop. When it stopped, there was a crowd waiting to get on and they all got ahead of me. I thought I would change my position and get on the car sooner, but I ended up with some kids marching by from school, so I went back to the old crowd. I was looking for the men's room and there were mostly women in the rooms. I was changing my pants, had them off when a woman came in. I hid my legs behind a corner or wall. Then I got to my locker and changed my pants. I was late when I came to where this woman was and she was still there with a clean pair of slacks on. I patted her on the rump as I went by."
"0545"	"(12/24/57)"	"I was sitting on the front porch floor against the side of the house. The wind started to blow. It blew steady. It seemed like 100 per hour, stopped, then came again. John Mitchkash was sitting on a cart eating his lunch and all at once his cart started to move and he jumped off and let the cart go. The wind stopped and I went to the back yard, looked up at the sky and there was a sunrise decoration on the sky, not too beautiful. I said to one of the men working, ""I talked to the wind. I said, ÔWhy don't you blow again?'"" I saw a big cat walking along the street. It was sort of like a red color and was as big as a mountain lion. I yelled at the kid who was walking up to the cat to pet it. Ann said, ""That is a domestic cat. It won't hurt you."" It walked back towards us and up to me. It got up against me with its front paws and licked my face. I closed my eyes as it did so."
"0546"	"(12/25/57)"	"I was driving my car. I stopped in the dark and someone put his hands thru the wing and got hold of my hands and held them. Then I was finally released. I told Ann, she got a gun and was going to carry it for protection. I said I was going to do the same. We were in the colored neighborhood and they hated us. We were sitting on the couch and then we lay down because someone was trying to get us. I had some kind of power. I pointed my finger and a liquid of fire came out and went against the glass about 50 ft. away. I was pointing at a man outside who was after us. Then we walked along the street. I had a pistol and warned the people I would shoot anyone who would try to stop my wife or me. I looked around and my wife was down. A grey-headed woman was on top of her. I ran over and made her get off. I called her names. I met a friend of mine who was going with me to save one of our friends, which were me and my wife, who were being attacked in our home. I flew up and was like Superman. There were the shady characters who were after me to stop me. I just pointed my finger and the power of suggestion stopped them. We were driving and the windshield and street froze up. It had a thin coat of ice. We couldn't make the hill. I walked up on the ice and went to the top. I was taking some kind of test or examination. It was something about Ann. I can't recall it now. There was a long roll of paper and there were some signs and printing on it."
"0547"	"(12/26/57)"	"I was working at Dills. I operated 7 machines. They were in a row, but seemed to be far apart. By the time I loaded one line and checked them, about 4 were running empty. I didn't like it. I kept working till a truck driver from White's called out, ""John Evans you can take your lunch whenever you want now."" So I took my lunch. A bad man was after me always teasing me and insulting. I was not afraid of him, but I just let him go on. One day he was coming and my fellow workers told me of him. I didn't get out of his way. He was surprised, but came at me. I stood my ground and I put my power mastery of mine at him. I stopped his horse, which he tried to run me over with. I did it with my mastery of commanding my power to stop him. Then I commanded him to back up and he came to the edge of the cut of the coke yard. I then made him back over the edge with his bad master, which he did and it was the end of him. I later made myself nude and there were nude men and women coming with me up a stairway. I saw a young female coming up. I gabbed her and hugged her and the first thing I knew, I had intimated her and she was pregnant. I asked her where she stayed, and she said she lived in a chicken coop. I said, ""You will live in my quarters from now on. I saw Benny, the 2nd shift foreman, coming down the track with a rifle on his shoulder. He was guarding me when I was out in the wilds and I didn't know he was with me. I was varnishing a large building instead of painting the outside. I was on top of the building. I looked down on the side I had to varnish, and it was high. I wondered if I would be afraid to varnish at such a height."
"0548"	"(12/27/57)"	"I saw a winner in the first race. $8.60. I can't recall it."
"0549"	"(12/28/57)"	"I picked some horses and I was surprised they didn't win. I noticed one out. I thought it was a sure winner, but it didn't win. I can't recall the others now. I sneaked up and stole some cheese in big slices and some grapes and put them beside Frank Zupanik. I was like in the army. We had a lady cornered in her room with a machine gun. She was against us. I sneaked into her room and hid behind the davenport and gave my friends the high sign when the woman arrived from being out. The boys opened fire on her and we captured her. I was watching two armies come close to each other and one didn't know of the other being there. One had nude women with the men. The American men would see one of the women put a bayonet against her back and make her go down underground and pull the cover over her. They seemed to have holes in the ground. Bob was diving thru the air and another big kid ran in front of him and they both went down. I ran over and thought Bob was hurt, but he was stunned, but not hurt. I bawled out the kid for what he did. I picked about 11 horses on paper and when I was going to bed, I asked myself subconsciously which horse would be a sure winner and Outrank seemed to come to me and come to me, that I was repeating it over and over. This was in waking stage, not asleep. It was after midnight and it was the 28th."
"0550"	"(12/30/57)"	"Five of a kind was picked and was called Bepson. I dreamed of the objects of five a few times in my sleep. I was working with the White Sewing Machine Co."
"0551"	"(12/31/57)"	"I was in the back yard and there were 3 big tricycles. I was going to ride one. There was a mouse running around on the lawn and I was going to step on him. I finally stepped on him and when I looked in the grass for him, all I found was grasshoppers that were dead. I was flying low with Audrey and her girlfriend. Audrey gave me some gold. I flew to a dead end in a building twice. There were homes on fire. People were standing and watching them. As I came to the fire I saw another fire and no one knew about it. I told the crowd about it, so we went to it and put it out."
"0552"	"(01/02/58)"	"I looked in the paper and saw Come Through entered in the first race."
"0553"	"(01/03/58)"	"I was back at White's in the old plant. I was to grind some bars and I found there were 3 sizes mixed, so I matched each bar and sorted them out. When I was thru, I told Joe I was thru, but I didn't grind them. I changed my clothes and looked at the time, and I had about 15 minutes left. I thought I could finish them, but it was not enough time. I saw a fellow next door which was John Kell (deceased). I walked up to him and said, ""Aren't you John Kell?"" but when I got near him, I noticed he looked different and he said he was not."
"0554"	"(01/04/58)"	"I was lying on the floor. A lady came by. She lay on top of me and I intimated her. I sat in the house and looked on the porch. A chair moved up off the floor and I commanded it to stop in mid air and it did. Then I commanded it go near the ceiling and it did. Then my sister Ann was standing on the porch. I commanded she go up off the floor. She did, then I commanded her to stop in mid air and she did. I made her body go near the ceiling, and it did. I made her body turn in mid air and it did. There were two doctors taking blood or draining blood out of each other. They had a cavity in their hands and had tubes to drain the blood out and it made me nervous to see them spill the blood into the sink."
"0555"	"(01/06/58)"	"There was a big snowstorm. When I came outside, I had to dig the car out. I mean the windshield was covered thick. I looked for a letter to appear and I thought it was going to be a three, but it came on clear and it was E. My sister Mary and I were going home from work. I was not working for White Sewing Machine Co. I met her. There was a grade going down and it was icy. We sort of skated or slid on the ice. I held her and we slid downhill using our shoes like skates. There was a pile of apples peeled on the ground. I picked one up and was going to eat it when a boy said, ""You have to buy it. Climb up that tree and pay for it."" I looked up and there was a row of men going up. I went up part way and then everybody was climbing down. They were afraid someone would fall from the top on them. I also climbed down. I was running up and up and Scout our dog was with me. There was a piece of wire that was always in my way, so I bent it and threw it on a side out of my way. Bob and I were up in a building and Uncle Mike (deceased) was there. Then his son Mike swung on a swing and was to jump, but fell on the floor. I was climbing up with Andy P. up beams like we got to the top. I was wading thru water, then I swam part of the way."
"0556"	"(01/08/58)"	"I saw Easter Morning in the paper. I crawled into an oven and put some coal on the two sides where there was a fire. Margie, my sister, was getting married. We swept the street where a parade was to start."
"0557"	"(01/09/58)"	"My dad was to come into the school house. He was to give me a bird whistle. I heard one and went to the window and saw my dad coming into the building."
"0558"	"(01/09/58)"	"I was working with Red. We were cleaning and piling up in a junkyard. I was kicking football with another man. Red and I walked around a pond and there were a lot of snakes around it. I got a razor sharp dagger and I went around and cut the snakes in two. One of them was ready to bite me when I cut him in two. I was in the country. I looked at the beautiful trees and fields. A fellow told me, ""I'm going to give you the best selection today, Evans."""
"0559"	"(01/10/58)"	"Loddie and I were looking over some chasers to grind to make a thread for a missile part. I held one missile up and had another beside me. The moon seemed to be so close, it seemed the other missile would touch it. The USA seemed to have a missile that would put people on the moon. I looked up at the moon and it seemed to be only about 15 ft. high or above me. We landed on some barren land. It seemed like another planet. We got company because there seemed to be other countries that came there also. I watched a lady and man work some new invention of the USA, a sort of typing apparatus."
"0560"	"(01/11/58)"	"I was sitting in a car with a school mate, Hazel. I looked at her, then took her into my arms and loved her up. We were ready to go when a lady came up, a woman who I sold a sewing machine to. She came up to me and came near my face and whispered into my ear, that she got a notice to pay for her machine, if she could make payments on it, but I said, ""I don't think so."" Then she said, ""They will take my machine away from me or my husband will go to jail."" I said, ""Yes, they can do that."" So she gave me some money to pay it. I counted the money, a twenty, and I couldn't make out the other bills. They were in plastic bags. One bag was empty."
"0561"	"(01/13/58)"	"We looked at the results and a sail horse won the big race. I said why he won the last one. Ann said she played and if there was a 29, she would win. I was working at White's again and Peter A. came in and he had two big bugs in jars. They must have been about 8 or 10 inches long and about 3 inches in diameter. He said he was not feeling good because he worked too many hours. I saw ""whence"" by itself in the paper at the end of a sentence or it was alone. I wanted to dream if Star Boots was going to win today and someone gave me a $7 bill, which there is no such bill, but Evans had a 7 in one way. I had it on the ticket. A fellow was sitting on a horse. Walter Unger came by, made a pass at the horse and the horse went backwards thru a crowd and no one was trampled on. I saw a man lying on the street like dead and two fellows were standing near him. Then I looked again and the man that was stretched out on the street was standing up."
"0562"	"(01/14/58)"	"I looked for a snow horse because I thought of one and on glass I scratched with my nail and snow man or snow appeared on the glass. There was a lot of snow on the ground. Bob was riding his bicycle and he had the seat or rear end somehow turned up where it would interfere with his rear view. I looked up into a tree and there was a pigeon sitting on a branch right above me. I moved away for fear the droppings would fall on me. I was flying or sort of floating in the air above the doorway by the ceiling. I floated downstairs to where Bob sat and at him, but he was doing breathing exercise and paid no heed to me. Then I was in bed. Something seemed to surround me and sort of put a pressure around my body that I thought I wouldn't be able to move, but I tried to raise up and I did, overpowered it and it turned out to be a woman in my bed. I got on top of her and intimated her. She got up and went into the other room, but I held onto her dress that was so long. I towed or pulled it in and pulled her back. She seemed to be my wife and still not. I got on top of her and intimated her again."
"0563"	"(01/15/58)"	"I was trying some kind of cylinders and then I was asked how some of them did and a fellow answered on one of them that Jutland gave it a tussle or beat it. He didn't say."
"0564"	"(01/16/58)"	"We had a party and we invited Rose Lasko. She didn't show up. I walked by the window and looked out and was surprised to see Rose across the lot sitting beside the window looking at me. I didn't know that her house was there. Ann was sitting near the window. I told her to look and she would see Rose. Later she said she saw her. I said, ""You moved your head slowly just around the corner of the window, so one eye came in contact with Rose's window and you saw her."" She smiled. I looked again and I saw Rose and two of her lady friends in her home. I told Ann she must have a party of her own. That's the reason she didn't come to ours. I was working at Dill's pulling the barrels into some other assembly parts, which some of the barrels were oversize."
"0565"	"(01/16/58)"	"I was in the old screw dept. in the flats. I was going to the locker room. The lights were dim. It was night. As I got near the locker room, it dawned on me that it was vacant of lockers. All there was, the two-sheet metal walls. As I came to the doorway entrance, I just looked in and it was dark. I started back to my machines and I heard a bugle blowing and I awoke and I heard that on our TV. I was in Rivertown. I walked thru a field familiar to my boyhood days. I walked past a couple boys with a dog. When the dog saw me, he came at me barking. I kept an eye on him and I talked to him that I wouldn't hit him. He walked along and all at once I got an urge to hit him, which I did. After that I was remorseful. I apologized and said he should not worry. I wouldn't do it again. I walked along with a paper under my arm. I was thinking that I could have been a big league baseball star. If I was young again, I would be a real star. I would work like a beaver to attain my goal. I just heard a fellow say that X was his. I can't remember what we were discussing. The fellow said, ""Give me X."""
"0566"	"(01/17/58)"	"I saw Varginia C. in front of one of the horses."
"0567"	"(01/18/58)"	"I climbed on the roof of a barn. The roof was on fire. We were extinguishing it."
"0568"	"(01/19/58)"	"My wife Ann changed her clothes. She was nude where my friends could see her on two occasions. Frank Kogler was walking with me. All at once he put his fingers into my mouth and pulled my filling loose from my front tooth. I was with a group or party of friends and relatives. It was a wedding party. I was told to go see M. Monahan."
"0569"	"(01/20/58)"	"I was flying around with speed, sort of gliding thru the air. I watched a new game being played. Bill Grove was playing the new game. I heard a fellow say, ""He Comes"" when I asked for a name of a horse that will win. I heard ""taste."" I was floating on the water on a boat, but all it was, was a piece of wood about 3 inches wide and about 2 _ feet long. I sat on it and floated around and still I was not in the water. I was shoveling coal on a pile. George from Whittington was at our house. Then he relaxed on a cot. I wanted to get an answer if Told You So would win his race. I was talking to a smart fellow who thought he knew his horses. So I asked him if he was so smart to give me a horse that will win today, and he said He Comes or it could be He Could. I'm almost positive it was He Comes. This I figured was the answer to told you so. Champ Sorter came to me as a winner."
"0570"	"(01/20/58)"	"I was trying to find out if Turf Pic would win his next race and I heard almost."
"0571"	"(01/21/58)"	"I was working some kind of machinery and it seemed leaves had some bearing on it or there were leaves around the leavers continuously."
"0572"	"(01/22/58)"	"I went down to see the boys in the flats, my friends or fellow workers I worked with over 30 years. I saw a foreman setting up a turret lathe. He was driving flat pieces of steel on pins on a big Chuck. Then one of his many oil nipples was clogging, but he finally got it going. I met Laddie and Charles C. I talked with them. Charles was up near the rafters and so was I. I sort of slipped and grabbed for a ladder, which was up past Charles. I yelled at Charles, ""Get hold of it because I'm going to slide it down to the main hits right and stops,"" which it did and we climbed down. Charles made a flip over on the ladder and then climbed down. He was dressed clean and then he stuck out his chest. I said, ""Are you boss now or did you change clothes so early?"" He put his finger up to his lips to be quiet. I later was taking out some chips to one of the trucks outside in a shovel. I met Cecilia Lippert outside. She was talking to a friend and said, ""I haven't got it."" I spoke up, ""Can I look and see if I can find it on you?"" Her face got red. She blushed and so did I. I looked at a car parking near and a policeman was watching us. I was going to go talk to her, but she now sat in a car with a small baby in her arms and a lady sat in the rear seat of the car. Bob and I were in church."
"0573"	"(01/22/58)"	"I saw a lot of airplanes in a port and they had propellers under the wings and one under the tail. These propellers acted as a helicopter. They would take off straight up and then land, settle down like a helicopter. I looked out and saw a big plane moving. I said, ""That plane will have no space to take off,"" but Ann said, ""It has the whole airstrip to start on."" She was right. I looked out to the distance to see if the plane took off and way off at a distance I saw a plane bouncing on the ground. Ann was picking out a horse. She pointed and said, ""Bold Some,"" and another one I can't recall."
"0574"	"(01/23/58)"	"I was at the race track. I saw the board when the race was going and I saw the PP numbers coming up. It ended with W first and there was another two about 5th or 6th, so they changed pp 7 win. I wanted to know who was going to win the 7th race at Hialeah today. I was standing beside a barn or something looking in. It was loaded with all kinds of animals. They were running in and out of their compartments."
"0575"	"(01/23/58)"	"Ann gave me a strip of pool tickets and the name of the tickets were some."
"0576"	"(01/24/58)"	"A bird was carrying off a young one flying away with it. The baby was squawking. He was a different bird stealing the young one. I was working at White's. I saw and talked to Margie. On two occasions I asked credit for one job, which was two halves of a piece."
"0577"	"(01/25/58)"	"We were playing ball and were beating the other team. C. Charvat batted up. He hit one thru a window at White's. It broke the window and went inside. Charley ran around the bases. A kid came out with the ball and waited for Charles to come home. I got the ball from the kid and I told the kid to go to the home plate and I would throw the ball to him when Charles ran for home. So Charley came for home. I threw the ball to the kid. It was a little wide and he missed it. It rolled back. When Charles saw me with the ball, he ran back and the kid had time to get the ball. I was at a party of picnic. There were a couple small lakes. The water was clear, cool, and I could see the bottom and feel the coolness from the water. We were raided by police. I flew above one of the lakes and looked down into the clear water. I saw a tail wagging or swimming in the water."
"0578"	"(01/26/58)"	"Ann and I went camping with Carters. We made a campfire on two occasions. I found a lot of wood stick matches. I filled my pockets with them. Ann and Bernice walked across the ice over the Cuyahoga River. At White's we were taking home things the company didn't want. I found two large wooden boxes I wanted. I saw Horton walking by. I called to him and asked him to give me a requisition for the boxes. I met Bill S. and he said, ""If you take two boxes, they will open one and look it over. And if you take one box, they will look over the one."" I was puzzled for I wanted something in the box that I didn't want them to look over. I drove my car to where the boxes were and George G. and Bob had one up high on top of a ladder and it crashed to the ground, breaking apart. There was snow on the ground. I drove my car up a small bank and when I was going to back down the bank, there were about 4 concrete steps I had driven up."
"0579"	"(01/27/58)"	"There seemed to be an insight of an uprising. We were on St. Claire and E. 79th St. A large crowd was gathered. Two girls drove up in a jeep and threatened the crowd that if they started any trouble, they would replace this jeep into a cannon. So they went to work on the jeep and up came two cannon barrels which they said they would use if we started anything. The crowd started to disperse. I stayed and then went to look at the cannons. They seemed to be made of wood. I bought a pair of underwear, long ones, and after I had them on for a while, they seemed to be tight. I said, ""I bought them large enough, but they won't stretch."" I was working on the B and S and there seemed to be trouble. A fellow had a screwdriver with a round metal handle and it kept on rolling away from the job it was to be doing. Two of my machines were replaced with rebuilt ones or ones that had new, replaced parts. We were in St. Charles Church. I won a check prize and it was $10.00. It was the 2nd one out of the last 3 raffles. Come Through won and paid $23. I'm not quite sure it was this one, but I'm almost positive. Bob, two men, a woman and I were walking down a steep mountain trail. We got down so far and I changed my mind. Bob and I started back up the trail. It was steep. There was a railing on the trail and a cat went by us up the rail."
"0580"	"(01/28/58)"	"I saw Ehnce to Now Hear This in the entries. I seemed to be above the earth and saw an atomic explosion. Then I was back down on the earth driving a car on a highway. I was driving at a fair rate of speed, but some of the drivers were passing me at a high rate of speed. I seemed to be standing at their speed. I was wheel-barrowing some items and Bill Grove gave me a hand when I got sort of stalled."
"0581"	"(01/29/58)"	"I was in Russia with Bob. He was separated from me. I don't know how. I was walking thru a field near Stalingrad, a lady was walking with a dress on and a man in a shirt sleeves and I had a suit coat on and it was summer. I was worried about Bob, if I would find him ever and I had $40 which seemed to be enough money to get me home."
"0582"	"(01/30/58)"	"Tiger Flame came to me or I saw it as an entry."
"0583"	"(01/31/58)"	"I was with a fellow who came by and wanted to see the doctor. He just lived in the chapel of the church. As we came near, he started to yell, ""Hey, Son."" He repeated ""son"" about 4 times, then the door opened in the chapel and, it being dark, we couldn't see who it was. But we hurried to the door and when we went in, a mass was being served. We went into the other room and there also was mass. We walked thru outside and there were what I think were ex-jockeys and gamblers and horse trainers. This man introduced me to these fellows. I got up and shook hands with a colored man who seemed to be a trainer or stable boy. Then I sat down again and over went the seats with us. We lay there for a while. Then I got up and went over to another seat and the man introduced me to another fellow. His first name was Steve. I said mine was John. I said I maybe would play Steve and he said no, the same jockeys are going to win next week also. Then this one I can't recall is now not winning will be on the winning streak. I came into the kitchen nude and Grandma and sister Margie were there. I didn't seem to be ashamed, but I thought Ann would give me hell when they left."
"0584"	"(02/01/58)"	"I was working on the roof of a shanty. A man deceased came up there and said I owe him 60 cents for a pool ticket. I pulled out my wallet and out of my change section I had four square dollars. I said, ""Look what they make now, square dollars."" We were looking them over, seemed some of the square edges were a little different in O.D. a little, then others. I finally gave him one of the square dollars and he gave me the change. The water gutter was not draining properly. At the end of the spout it hit the ground and then squirted up into my face. I was trying to fix it so the water wouldn't go into the neighbor's yard because they called the police and that's why I was fixing it."
"0585"	"(02/02/58)"	"We were discussing race results. I asked who won the big races in San Anita today and I was told the name of a horse I can't recall now, but the other race the F. Field won and the fellow said that was a strong field. A stranger was walking by and overheard us and said, ""That's like when Snowman was running again. I was playing him on the last few races and one of my buddies said, 'Hey friend, your Snowman is running again. You better put a bundle on him,' and then he said, 'That's like throwing your money away,' but I took his razzing and played him that day and boy, did he pay a bundle."" I saw or heard Nobe Sun at sunshine."
"0586"	"(02/03/58)"	"I was eating a big peach. It was as large as a cantaloupe. I looked up into the tree and it was loaded with peaches that size. It was Muchchus in Rivertown and it was evening and they were going to bed. I was planning on getting a ladder and getting a big peach to take home for the kids."
"0587"	"(02/04/58)"	"I was working at White's. Dr. Conn was our doctor. Someone fell over the sweeper and we put on a telacall and called Dr. Conn. ""Dr. Conn, emergency, Dr. Conn, Dr. Conn."" The fellow and I were to write on our cards 3rd shift, which I did. There was another call over the telacall system by us. Bob was lost and we were searching for him. I had an idea we would find him dead, buried under something, or drowned. I thought of how he must of suffered before he died. I found a body, but it wasn't Bob. It was some fat, husky boy. He seemed to be dead and still alive. I left him with a boy and went on searching. Then the boy came up to me with the husky fellow I dug out and he was now just a skinny boy. I saw Bob Lippert sitting on a bench with a husky man. Bob was fat and chubby and had his fat elbow in the husky man's neck, sort of making him sit in an awkward position. I pulled up on a big cable which made some freight cars move. I then pushed it back and they stopped. Then the cars started again and went down the track and up a grade. The last car started back down and I was on the track. I had a hard time getting off the track, but I did and the boxcar came by me and then it went off the track and climbed a steep hill, went to the top and started back down with speed. It seemed to fall apart and the debris was scattered around."
"0588"	"(02/05/58)"	"I was in New York City, was working there with Fisher and Andy P. The streets were being remodeled. There was a deep cut in the center, which was for the trucks and heavy vehicles and the two upper sides was for the light traffic. The lower traffic had vehicles that would pick up any rubbish on the street at any time. We were walking along and Andy P. found himself a girlfriend. She was walking with us. I looked at her face. She was dark complected, had no makeup on. I passed Joe G. and didn't say anything to him, and he yelled, ""Hello, Evans."" So I looked back and said, ""Hello, Joe,"" and walked back and said, ""I didn't mean to be so rude. I was thinking about something and didn't see you."" He said the same thing happened to him, but his daughter told him about it and he came to. I was on 68th St. helping Rose Lasko with some work. I was going home with the boys when Rose called me. I said to the boys, ""You go. I'll be back later."" I came to Rose and wanted to kiss her, but she ran. I gave chase into one room. My father was there, and into another room, Ann's father was there. So into the third room, I got her into a corner and intimated her."
"0589"	"(02/05/58)"	"Joe Gruber was doing some kind of work putting springs on pins and this went thru hot water and a chemical. I helped him to put on some of the parts. When it came thru, I took off some of the springs. They now were small stretch springs and small nails."
"0590"	"(02/06/58)"	"I was operating the old B and S at White's. Haverlock was the foreman. I was running brass and steel jobs. It was dark night and all at once, I noticed the lights were out on my end of the shop and my machines were running. I started to work my way to the switchboard and put the lights on. I picked up some hex bars which were cut short and was going to run them out. I came around a corner and jumped back because an enormous dog's head came in front of me. It was a big dog. I later came in front of a dog again. I won some money at the track. There were some drawings on a big mirror and I was cleaning off the mirror so they could be seen clearly and Ann was going to curl the hair on the women. I spit on the mirror to dampen it so I could clean it."
"0591"	"(02/07/58)"	"Bob and I were walking on St. Claire. I thought I saw a wrist watch on the curb; sure enough, I picked it up and put it on my wrist. When we got home, I looked at it and listened to it run. It turned into a radio and when it ran, it moved on a track and there came a set of pottery jars with it. Also a long chain with it, and then it also squirted water and sort of shot flashes and made a noise like a gun. I seemed to be fighting with someone. I got hold of my penis and it came off my body. I held it in my hand like a cigar and also I was going to look thru it like a telescope."
"0592"	"(02/09/58)"	"I was in Farkas's yard, then went next door looking for our dog. They had small dogs that jumped over a 5 ft. fence. The man brought the female over and put her into my hands and I held her and patted her as she lay in my arms."
"0593"	"(02/10/58)"	"I was sitting in the car with Ann. She was practicing how to shift the gears when the motor was running. We were looking over homes, were looking for a room. We walked up so many steps, stairs, and always landed in the attic, like where it was small and on steps I was careful. We were at a livestock show. A small girl was reaching down into a pigpen and a big pig grabbed her hand. The girl screamed and Ann jumped into the pen. The pigs ran away and Ann saved the girl. Then another girl did the same and Ann boldly, bravely jumped in again and when she took out the girl, her head was just a hunk of flesh. No face recognizing and part of Ann's scalp was ripped off. We built a sort of roof shelter of old wood and it was quite sturdy. Ann Petrilis murdered her husband she acted as though she knew nothing of it. Then it seemed that it was my sister Mary murdered my dad and still it seemed that my mother was the one who was dead."
"0594"	"(02/11/58)"	"I was being chased by enemies. I was sort of going through crevices to between rock formations. One place I was below my pursuers and I threw lumps of coal at them so fast I routed them. I was going to a show at my boyhood school and one fellow said, ""Aren't they charging too much?"" and I said, ""They are here for the dough and that's all."" Hank Seegert was telling us some child was going to be a big man because his body was long."
"0595"	"(02/12/58)"	"We took a walk on a farm and there were two bulls. I went around the back to avoid them, but somehow they knew, but we got acquainted and the bulls were friendly. I was finishing or helping on some work at White's. Then we were on a farm again and some policeman came around and wanted to arrest us, but I happened to be outside with my shotgun and they found out and tried to coax me to surrender, but I held my ground. Then Bob came down to where I was and rolled a big ball of string to me. I was going to throw it up and shoot at it, but it was too heavy. Barbara came by and wanted to shoot a 20 gauge gun at a target and she did. When she shot, a long flame came out of her gun and it flamed like a torch as she went to look at the target. I said, ""Keep your gun up because the flame could ignite a fire."" I went into the house, bit I took the mud off my shoes and I said, ""I'm the only one who does that in our family."""
"0596"	"(02/13/58)"	"Fisher and I were driving. We were in the city, then hit the country. I asked him if he wanted to drive and he took the wheel for a while. Then we stopped because Fisher didn't want to drive on awhile on account of a muddy drive. He turned off and we came to a nice paved road. I took the wheel. I put on my shoes and we were on our way. I met my uncle and cousins. I stopped by a liquor store and John, my cousin, and two friends gave me a half pint of liquor for a gift. I thanked him for it. I lived in PA. The neighbor's toilet outside was running over, overflowing nad down the alley. It was filthy. I had a loaf of bread and the flies would land on it and I had to break a hunk of it off and throw it away. As I walked thru the field, I stepped into cow flops and had my shoes all over it. I walked thru the grass ti get it off and clean. We had a lot of tomatoes growing."
"0597"	"(02/14/58)"	"I was in an eating establishment. After I was through, I went to the rear room where there was whiskey. I had to squeeze thru a tight passage and when I got to the room, I saw an old lady there. I said I wanted a big shot. She looked in a book. It was like a map and she ran a paper on this map. She said, ""This is sunshine."" Then she came to a star and I said, ""Five star Hennessy."" I said, ""How much is it?"" and she said, ""Let's look at the map again."" So she got the paper and slid it by the bright shining. She said sun, then lower and I said, ""There is the star."" It was bright and larger than the stars around it. I saw sheep running away. Then she took the paper away and I could see the star shining. I saw a 1 mark move and stop over number 89. I have a thought I heard Come in my sleep."
"0598"	"(02/15/58)"	"I saw or heard Foolish Heart. I heard Po Po or Poe Poe. I heard someone calling for help, help, help. I went into the company store in Rivertown and opened the front door and motioned the manager to come. He came with a friend and his wife. I introduced myself to his friends. We went into the store. I was going to the races. It was the first day or opening day. Little Johnnie fell off the bed."
"0599"	"(02/15/58)"	"I saw a big guy get hit and he stayed up awhile and then slowly went down. When he came up, it was Louie Phetiel. He said, ""Who hit me?"" and he looked at me. I drew my arm back with a fist ready to hit him, and he moved away and was trying to find out who hit him."
"0600"	"(02/16/58)"	"I saw Come Through as winner. Then later I looked in the paper and I saw Come Through and it seemed like 2nd. Audrey stole a book and I was with her when we tried to get away from our pursuer, a girl. Audrey said, ""I am not running away anymore. I am returning the book."""
"0601"	"(02/16/58)"	"I was on a big ship on the ocean and there was a fleet of boats. We were maneuvering and we were in a straight line following each other. There was a line in the water from the other ship in front of me. The ship in front of me went over the horizon or a water bank and I followed close. Ann was on the ship in front of me. I reached over and touched her belly and Ann fell over on my feet. I seemed to be close to the water, low and sneaking up on Ann ahead of me."
"0602"	"(02/16/58)"	"I was making something to eat. I put a big ear of corn into the bowl and was taking off the corn with a spoon. I saw a land title letter on the table and I didn't like it because it was not a very good outfit to deal with, so I got hold of the letter and closed the door and was going to see what my dad did with the mortgage. We were surrounded by savages or an army of soldiers at war with us. Someone promised us a way of escape and we paid him and he was leading us to escape."
"0603"	"(02/18/58)"	"Winnie was telling Ann she was married to Jim Varga before she married me. I was there. Ann didn't like this. Winnie said they couldn't get along because Jim had his way and couldn't see it no other way. I wanted to ask Ann how did we get married in church if she was married before, but I couldn't get that question in. We went for a walk in Rivertown at night. It was near the high school. I saw two men lying on the ground. I told Ann, ""Now let's get away from here before these follows came after you."" We started away and one of the fellows came after us. I hit him and knocked him down. He got up and came again and I put him down again. Then it turned out I was going after a woman who was there and she had a knife. She tried to stab me, but I got the knife away from her and calmed her down. I went into a store and bought a cake. I thought I gave the lady a dime and it was a penny. It shined and I thought it was a dime. As I took my change, I had slugs or flat pieces of steel mixed with my money. When I was awaking, I was saying, ""I did."" I saw King Knight."
"0604"	"(02/19/58)"	"Bob and I went hunting. Bob said, ""I bet I get one."" We moved near the barn and up flew some quail. I pointed my gun at one, but didn't shoot. Bob shot and got one. We were inside the barn and he pointed his gun at something. I ran outside and looked and saw a robin come out. I pointed my gun at him, but didn't shoot. I looked at the time and it was 8 o'clock. I said, ""You boys better stop shooting because it is only 8 o'clock and hunting starts at 9 a.m."" I was at the foot of the mountains. I looked at them and said, ""I'm not going to climb up those mountains to hunt. That's too much work."" I was driving my car on different roads and through snow. I went to see John to see if he could come home at a certain time. He was piling up beer cases and said he would be working overtime because there was a lot of beer. Grandma put some steel stock on the rack. One bar was sticking out too far. I got hold of it and pulled on it because it was stuck under the rack. I pulled and loosened it. The bar was about 50 ft. long. Joe Hutter cut it shorter and put it in the rack."
"0605"	"(02/21/58)"	"I met Margie S. I took her hand and she loved it. I gave her a kiss and was it sweet. I was taking her into a dark place. We went into a shanty. There was a large building like a barn. I saw a nice spot to lay and be concealed from sight. Just as we got there and she laid down, from all directions fellows came crawling on their fours towards us. They were fellows that worked with me. We walked away embarrassed hand in hand. She said, ""You know I don't get it and I feel lazy, no pep. A woman has to have it once in a while."""
"0606"	"(02/21/58)"	"Joe Lasko was talking to me into my ear and hugging me, but I couldn't see him. He told me how much he loved me. I asked him a question how I could get rich and Ann and I would be happy, but he wouldn't answer. Bob was sleeping on the floor. I told him to sleep on the bed, and when he saw the bed, he went for it. He was sleeping next to Grandpa Lasko and he was snoring. I was playing some kind of game. I got a rubber ball. I bounced it against the wall and it kept bouncing till it stopped, but Albert came by and stopped it. I yelled at him to keep his hand off, but he didn't and I threw a peach at him, hitting him on the head. The flattened peach fell on the ground and the ball was also a flattened peach. There were 3 balls to choose from a box and the game cost 40 cents. I said all I would play was one ball. Famous Gift came to me in my sleep."
"0607"	"(02/22/58)"	"I was looking at shoe prints on the stairway. We could see a man come up and went down the stairway. I walked into a big room and at the other end of it there was a man finishing up his dressing. I said, ""Do you live here or did you just come in here?"" He said the same to me. I walked up to two other fellows and asked how they were doing, and one of them said he's doing good. He's got $9,500 coming on this race. I saw the results. It was like 9. 40. I looked good and then it seemed like 9. 04. I then could see it, 40. 40 was the results. I said, ""This sun shining on it makes it hard to see,"" and he was surprised when I said it was 40. 40. I saw Red Chip Bond winner."
"0608"	"(02/23/58)"	"I was in Dill Mfg. Co. I saw about 5 or 6 new machines they brought in. They had only the table and not the top. I inquired if we had to furnish them. I meant the tools on the machine, and was told no. Then later they had all the parts on the machines. John Sarino was shaking the front slide showing a lot of play in the slide. Ed McUnis was having open house, so I asked Kolesar if he had his address, and he gave me a piece of paper with his address on it. I had on a white shirt without a necktie and I very seldom wear a white shirt. I saw Pro as winner. I was in Frank's home and he had most of his window ropes broken on the window sills. I drove off without Ann, then noticed she was not with me. I drove back and she was waiting for me."
"0609"	"(02/24/58)"	"I was working for White Sewing Machine. My spindle was stalling. I looked up at belts and when I got up on a ladder and got hold of a belt, it was very loose. I saw Hilts and Ernie Koelsin there and they looked very good. I dreamed something of colored people, but I can't recall what it was now. I recall a doctor being present where I was. I was trying to cut a hole in a leather square."
"0610"	"(02/24/58)"	"I was at a union meeting and the chairman needed a fire committeeman, so he said, ""I nominate John Evans."" I declined because I was on the swing shift."
"0611"	"(02/25/58)"	"I was at the track and was a horse owner. A couple of buddies ran my horse and he was red when he came to the finish line. There was a small fire. I yelled at the guys and I went over to see the steward to find out if he was my horse. While my friend and I were looking at my horses, I picked out a cold red flat piece of sheet metal and that was one of my horses. My friend said he should be 100 to 1 and win. I slid him out on a conveyor and he slid down to the starting gate. A fellow with a ten-gallon hat was in front of us. The wind took his hat and blew it up into the air. We watched it go up, then it came down."
"0612"	"(02/27/58)"	"There was a grudge or a misunderstanding between us and a gang of bums. Our leader said, ""Wait, I'm going down here a while and then when I get back, I will give the order to fight."" But instead of coming back, he started to run away. And when the boys saw that, they started the fight. I was going across the lake, but there was a woman there that wanted to stab me with a knife. She was near a big plank. I dove under water and swam under the plank and got by her. Then I looked at the other end of the lake and there was a lot of water between me and the bank. I went for the bank across and I made it. When I got on shore, I was nude and with my fellow workers from White's. Now I thought how I would get home and get some clothes. I saw a fellow get angry at another fellow who was promoted to boss over him, and he knew this fellow did a lot of damage to the company property, especially the pipe lines. But he was found out and he ran away from the company. I was at the track. I played Bearsee and I saw the race and Bearsee won. The next time he was going to run, I was going to play the favorite of the first race who was beat by Bearsee to win and Bearsee for 3rd, but as I was going to the track, I was planning to play him 2nd and was sure he would come in 2nd. I looked at the entries and I saw Bearsee first and a lot of other entries. A man broke or shot a hole through a door and pointed the gun at me."
"0613"	"(02/27/58)"	"I picked and heard Ray Dsoher. I saw a list of entries for a special race. I won a lot of money from sister Ann. I went to the track and played a horse to win and place. I loaded him and another that was an entry I played to win. First the entry was scratched, then put on the board separate and I can't recall the names, but it was pp. 10 and was 202 to 1 odds. The race went off. I saw the horses go by below, then when they came by us, they were human beings running instead of the horses or they changed to humans. They had pp numbers on their backs. There were also some women."
"0614"	"(03/02/58)"	"I was going to work and Ann and Carter walked to the station with me, then Ann and Carter walked to the train stop and I waited to get a ride to work with a lady driver. I walked off with Carter and I thought I was late for my driver. I looked for my lunch, then left. I came into our back yard and someone piled apples in the corner of the fence, one on top of another up about 2 ft. high. I took them down. There was a dog or some other animal that some people had for a pet. I was afraid of it, but later I let it come up to me and I petted it and it was friendly. This family had a dumb son and two small children died suddenly, and then the mother and then the father almost got it, but found in time it was murder for the dumb son. I was playing cards and here seemed to be clubs hat I was getting. I was climbing up the side of a barn, then I crawled thru a small hole. I came back out and went down. There was a pig and some other animal that was ferocious and they climbed up the side of the barn, but there was a post or ladder against the barn. When the pig went away, I took off the lower part of the ladder just so I could reach it. I saw two of my friends running and the pigs were chasing them. I ran to the barn and climbed up the side of the ladder. I reached the top, moved a little coal on the side of the hole, and I was going to crawl thru. I looked down and the thing with the pig was trying to climb up the side of the barn, but couldn't. I was under a low bridge in the water with Robert Pokish. He swam out thru the water and I waited. There was a train coming over, so I waited."
"0615"	"(03/03/58)"	"I was driving on the highway and cars were coming by very fast, high rate of speed. I thought of my car, a pile of junk might fall apart while I'm driving at a high rate of speed. I stopped and Fisher went into a store. When he came back as we started, we had to wait for a chance to get into the traffic. I saw a man walking across the street towards us. He looked like Joe Lasko (deceased), my brother-in-law. But when he got near, he was a close double of Joe. We stopped on the turn of the highway. I looked at the highway and it was all cracked up, broken pavement. I said, ""That's the Ohio roads for you."" This was a badly damaged road. We were looking for something and we came to an old frame building. The windows were boarded up and someone said, ""What you are looking for is in the old building."" We looked thru the barn door like into the building and it was like a barn. It was filthy with flies, bugs and germs. We walked in and Fisher was doing something on the bench. I was standing beside him. I picked up a wristwatch and gave it to him. I said, ""You must have dropped it."" He took it. I picked up another watch and it was mine, so I put it into my shirt pocket. Ann and I lived in a house where there was a door between Becky's apt. and ours. I found a cake a day old, so I put it in the oven and I left the door open to Becky's apt. She could walk into our rooms. I met mother and told her what I did, so I went home and the cake was meat floating in boiling water. I fished it out. Then I thought someone could have got into our rooms and hid somewhere. I planned when I got home I would get my gun and search the rooms and attic. I saw two boys fighting when it stopped one was nundy. I put my hand on the seat of his pants and he had a hole in his pants, so I touched his bare bottom. I met Ann and we looked at a garden where there were new stocks of green corn growing. I heard, ""Put 2 on Nothing."""
"0616"	"(03/04/58)"	"Bob and his friends were throwing a football. I got hold of it and the cover was hanging on and it came off. The ball was nice and white. I asked Bob if I could give it one kick. I gave it one kick and it went so high. I don't remember even a batted baseball going so high. When it came down, it bounded about half as high as before. There was some kind of big insect making an air attack on us, but we finally got him. Alice, John and their mother had a funeral reception on their father who died. They even had an imitation hangman go thru the process of hanging the man, but something went wrong and some hot coals started to roll down towards the hangman and there was a catastrophe because a fire started and people went wild. We were held at bay by surrounding gunmen, but we finally got one of the gang to let us go. We were standing in a shadow and watched the soldiers go by us until one last one was going by. He saw us and we were put under arrest. We asked for permission to go hunting and we were granted it. There was a 7 lb. box of screws on the floor."
"0617"	"(03/05/58)"	"Fisher and I were on ice. I was not to touch a certain part of it that was sort of a goal or something, so I sort of jumped and then glided about 8 inches above the ice around the ice court. Then Fisher started to play tag. He tagged me and then I would tag him, and he would get after me. We were away from home. I was driving my car around. I tied the dog to a plant. He got hold of the plant and pulled it out. I wanted to know if Barley Nothing would win was picked. Barley Nothing, no. Paytown won."
"0618"	"(03/06/58)"	"There was something about glasses piled up or so many that was not correct. There were two girls living together. A friend of mine was mopping, washing the floor. The girls were happy that he was doing it. He was so slow that I got hold of a mop and I helped him. I went to see Bernie and he took me to his friend. I saw a name and # after it as winner. I saw Through."
"0619"	"(03/06/58)"	"I heard a bit of Irish Cheer."
"0620"	"(03/07/58)"	"Audrey and I were running thru a field. We couldn't stop so easy because it was muddy. When we stopped, a big road grate came toward us, so we started to run again. Then it seemed to turn into a horse. The boss of the crew pointed his gun to the road across the field, but didn't shoot. I had a fancy pistol and I had a picture of the crew boss with one of these guns. He was a picture friend and made a good profit doing it. I showed it to some policemen and they admired it as they held it with the newspaper clipping. The crew boss came in and I showed him the gun. He admired it and one of the policemen said he is a gun collector. It's a waste of money, how many guns he has."
"0621"	"(03/14/60)"	"I was flying in Gordon Park over the beach. I had a hanky on my face so no one could recognize me. It was covered. When I stopped there, I looked at the sky and it was dark from black clouds like a storm coming. I met a small girl and she said her boyfriend was much older and bigger than she, but she let him intercourse her. She wanted me to give her advice if she should let her dad know about this. We walked thru Gordon Park, then came to a creek that had 2 planks tied together as a bridge. The girl stepped over the creek, so I stepped over across the creek. Then the girl went thru a window. I was going to go thru and a woman closed the window. As I walked by the side of the house, step across came to me. I was watching a tractor go in front of us. All at once it was converted into a big truck. I mean big about a forty-ton loader. Then I was driving up a hill and the big truck was pushing me up the hill. Then it turned out to be freight cars we were on. The engine ahead of us was also attached to our cars. He then uncoupled and then went up a side track. We moved up on a different side track and then he came down by us fast and close. I watched the track and it was so close to our track. I don't know how he got by without bumping us. We were living in the house on East 68th St. I thought again here, here we are again the same old home. I went out on the porch of the attic and I got hold of the banister railing and it was loose. I pulled it down on the porch because I didn't want it to fall down the floors on somebody. Then I laid on the floor afraid to move. The porch was old and weak and would break with me. I came into the attic and it was a big room. I saw a girl in the other end of the room. I was flying down to her and I was surprised when I got down to the other end there were other women there and it was a store. There were all kinds of pans and kettles hanging on the walls and ceiling of the attic. I looked in surprise at the stock."
"0622"	"(03/14/60)"	"It was dark and I had the shotgun looking for a skunk, but I didn't get a chance to shoot at it."
"0623"	"(03/17/60)"	"I was in a barn. I peeped around a corner and there was a big bull. He was as big as an elephant. He saw me peep and he came around the corner, but was tied and I moved away fast. Bob was skating. He had an old pair for me, but they wore in the center on both edges. I walked on a slippery road, then Bob and his friend came back and I walked with them. We came to a place where we had to shoot the police. One was coming at me, his gun pointing at me. I was nervous when he was going to shoot me. Finally, one of my friends shot him. He fell to the ground. Then we came to the chief and he said we would have a big crowd if the weather was not bad. Then I noticed the dead cops were getting up. They were not shot. It was a masquerade. I was walking with a fellow who was tall or big. He was about 18 inches taller than me and a girl was also taller than me."
"0624"	"(03/18/60)"	"Ann was fixing light switches. I tried them and I flipped them back and forth and the lights would go on just dim. It was dark in the house. I took one switch apart and the wires were not on tight. They were loose. I tried the switch a few times and one of the wires started to burn. When I put it together, the lights went on. I was walking on a ridge and the height was high where I had to go around the edge of the rocks. Then I jumped off the road. I drove my car and the lights were on bright, then dim from Ann fixing the switch. It was night and dark."
"0625"	"(03/19/60)"	"I had a dream of the president of the USA."
"0626"	"(03/20/60)"	"I saw numbers 7th race, 1-3-4 and 8th race 4-1-2. Pete said I won $500. Leo came over by me with the paper. I wanted to look at the entries, but it was dark and I couldn't see the names clear enough, but then I saw 4-3-1 and I saw 4-4 for first or winner and I told Leo that number four was the winner. Eddie Palander came over to me and showed me a bull horse that he was to play. I said I was going to play it also because I was looking for a bull horse. I was trying to dream of the winner of one of six horses that are running the same day and the number four horse is showing himself."
"0627"	"(03/23/60)"	"I had a dream I was tall. Big, about six and a half feet high and I had on White's clothes. I was standing and could notice the height. I was talking to Mike Polca's dad and I asked him about the number four big horse and he said he will win. I was eating peanuts and they were big peanuts in the bag, about three-fourths of an inch long and about _ inch thick. I got the results and two other horses won besides the number four horse. I was thinking why I didn't hook them up in a reverse bet. The White's clothes were like underwear or dancing clothes and Audrey was with me dressed the same."
"0628"	"(03/22/60)"	"I had a paint brush and painted Kogler's legs with iodine. He said it burned, so he went into a small pool in the yard and was swimming around it. I was watching a manager of the Cts. He was planning on how to save some time for the company. He bent some sheet metal by his desk and made the platform shorter. This he planned was saving the company a fraction of a minute an hour. He looked at his watch and asked me what time I had. I said 15 minutes to the hour and he had 12 minutes to the hour. I met Charlie Charvat. We got some paint and were going to paint a concession stand. I saw water squirt up out of a down drain of a building. It did that for a few times. There was a house on the ground that was blocked. I picked it up and it was moving me around from the pressure. I hit the nozzle on the ground to free the object that was blocking the hose. The nozzle came off, but the hose was still blocked. I laid it out on the ground and ran away because I knew that it would break from the pressure. It started to spring leaks and we ran away. Tony Marlot was selling bread. He was talking with Carter. Carter hit her on the wrist. I said, ""Cut that out. Someone will blame me for that."" Then Ann laid down on her belly and Carter put his hand under her and felt her breasts. I had enough. I came up to Carter and said, ""This is the last straw. I am through with you. So long."" I said, ""Ann, you come along or I will be through with you also."" I was walking with Frank Kogler."
"0629"	"(03/24/60)"	"I was buying a loaf of bread. It was a long French loaf. I was pricing a new motor for my car and it was $300 for a motor and grill. I was selling some copper. One of the pulleys were too short on the motor and I gave it to the man selling the motor. He looked at it and the old one and nodded his head of approval. I was walking along with Rose Lasko. I held onto her hand and I was floating along with her three inches above the ground. We stopped in a restaurant. She went into the other room and I sat with another girl. I looked up at the sky and it was midday and it was dark. I saw some stars. I told the girl, ""This is the darkest day I can remember."" I drove down a side road and the ruts were so deep that cars were sliding on the ground, about three feet up on the ground and the ruts were down. It was solid earth about three feet high and as wide as from right wheel to left wheel. The wheels spinning against the earth moved the car ahead. I came to cars coming the opposite way and the fellow got out of his car and said, ""You better go back on the main road or you will be stuck in the jam up ahead."" So I backed up to the main road. I looked on the bed and I saw tiny bugs moving around. I scooped one up and he was like a beetle fair-sized. I tried to squeeze him with my fingernail and finally did."
"0630"	"(03/25/60)"	"I was looking for a man in an apt. house or a hotel. I had a fountain pen he had lost. I was playing horses 12 and 1 and one that was a long shot and two on a favorite. Mary said they were going to sell their home to Sue and Grandma was going to stay with someone."
"0631"	"(03/27/60)"	"I was near the track and John Bicon came from the track. He had a wrapped up bundle in the paper. He gave it to me. I took the entries off the bundle and gave the bundle back to John. I looked at the entries and picked number eight for the seventh race. It was a black horse."
"0632"	"(03/29/60)"	"There was a light on the sky. I was watching it. It was like a movie. It advertised Halle Brothers because Halle was on the light. Then it was like a map. It showed an island in the ocean right next to our continent, and it was blue. Then I was looking at an island from before. It was all rocky, no vegetation. There were a few trees or shrubs on it. There was a row of trees on the edge of the island. A real estate lady took us shopping for a home. She was taking us on the island for a lot. Ann kind of liked it, but I didn't care to buy on the rocky island. There was also a row of homes on the island's edge where the trees were. It was in the country."
"0633"	"(03/30/60)"	"I was working in the shop. I saw Margie S. I looked at her and her eyes were on me. I went to look at a house that was being built. I saw whiskey bottles lying around partly full. I came to a pond. It was clear water. I walked thru it, then I saw something jump on the bank. I looked there and saw two eyes of a big frog. Ed Stebner was sweeping a green caterpillar at me. It landed on my shoe. I shook it off and took the broom and swept it back at him. I got a bite on the shoulder from a big mosquito. I saw Bill Berringer drilling holes in fresh grapes. I had a new Pontiac. I was backing it up and it didn't want to stop like the other dreams of backing my car. I came close to a parked car, just touched it. I was on the square. It was so bad driving, the bus drivers couldn't see thru the windshields, and they were running over the curbs and the lawns. I saw one bus down on its side tipping over."
"0634"	"(03/31/60)"	"I was looking over the second race at Ascot, but the horses were like round circles with a hole in the middle. I noticed the seven or eight horse had a heavy ring. He stood out. I was counting the horses in the second race. I saw wizard."
"0635"	"(04/01/60)"	"I sat on the steps and Aunt Mary Pollander was doing the dishes. The lids and pans she put on the steps rolled down the steps and outside of the house."
"0636"	"(04/02/60)"	"I was coaxed into a duel to fight someone I didn't even meet for Bob or some of his friends. I walked over to Peter Drendas's place and was to meet the big bully I was to have it out with. As I walked bravely, I was thinking this was a challenge. When I got there, I met a fellow. He said, ""Follow me,"" so I walked into the country and woods. I thought I was walking into an ambush. We stopped in a spot near a stream eventually and I was on my guard. He said, ""I would punch your partner and then hit you one and it would be over."" I said, ""Don't fool yourself. When you would be hitting my partner, I would be on guard as I always am."" This surprised him, so he said, ""Let me show you how you would go about it,"" so I shadow boxed in front of him and he was convinced that I was pretty good. So he backed out of the fight. I heard Georgie."
"0637"	"(04/02/60)"	"I was on the lake shore. I saw a small white cloud about 10 feet off the ground hanging over us, then another one, bigger, come over and came down to the earth and disappeared. I looked way over the lake and the clouds were coming over the lake. They seemed to be way down on the lake. Ann and I were down in a valley. I looked up and saw Barbara and another girl on top of the hill. I had a small bonfire. It was dark. My brother Steve walked away from me and then was coming towards me and I was pointing a stick at him as he came at me."
"0638"	"(04/03/60)"	"I put film in a camera and when I turned to #1, I passed the center and the next two numbers were one. They were three ones. I saw Joe O'Korn giving Ann a drink of whiskey for our wedding celebration. When I came up, he gave me one. Saralee and Edward came to me. I saw big fellows dressed in new suits. My ability was repeating itself to me or coming to me."
"0639"	"(04/04/60)"	"I helped to put up some kind of shelter. John Wiatrak came over to watch us. He was talking to us. His voice was different than it usually is."
"0640"	"(04/05/60)"	"I saw and heard Weight. I am in Japan and riding on some kind of saucer. We had no wheels, but I piloted it by leaning to one side and scooted along the ground at a high rate of speed, about 80 miles per hour. I was with another Japanese who was in one and we sort of raced. I beat him. Then I saw another saucer. We dragged it off the street onto the sidewalk and opened the top cover and there were people inside. The Japanese ridiculed our religion that we swore and prayed at the same time. I said, ""We say, 'I am sorry God that I swore' and we are forgiven,"" which made sense to the Japanese woman who was ridiculing us. I had a handful of pennies and other coins. I was counting them. When I saw an Indianhead penny, I picked it up and it was not an Indian head penny, but a foreign coin. In my sleep I seemed to hear in the clouds and cloud eight."
"0641"	"(04/06/60)"	"I was with a Jewish lady and she took a liking to me. Cap Wilson also came to me as I lay in bed before I fell asleep."
"0642"	"(04/07/60)"	"One fellow had a half on one side mustache. There was a lineup for a man. He was a bandit that was looking for a jewel that was supposed to be hidden in the mustache. I had on my hunting clothes. We were lined up in front of the man. This man with the half or one side mustache had the jewel hidden in his half mustache and he had an idea that he was going to fool them with the half mustache and the man would let him go. We were buying carpeting for a big room. It was like a hall or auditorium. I walked thru it and inspected it. It sure would take a lot of carpeting. Ann was going to divorce me. She was going to marry Mr. Shun who was about 70 years old. In fact, she had already married him before she got the divorce from me. I was a sad man. I loved Ann and the children would be bounced around and have no mother. Mr. Shun was counting his money. He had a fifty dollar bill in the bundle."
"0643"	"(04/08/60)"	"I picked out a bushel of apples and went by Minnie's fruit store and he had big bananas, too big so I walked out with my bushel of apples and bought no bananas. I saw or heard pineapple. I had a shotgun pointing at a bad character. He had me poke him and hit him with the gun because I didn't want to kill him. Then I commanded him to obey my command. I was going to write 48 and I wrote 4 and 4 unconsciously."
"0644"	"(04/09/60)"	"Ann and I were exercising in the house. I looked into the mirror and my arms were big. Someone and I were letting my sister Ann down the steps. I heard 6 7 8 for Ascot that were picked by Lewis in the Plaindealer. I looked into a box that I was going to pick the winners at Ascot and I just got a glimpse of 7. Someone was or thing was glittering or shining into my eyes. Mother asked Judy, ""Am I going to live?"" and Judy said, ""No, you are not."""
"0645"	"(04/10/60)"	"I looked at my feet and my ankle at one foot seemed to be fallen in."
"0646"	"(04/11/60)"	"I was painting our home and the neighbor's. I was working up and down a winding stairway. I could find the door to go outside for a while. I was hanging on the wall because I couldn't get a footing to climb down. I called for a ladder and was given one. I was up on a wall."
"0647"	"(04/12/60)"	"We cut a hole though some wood top that we thought was covering a secret in India. Indians were lined up with their bows and arrows. They let go with the arrows and then ran in flight and the arrows missed us and we kept on running. We climbed up and over buildings till at last we were safe in some friends' home. We had a dog. He started to urinate at night. I took down on the pail and held my hand over cause it was splashing out. She urinated till the pail was full."
"0648"	"(04/14/60)"	"I was working with Mike Brown. We were drawing coke. I was operating frank's line with Teddy as my helper. I was looking at the entries and above the entries there was Sioux."
"0649"	"(04/15/60)"	"I was flying over a field. I tried to go thru a window. Ann and I were visiting by Barsa. Mr. Barsa was very talkative. She was kidding Ann. We had drinks at the house. I drove thru a place that was partly blocked and a policeman was shaking his head at me for going thru. I yelled at him. I was behind the truck and couldn't see the blockade till I was almost going thru it, then it was too late to turn back. Mrs. Barsa knocked on the bedroom door and Ann went in to talk to Mr. Barsa."
"0650"	"(04/16/60)"	"I seem to be running away from someone in flight or just running. I was cleaning out something and on the bottom as I scraped it, it still was sweet. Fisher and I were walking along a road. I looked over a deep valley and on the opposite a man was sitting with a pistol in his hand. Then we walked over a bridge. I looked down and it was very high. I was afraid to go near the other end. I was afraid to fall over. When we reached the other end of the bridge the water was high, almost reaching the bridge. I looked down Pearl Rd. and Ridge where there were a lot of trees before and now I noticed they were cut down and gone."
"0651"	"(04/17/60)"	"I was lying in bed half asleep trying to get the p.p. winner in the first race at Ascot tomorrow. I was counting sheets of paper in my hand. I had six sheets. I was down at White's in the woodwork. A storm was coming up. I went out looked up and the sky was yellowish. I said, ""A tornado is coming."" I went inside under a side of the building and I heard the tornado roar. I got under a steel freight car for protection. All at once the car was raised up and the car started to whirl around us in a circle about 2 ft. off the ground. I was sitting on it. It sort of flew off on a side and the car crashed into the side of the building and stopped. The storm was over. I started to walk up the stairway. I asked for the fourth floor and the man said the 3rd floor and on top. I got a hold of some pipes and everything was loose and I almost fell back, but finally got up. I heard there were some children killed swimming in the storm. It was a dark night. I was looking at some pictures and all at once they were movies. I saw Jimmy Clear come into the picture. He sat down and then moved away. Bob and I walked after him. We came to him and he seemed to be in a rocket. I said a few words to him and his rocket moved out of my way as though he were afraid of me. There was a big passenger boat out all lit up and anchored away from shore. A small boat went out and brought in the big boat with speed and ease to shore and harbor."
"0652"	"(04/18/60)"	"I saw eyes in my sleep. I saw a short name $45 winner. I can't recall the name."
"0653"	"(04/20/60)"	"I was working Dill's. I received a letter from White's to come back to work. I went to see Benny Meader. I had some paper in one hand and a pencil in the other hand. I told Benny that I would have to reject his offer. He was surprised because he was almost sure that I was going to take it. Andy Palader and he was courteous to them. The young lady was going to college. I was concerned about the job at White's."
"0654"	"(04/21/60)"	"We were planning on Audrey's schooling. I thought she should go to Lourdes Academy. One of the young good-looking sisters talked to me and she gave me a kiss on the lips. Later one as she came by she perked up her lips and I gave her another kiss."
"0655"	"(04/21/60)"	"I was working and I punched my time card to go home and I found out it was one hour too early. I was driving my car on Pearl and Ridge and stopped my car for the traffic light. Ann and Audrey got out and put Judy down on the street. She walked in front of the parked cars. I was riding on a small walker. I pushed myself with Judy on it. I was driving my car and the steering wheel was small, about six inches in diameter."
"0656"	"(04/26/60)"	"I was looking at a bulletin at church and reading the total amount that should be for raffle tickets. George Gideon and another white fellow met me. George did some stunt and went down on his head."
"0657"	"(04/27/60)"	"John Knetass said to John Gotch my number is 8-7-8. I was working  for some company. My right hand was sore and there was a sore streak of hardness across it. I thought it was blood poisoning. I threw a loaf of bread to mother. She caught it, then she thought she threw it back. It went up and hit her on the head. Then she threw it hard at me, but I caught it. All at once it got dark."
"0658"	"(04/27/60)"	"I drove to an intersection from a side street. I pulled out too far. A police car was coming thru the green light. He made a left turn across the street and stopped. I backed up so he would not give me a ticket for same. The windshield was steamed up good because I could just about see the light as it turned green. I started to pull out when I saw a car coming at me and stopped. I stopped and looked and I was on the left side of the street, so I backed up and got out of the way of the car. It was dark."
"0659"	"(04/28/60)"	"I looked at a name someone had. It was Boot. I told the party my name was almost he same. I was going to write my name and then I looked at the name and it was now boo. Then bo. I saw a big tire, one of those like a road scooper. It was standing as an advertisement. Then all at once it started to roll away. It rolled in a big circle across the road, then around and across again and it came towards me on one roll. I ran to get away from it, then I flew up to get away from it. On a couple of rounds it almost ran over cars on the road as they went by."
"0660"	"(04/28/60)"	"I was flying on two occasions. On one I had two children and was flying with them. A doctor was listening to my heart beat as I flew."
"0661"	"(05/01/60)"	"I was walking with my mother by Marty and I asked him if Probe is hope ran and he said he won. I was climbing up a rope."
"0662"	"(05/02/60)"	"I was walking along a new highway with some people and there were a lot of girls making fools of men. They sucked them in and then got a lot of money from them. I was in Rivertown my boyhood town. It was being built up. I said, ""I remember where I used to pasture cows, there were homes built now."" Ann said she was going to die and leave me. I was looking at Rivertown and I said what a beautiful town. It was full of trees just like a forest. I was working at White's. Joe Grabar let me look at one tool Bill Kotnik ground. I looked at it and commented how he ground it because it looked like no grind I saw before. I saw a town horse winner."
"0663"	"(05/03/60)"	"There was a captive. He was tall, so there was a bayonet point put against his heart and was pushed in slowly. The man made a painful expression. I thought the point was going to hit his heart, but it was pulled out and a lot of stab wounds were made in the shoulder and at last the victim held up his hand and surrendered. The stabbing was stopped and he talked. I was walking in White's. I went in the office and talked with the secretary and the executives. We went out for lunch and it was night out. We came out to a traffic light and it was red, but there were small cars, about four of them, went through the red light. They had a lot of lights on. Mother and I were in bed. I got up and I said, ""What is this?"" My neckties were on the bed. I complained and the door slammed by itself. It frightened Ann. I was intoning to make the evil spirit go away. We were standing on a bridge and watching the dirty water floating by. There were boys wading and poking sticks into the water. I was told they were looking for a seven-year-old boy who fell and drowned himself. I saw Charley Porhaska on the bridge. I was driving my small car thru a different town. I found a restaurant and then I found a treasure in it. Someone said Fisher won and will win again."
"0664"	"(05/04/60)"	"Bob and I were on a farm in the country. It was muddy. We put on boots except I. We argued with a boy. I told him it was 8 miles to Charvat's farm from our house, which we thought it was. I was watching a farmer enjoy a little coke. He played and drank it a little at a time. I saw chick or chic as the first selection in the first race at Ascot. I saw dru away."
"0665"	"(05/06/60)"	"We were standing beside a big tree and there was artificial wind made to blow on the tree. We told the people that a regular windstorm blew much harder than the artificial."
"0666"	"(05/07/60)"	"I was watching three people being covered by sand by being too greedy that one was going to survive the other. All went to eternity. A big bear was after us. He was so big we were afraid the shotgun wouldn't get him, so he was covered by a sand fall and went to eternity. I was waiting by a r.r. crossing to be picked up by a train that went by twice, but didn't stop for me. The train went by away from us."
"0667"	"(05/09/60)"	"I had trouble with colored people. They were giving me trouble. We drove to a place where there were a couple of men shooting their pistols. I went into our garden and we had long tomato vines crawling up a post. I took one big tomato and laid it in the sun to get completely ripe. There was a big storm."
"0668"	"(05/10/60)"	"I saw the number 1231 on some object that was moving by. I was in the country. I saw and heard two big frogs croaking their heads out of the water. I went further and I saw a doe lying on top of a dead buck. I felt sorry for the doe. Someone shot the buck out of season and it got away but it died. I was by a r.r. track watching the traffic moving. I was going to jump a freight as it started to move, but I saw a man near which made me think he was a r.r. detective."
"0669"	"(05/11/60)"	"I saw gloss color picked to win. I saw leader as winner. I saw a newspaper and the headline started Admit one Cent and I awoke. Ann and I were driving down a road. We came to a road. It was so steep. I put my brake on and I held onto the sides and let the car down slow. When we came down, I looked up and a girl was coming down in her car slowly. It was about 95 degrees steep. I saw Uncle Jake with his high power rifle in Shinnae hunting ground hogs. When he walked by, I saw a fox stick his head out of a hole and then come out. Rubber was flooded over the land and we were shoveling, digging it and hauling it back with wheelbarrows."
"0670"	"(05/12/60)"	"We were painting the rooms and wanted tos ee where to start, so there would not be a mark. One room we couldn't find a mark, so we were going to paint that room for the finished coat. I was lying in bed thinking who would win the d.d. at Ascot. 1 for the 2nd race and 3 for the 1st race. 31dd. I went over by Frank Zypanick. His blonde wife seemed to be stout. I was going to wash walls and windows. Then Mike Catcher came over and two other fat men. They were bragging who was the stoutest. There were some stout or fat horses won and I played them. I was working next to Otto who was running an acme and the spindle was high overhead. I told him if a short fellow was operating it he would have to use a stepladder to get a bar in. There was one acme that had 7 or 8 spindles. I was going to ride on a streetcar, which all the employees did. It was waiting for me."
"0671"	"(05/13/60)"	"I was working in the shop."
"0672"	"(05/14/60)"	"I was at the track and I heard some people saying, ""Let them build the odds on Ok Boy. He will pay a bundle. He will win."" Clay worker was coming to me. I had a horse picked, but I can't remember the name."
"0673"	"(05/15/60)"	"Ann was being escorted by gentlemen and then one was going to stay with her and win her. I also stayed with her and he was talkative. She got fed up with his gab and sight. She grabbed the clock and threw it at him. Then she picked up another object and threw it at him. This convinced him that he was not wanted around and he left. We were for a ride in the country. My brother Steve was driving my car and my brother Joe (deceased) was with us. I looked out in the field and I saw a male jackass intimating a female. When he got off, I saw his big penis hanging limp."
"0674"	"(05/16/60)"	"I lit a match and was burning small bedbugs on my clothes as they moved about."
"0675"	"(05/17/60)"	"I was reading apache bellyache will be traveling. That is all I read when I awoke. Carl Fisher and I were surrounded by a gang of gangsters of Mexican bandits and we were getting captured and marched into a big hall. Guns were taken and there was only one way I saw to escape. I started to fly and one of the bandits gave me a shove, which gave me a good start. I flew to close windows and then I flew back to the doors and I escaped. Fisher in the surprise of me also escaped. We were crossing a field where there were cows and one cow started to charge us. We started to run for the fence in flight. Fisher said, ""Shoot your gun."" I said, ""I have no gun,"" but I put my hand into my pocket and felt a small gun. We got under the wire, then walked over where the bandits were in the big hall. They were inside, afraid of us. We had our two guns. People were going in and out of the hall and they gave us respect."
"0676"	"(05/18/60)"	"We parked the car in Hinkley and stopped to see Charlie Charvat. He was standing in his shorts with his baby in his arms on the porch. He didn't know we were there. A fellow came up to me with something on his mind. He said something about my car and kept on hinting. I said, ""I parked my car properly."" Then I asked him what did he mean and he just hinted and would not say what. I got mad and was threatening him, but he wouldn't talk. We walked to where the car was and there was a gang of fellows standing around. One of the fellows came up to the car and hit it and put a couple of dents in the body. I pushed him away and told him again, ""I'm going to sue this fellow. You know who he is and you are going to be my witnesses."" They didn't answer me, but turned away from me. This fellow came at the car with a pitchfork. Me and my partner kept him away and finally got the fork away from him. Then we found out they were peeved at me and the car because I laid a big cardboard box on top of a tub of water. When I took it off, they were relieved and I apologized. I said, ""I laid it there without thinking that there was a tub of water under it."" We drove along where the streetcar tracks were from Fairchance to Rivertown. I had to straighten the wheel for peanuts. He was driving. The fork was broken in the fellow's hands when he came at the car by me and my friend. I looked up the date of my insurance and I saw June 1."
"0677"	"(05/21/60)"	"It was Audrey or Barbara that was small, about 8 years old, and had a death grip on Bob's throat. I yelled to let go, but she didn't heed it and I heard Bob moan and gasp for air. So I grabbed her hands and wanted to loosen her grip, but she held on. Then I was really going to work on her when I awoke. I was driving around, then I seemed to be in some kind of trouble. I wanted to escape with an engine and as I backed up, a car uncoupled and went down over a hill. I mingled with the police and people. I saw a girl lying on her back nude and I could see her vagina. The car got away from the engine. I heard 1st. I saw someone put up 4 fingers."
"0678"	"(05/23/60)"	"I was in Chester's car and the to or roof of his car was high like a bus. I was in the house in Rivertown and it was night. The door seemed to be open and I thought it was closed before. I told Andy P., ""Let's go into the room and see if anyone came in."" I looked in from behind the doorway and saw no one, so I walked in and Andy behind me. We looked behind the furniture and saw no one. I came to the window in the shop and looked out to see if a fellow's car parked outside. I came to work and Eddie K. came in also on the same shift. I was working at White's again. As I lay thinking who was going to win the 7th race, I saw a 6 on a horse. I came home by Grandma's and she gave me some food to eat. Someone was given a present. I heard singing a couple of times or it was music."
"0679"	"(05/25/60)"	"There was someone attacking our home. I was walking thru a field to come at them thru the rear. I saw a man walking towards me. I paid no attention to him, but then I saw another man from the opposite direction coming towards me and I had a feeling of being hunted and run down. I walked fast, but the two men were closing in on me. When they came close, I started to run. They kept on coming closer and closer and one man had a wire rope in his hand. They were right behind me and I was very nervous, expecting to be brought down by the wire rope around me. I met Margie S. I kissed her on the cheek and a little on the lips. She had a baby. We were playing some kind of game with play cards. A storm came up and started to blow away the game chips, so I put them away. We were down in the basement. I came to some kind of party. Two men tried to attack me for my wallet of money I had in my pocket. I kept them off, then climbed up above them."
"0680"	"(05/27/60)"	"I was looking at a brick building that was toppling over slowly on a frame home. I yelled to the occupant that he should get out or be crushed. We owned a stone building nad it seemed to be a little tipsy."
"0681"	"(05/30/60)"	"A little baby was riding on a horse. He made a quick stop and the baby almost fell off. Then the horse started to go and the baby slid back. A male horse came by and the 2 horses began to fight. The baby threw himself between the two horses' heads and it was pushed, bucked and I think chewed. I turned my face away from the thought. The two horses seemed to disappear. I figured they fell thru the window. I went to the window, looked down and there was one horse. His feet were caught in the closed window. He was on the porch roof and sort of mangled. I opened the window and gave him a kick and down he slid. I looked down on the street and there lay one horse dead and his head was off, missing, dissected. Part of his body was scattered on the ground. I was going to tell Andy P. of the fate of his horses. I met Peter Arendas and I gave him a dollar to give one of his friends who I owed it to. I drove and it was a stop and go most of the while. I drove along and came across a broken bridge. It was lying in the creek. I saw polar bear. I seemed to repeat five when I wanted to say which horse was going to win out of the horses. 5 was belly ache. The baby that lay still after the horses brought it up, got up and came to life."
"0682"	"(05/31/60)"	"I flew across the street, then I saw some fire started across the road. All I did was blow some air on my breath on or towards the fire and they went out. Later I heard Bill Kotnik for making the fire, but I found out Gus Menkie was the firebug. Julie Marlot told me I was needed in the St. Francis church for assistance. When I got there and asked her what I was to do, she said to sing in the choir. I said, ""I can't sing."" There were two bakers baking bakery at our house. The bakery looked delicious. I was playing a machine where you put in a quarter. I was getting bakery out of it and times my quarter came back out. There were two tramps who came to our house. I got the rifle and shot several times at their feet before they would make a move. One of them later turned out to be Bill, a fellow from White's who I see at the track once in a while. He resented my rifle, but I had to protect myself and family. I told him I didn't recognize him before, otherwise I would not have done that to him. I was out in the country picking up sticks and throwing them at the birds for food. I sold or bought a home and someone said, ""How is someone going to buy your home if they don't have enough cash?"" I said, ""The bank sends an appraiser and he sets the loan amount for the buyer and the buyer must have a certain amount and the bank gives him a mortgage."
"0683"	"(06/01/60)"	"We were walking along kissing and an old couple were walking along about 500 ft. to the side of us kissing also. Marty was giving me some cakes that were leftover. I was lacing my shoes and there was a piece of paper tied with the laces I was going to school. I met the boys from White's. We had a class meeting or sort of party and had a sort of neckpiece that went over our collar shirt. We had a new home. There was a padlock on a trap door on the floor of the toilet shed. I opened it and looked it over. There was a hole in the sheet metal around it and it had a hole that drained into the main toilet hole or a pit. Mike Polka dressed in girls' clothes and he looked like a beautiful girl. The trap door was a cover on the floor."
"0684"	"(06/02/60)"	"I was working on an acem with Charly Pryhaska. We were turning out big brass pieces. I put some stock away on the public square and went to look for it. I came to a plum tree and ate some plums. I was posing with a girl I didn't like. I had my cheek against hers and the fellow was taking the picture. I was doing some detective work for a woman who wanted to get her husband back home who left. We finally got him home with jealousy. He almost shot the detective. I took the gun away from him and aimed it to be sure to miss his face and fired it to the wall. The white woman turned out to be a colored woman. We were getting her husband back. The colored woman came while I was lying on the bed playing with Judy."
"0685"	"(06/03/60)"	"Shianne, our dog, was trained to walk over a car and adv. it by the way he walked and gave signs. Fisher and I were at church. He got out before me and as I was walking to catch up with him, I saw him away ahead. I met Margie S. I was glad to see her and she me. So we went back to find my car. We went by the back way. We climbed over fences and went up steps and finally we got over a fence and down a stairway and there was this spot we left the car. She looked over into another yard and there it was. We went over and, to my surprise, wrecked and demolished. A fellow came up to us and asked me if it was my car and I said it was. He said, ""Wait a minute, they are going to sue you."" I went into the rear of the car and I saw different state license plates on the car. I said, ""This car is not my car."" Marge turned out to be John Chepka and he said, ""It is your car because your mechanic is making markings with chalk on it. I remember those and now I saw the fraud these two were pulling. I said, ""Now how much will you give me for my car?"" One of them said, ""Give him $400,"" and I was going to ask them more for it. He was going to give us passes and give us 2 caps. I was on the street with the kids. Joe Arendas was in the street with kind of kids' carts. I copped a feel from a lady. I was going to the track. I picked up a paper and a form was in it. I looked at a program that was marked. I looked for the date and all I could see was 3, which did not seem to clear. I was in the country by Jake Polander, my uncle. I went to the toilet outside. When I entered, I was surprised the toilet seats were covered out of use. There was a toilet in the house now. There was a small hole where the toilet seats were on the board cover and it was close to the wall."
"0686"	"(06/06/60)"	"I seem, but not so clear, to have seen something fall down, a tree or something. It was not clear to me when I awoke. I was going to or getting ready to intimate a very close relative."
"0687"	"(06/07/60)"	"We were watching two crows flying around quite close, but it was in the city limits and we couldn't shoot them. We were in a cafe and two Negro boys were dancing. One had a dance where he rolled on the floor. Ann and I danced and when we came close to the end of a fancy dance, I fell down on my knees. I lost my balance. We brought two chairs for my brother Steve and me and one was a rocker. I was looking at some green vegetable. It was supposed to be a manufactured product that was done for Harwood Hilts."
"0688"	"(06/08/60)"	"As I about fell asleep, I thought of the daily double and it was 4-1-4. It seemed to have a halo around it. Ann's father had a gun pointing at me. He thought I was a stranger and was protecting himself. He was concealing some secret ailment from me and then I saw the cloth taken away from his body and his penis was gone. Cancer had eaten it away. I was flying in White's. Three men came up to rob us. One was a big man. They pulled out guns and I got out of the way of them. They had water pistols. I got one away from one of them and squirted water into the side. It burned his eyes because he couldn't see. Then I picked one up and threw him on his head, then the other one, and they were beginning to see I was strong and started to move away from me. I made magic. I commanded the towel to come into my hands from the clothesline and it did. Then I threw a towel on the floor and made it come to me when I commanded it. Then one towel started to spin and disintegrate by my feet. I made a sign of the cross and commanded it to go away and it stopped. My brother Steve went down a basement that seemed like a dungeon, a place of dead corpses. He seemed to be a strange being. He ate human flesh."
"0689"	"(06/09/60)"	"I was a cowboy and there were three bad men that I had to handle. I hid behind a tree and was making like I was shooting at them and they at me, like bang bang and pointing at them at the same time. I saw black as winner. I saw Eddie on a sign."
"0690"	"(06/10/60)"	"I picked out a horse. I found out he didn't win, so I picked another one and it was a blue car."
"0691"	"(06/11/60)"	"I was looking up. I saw something flying high up. Then I saw a dog come down. It landed on the ground and it floated up about six feet off the ground. I got hold of it and inside the glass I saw a bug. It was alive, crawling around. Then there was a horse's head with one eye. It had a frightened look. The other crossed. I then saw a bright spot on the left palm of my hand. The bug seemed to have gotten out of the glass and drove itself into my hand. I pressed it and puss came out and I could see one foot of the bug sticking out. I pressed it again and it wouldn't come out. One fellow said the horse was blind, but he would win."
"0692"	"(06/13/60)"	"I saw Vulcan 7 on back of a Vulcan and there is no such Vulcan as number 7. I was watching borders lying around on top of the roof of their apartment. They had rags sticking on top of the cracks on top of the roof. Ann moved one rag and they started to slide into the crack."
"0693"	"(06/14/60)"	"I dug out tree roots. We were cleaning up the yard of winter dirt and shrubbery. We had a new place and were doing the landscaping and some spring cleaning. I was dressed with an overcoat walking the street. Felt sort of a gentleman. We lived on 68th St. I looked at the kitchen door and a side panel of the door frame was broken off. It couldn't be locked. I saw Mrs. Kotnik bend over to wash the floor and her vagina was in open view. I had a hard-on and I pushed it against Ann."
"0694"	"(06/15/60)"	"I was intimating Ann. I saw three or five on an object. I can't recall what it was."
"0695"	"(06/16/60)"	"I heard or saw 1 and four. I was working. There was a lot of brass work. John Sorenso, the boss, was making a fireplace ornament out of a brass bar. He twisted it into a fancy shape."
"0696"	"(06/17/60)"	"I was carrying Judy thru the countryside thru high weeds. I was thinking what if I ran across a bear. What would I do? All at once I looked ahead and I saw two small bears. This frightened me because I knew the mother was near. I started back for home. It was night. When I got home, I thought of closing the door and when I went for the front door, I saw one of the cubs in front of the storm door. I closed the door and I looked thru the small window on the door and I saw the cub on his haunches looking at me. Then the mother bear came by the door and said, ""Let us in,"" and I said, ""Would it be alright if I gave you food outside?"" but the mother bear said, ""We will get in."" The bear was actually talking. I told Bob, ""Get your shotgun loaded."" I was in a building and when a fellow came to see us, I took him thru the rooms, which were being built. He looked them over as I explained different things. It was sort of inspecting. I got a letter from White's Sewing Machine to come to work to a good, easy job paying my regular wages. When I was to go down, I met someone and I was told I would be asked if I was 42 years old, the job was mine, and I had to admit that I was 42 or I was dropped. I thought what a racket. I went down to White's and when I got to the office there was a truck there. Joe Grabar, the boss, was helping to unload it. The fellow with the dirty hat looked like an undertaker. I came closer and I was eating a potato with a peeling on it. One fellow came up to me and I knew him from White's. He asked for a bite. I gave him a big bite of the potato and then another fellow came over and he also got a big bite of the potato. I was picking up money, dimes, quarters and half dollars from the floor between the people's feet who were dropping them accidentally."
"0697"	"(06/18/60)"	"I was intimating Ann and she put up mirrors so she could see the act. I watched my penis go into he and it was big. All at once the door opened and Audrey surprised us. I rolled off Ann and she laid there. Audrey sort of grinned at our surprise. I was working on some kind of a problem. It was a mystery or a mystical because it solved predictions. I seemed to be near the North Pole or north near it. I was in Arabia and Arabians were after the knowledge of the mystery. I was riding a cardboard box on the kitchen floor in certain back and forth ways and this seemed to make some sense to one of the Arabians because he told a servant to get me a glass of milk and he gave a certain gesture to her. He gave me the idea he wanted her to slip a mickey to me. I told him not to get the milk for me because I would not drink it. I was going to a bar and there was a bull coming out. The Arabian said, ""Never get in front of a bull."" I saw 14 on the calendar for the Ohio derby. I was going to see what the daily double was and I heard 6 6. I walked into house and a fellow was coming thru the rooms with some kind of a farmer gardening equipment. He roughed up the carpeting and scattered other things. I got angry and went outside for him. It was dark and I couldn't see him on the street. I clenched my fists and started looking for him. I went into a building to look for the men's room. I looked in one door and I saw a lady apparel, so I opened the other door and I saw some women inside. On both doors and walls there were marking in pencil, ""Artist at Work."" I picked up one block and it was 59 and another was 54. A fellow lit a candle and put it into his mouth. It raised up to his hairline and went out and then it was a cigarette and he had a habit of holding it up right near his right eye while smoking. I was painting a small rock arch about 12 by 12 and all at once water came between the rock. I thought a water pipe broke and water came from it. Then it stopped."
"0698"	"(06/19/60)"	"I was walking at night to the next street. I was on my way to see a prostitute. I met a small boy and another fellow. He was down on all ours like a dog. I was afraid he might try to rob me, so I was on the alert. He walked with me a ways and asked me if I had a few cents to buy a cup of coffee. I looked into my pocket and gave him 3 dimes. The little fellow also wanted some money, so I gave him 2 dimes. As I turned the corner of the next street, the fellow came into the street, honked his horn at me and made a stop. He had a passenger car. He got out and waited for me. He said, ""How do you like my 1924 Pontiac?"" I looked at it and now it was a big long truck. The body was new. I was hanging out a sign. I had a long board which I tried to put thru a window, then lean it on the roof. I was at the racetrack. I was looking for a good place to park in the parking lot so I could get away when I wanted to. Someone gave me a program and a lot of tickets they played and they were losers. I played the last race and played the wrong one and lost."
"0699"	"(06/20/60)"	"I started to fly across a valley. I seemed to be driving on a rocky road."
"0700"	"(06/22/60)"	"I saw 6-6 in the paper. I tried to dream what post position was going to win in the sixth race. I was lying on the ground and a long worm was trying to wrap itself around me. I got up and cut it in two and it was partly in the ground and partly out. I was bawling out my family for not watching Judy. She had a handful of her feces and put it into her mouth and ate it."
"0701"	"(06/23/60)"	"It was election day. I stopped at Pauline Lenarcic's rooms. Her sister was there and Pauline seemed to be angry at me. She threw a few remarks at me, but I stayed and took off my clothes to my underwear and lay on one of the beds. Her sister came over and played with me. I went down to the election meeting and I parked my car near some beds. My sister Mary was passing out drinks. Steve gave me a highball with water. The water seemed to steam a little as he poured the whiskey into the water. I was then hanging out some sort of election returns on a clothesline. We Democrats won. Bob and I were in the country in a field hunting. We came to a walnut tree and I found a sack and was putting nuts into the sack. The nuts were big. I put them into the sack. I heard the bird squawks in the country or their songs. I broke a table. I tried to pull the legs together, but it wouldn't give, so I sat or jumped or bounced on it with my rear and it finally crashed in. I was saying, ""Big crash, a big horse should win."" I saw 6-8. I was supposed to go to a wedding reception."
"0702"	"(06/25/60)"	"I was driving and sitting in a car. I saw a small taxi cab and two fellows went in one door of the car and came out the other door just to go through it."
"0703"	"(06/26/60)"	"I saw Walter Luzra in a hospital. He was talking how silly he was, worried all the money he spent foolishly. He tried to injure me on a couple of occasions, but I was on the alert. He was unsuccessful. I saw a murder committed and then the 2 assassins commit suicide with poison pills. I saw 9, then I put an X over it. I was climbing up after my small box to keep my eye on him so he would not fall or injure himself. I went into O'Korn's backyard to look for something and when I came out in our backyard we had about five piles of burning rubbish and newspapers. I put more on to get rid of all the rubbish. We were looking at race 6. I said, ""I think Honey Nob will win. He is p.p.7,"" and a farmer pointed at the last one, pp.8 and said, ""He will win."" There was a dent or print of the first horse and the name seemed to be Gold Count. I went into hot water in an elevator shaft to do something. I walked thru water which was hot and about a foot deep to one end of the shaft and reached up my hands to two fellow workers and I climbed up and out. I found two small pies on a shelf. I ate one. I took a long bar from the back end of a car and was going to use it to hold up an open window, but I changed my mind and was not going to do that. I saw a few kids with a tomcat and small kitten. I didn't see what the tomcat was doing to the kitten, but I heard it mew once in a while."
"0704"	"(06/27/60)"	"We were living in the north in a town. I talked to a real estate man and said if they were going to build in Ontario, which was quite north, and he said, ""This is as far north as they would go."" He also said we could get a big blizzard and it could kill off about three million people. This made us kind of leery. I met some of my boyhood schoolmates, Jamps Tipon. I walked thru Rivertown, my boyhood town. I looked into the homes and to my surprise, there were people living in all the homes just like old times. I was surprised and thought where are these people working because the mine was closed. The town was revived. I was up north again. Three fellows had gold. One fellow weighed it. It was in containers. Two of the containers weighed the same and one was a little lighter. Then he walked away. He didn't want to. Ok, this one is saying for a three-way split. The other fellow went over and weighed the light pack and gave it the ok stamp. I was going to leave the next day to go home and the big man asked me if he could ride with me. I said ok. I was driving my car and another car. I was driving by remote control. All at once the remote control car started to come towards the left to my car. I stopped my car and the remote control car crashed or collided into another car head on. I saw 7Ñ7 for a fraction of a second. I wanted to know what p.p. a horse would run the next race."
"0705"	"(06/28/60)"	"A tribe of Indians came upon us flying like shields. We got hold of the shields and mounted them and flew them also. When you were on, you seemed to be free from attack. A young girl tried to get my shield down. I tried to get away from her, but couldn't, so I picked her up and I flew with her. I put my hand on her vagina and she said I came. I let her off to a shanty with a young man and I left. The Indians got the flying shields back from us somehow and were guarding them. I got to them through my knowledge of the chief and when I got to the shields, a guard jumped out to stab me. I got hold of his hand and pushed the dagger away from me. I gave him the high sign and he relaxed. I was a friend. I then left and had to get a fellow to go with me to kill the guard. I heard it was Joe Hlavah. I came to a meeting place and asked for Joe and a fellow pointed to a table to the right. I looked there and there he was. I got him and we got the flying shields. I saw a parade of them coming our way. I yelled at our men to get off their horses. We would meet with the shields and Indians and make peace. I was doing a fancy dance for a dance I was to act in."
"0706"	"(06/29/60)"	"I awoke saying, ""I don't know."" We were trying to capture a spy. He had a gun and was using it and so was one of my friends. He was captured last. There was another spy and I helped to capture him. I waved my hand to the police when to move in. I was on top of the spy and took a blade which he intended to use on me because he had an idea that I would get him down. I sort of walked in on the air over gulleys. I walked right off a cliff and walked right on the air. A friend of mine also walked. He seemed to be Joe Arendas."
"0707"	"(06/30/60)"	"A man was looking for something on the floor o the theater. He was on his hands and knees looking between the girls' legs on the floor. Some pulled down their skirts and pulled their legs together, and some pulled up their skirts and spread their legs a little so he could look. My sister Ann and I went into a big restaurant. We went to each window in the back. There were about four or five. I pushed the curtains apart and looked thru each window to see if someone was out there whom I was looking for. I met Rose Lasko and John Andreas (deceased). I was waiting to see Judy and Ann was coming in. Mother and I were lying on the bed with Judy. I let my hard-on come out of my pants and I said, ""Look what I have."" Then it dawned on me we were not on terms of very intimate terms. I filled a whiskey bottle of my own from a different bottle and put it away on a shelf. I tried to put it so it would not show too much."
"0708"	"(07/01/60)"	"I saw the electric wire near the light socket smoke. I turned off the switch, but the light or power didn't go off and it smoked more and it started to burn. Fire came out of the socket. I was going to call the fire department. The bed was dirty. I was cleaning it off. I looked at a piece of pipe which was insulated. Frank Zup and I were looking at the results and a steel or metal horse won. I forgot the name."
"0709"	"(07/02/60)"	"I asked Steve if a pin was holding a loose screw that was held in the gauge. He said yes. We walked over a bed of dirt. He dug a hole into the bed of dirt and there was swirming and squirming young larvae that was to be pins. I picked up some with my fingers and one must have got down my back because I could feel it go down and it tickled me. I looked at the time and it was 1 o'clock a.m. I looked at a window and it had mud or something smeared on it. Also there was broken panes with holes in them. The boy pulled down the shade and John Scronzo raised and looked at it."
"0710"	"(07/03/60)"	"I was sneaking away with something to put in back. I had to crawl thru a small hole and put the thing in a shanty. A boy saw me and came over to the shanty and saw me, so I had to tell him I was doing this to surprise the boy. It was raining and the water came down the tracks. A boat came down. I sort of helped to push it and my pants got wet up to my knees. This turned out to be a log I was helping to push and then to steer. I had to lift it sometimes and then push the front end. We moved it into the house. I went down and walked Al Lasko into a room with myself. He was supposed to be a girl. In the morning he was to go upstairs and tell them we got married."
"0711"	"(07/04/60)"	"I looked at a name of a horse and I saw 6. I can't remember that name. I was driving, looking for a place to park with a friend. I was driving and a fellow in front of me went thru a red light two times and stopped when he went by. I bought a pair of shoes."
"0712"	"(07/05/60)"	"I saw final peuer in a magazine. I saw a stars and one was crossed off, so there were 5 stars on a piece of paper. I saw look. Judy was running after her mother. She started to walk. I called her and she walked over to me. A fellow told me another smart kid threw potatoes at me and missed me. I saw him going up the hill. I caught up to him and told him what could have happened. ""You can kill someone and then you would be sorry, but it would be too late."" Then I met him again and gave him a talking to again. I said, ""Now what if you killed someone and you were in court and a sister, brother or wife were crying for their loved one you had killed -- how would you feel?"""
"0713"	"(07/06/60)"	"I was working at White's in the flats. I saw Mox Harter (deceased) helping to loosen up some sharps. They were moving them out again. I then helped to take some apart. Andy Palander put some boxes on top of loaded freight cars. I looked at them and said, ""You have them stacked too high. They will fall off the cars when the freight starts rolling."" Then my brother Steve and I were lying on top of a freight car and it was running fast. We had a sheet and were hanging onto it. I was nervous because I was afraid we would fall off. Then we were off. A lady dressed in a G string and a bobby cover was standing off aways and she was showing us her body sex organs. She put her hand by the G string and pulled it apart so we could see a bit of her vagina. The women that were with us said, ""What a filthy woman."" Then she was coming towards our cottage and the women were in front of the door. She gave them a piece of ice about 12 by 6. They took the ice and didn't want the woman to come in. We took a bird out. He was blue. I let him go as a wild bird. The male bluebirds were after her and she was a little afraid. I climbed up to get her, but she moved to where I couldn't see her. Later I found out someone shot her. I bawled out some man for it. I was walking over big piles of socks that salesmen had piled on the ground. I followed Carter up a steep road and went to the top which went over and steep down on the other side. I didn't go over the top. We went to see some army maneuvers. We watched the soldiers shoot down decoy planes. I went into a clothes closet and I looked for my pants. I found a pair like mine, but when I put them next to mine, they matched, but were bright new colored, not faded like the ones I have. I looked thru a window where I thought someone was holding my brother Steve. I saw a man on the bed, but it wasn't Steve because he saw me and didn't wave at me. I looked inside and saw respeak, kind of blurred, but I made it out as respeak."
"0714"	"(07/07/60)"	"I was waiting for a bus. There were a lot of people there. I heard a woman yell, ""Hey, Margie, come here."" I went where I heard the woman yell because I thought I would get the bus sooner. There was a line. I got in it and was walking towards the bus."
"0715"	"(07/08/60)"	"I saw it seemed like harmony hope $45. This horse won the last time and paid $164. Carl Fisher was resetting the die. Someone came up and reset 2-vi-32 scres together and ran the diehead over this and it lined the chasers. I was driving or walking over the highway and it was hilly. Carl and I were working in a different dept. I was looking for a card or ticket to write my time on. There was water on the streets flooding and washing things down. I got a shovel and had some water released that was dammed up. There were things floating down the street from stores that had articles on display outside. I saw a pair of high boots in the water flooded in front of a store."
"0716"	"(07/09/60)"	"I saw bimballet as winner. We were in the country and one of the boys had a 22 pistol. Bob shot at a garage door. I said, ""Give me a that pistol don't shoot at doors."" Later a fellow was looking for empty cartridges. Someone gave Lattomer a double shotgun and we were hunting for pheasants. He gave me the gun. It was very heavy. I saw a pheasant on the ground. He started to come towards me and there buildings were around me. I waited for him to go by me and when he was ready to go around the building, I shot at him and it was a dud. I looked at a baby a lady was holding and it had blue eyes. A friend of mine was near me and I looked at him and his eyes were exactly blue as the baby's. I said, ""Look, your eyes are like the baby's."" He didn't like that because he walked away."
"0717"	"(11/07/61)"	"I saw Love as winner. I looked into a book or magazine and I saw Kirk, Kick, or Kiek. I am not sure it was a hot tip. We were cleaning the basement ceiling. I got a broom and was brushing off cobwebs and I ran into ticks. They came down on me and did they bite me. Later I looked at Carter's shirt on him and he had bumps all over his back and chest from tick bites. I got one bite just then, so I said, ""I'll fix this one. "" I lit a match and put it on the tick. It stopped biting and it started to come out a little, then seemed to die and it was like a sliver protruding out of a swelling on my hand. There was a beehive on a wall next door. They wanted to get rid of it. I said, ""Get hot water thru your hose and sprinkle it."" I covered myself with a screen. I took no chances on being stung by bees. I got some hot tips from a couple of men, but can't recall the names now. I was repeating 802. There was a man painting on a bridge and he always made an 0 with his brush when he finished painting. I was going to school. I was walking on Superior Ave. and I heard Millie's voice in singing. It was above all the others. She was going to school classes. Our bathtub was overflowing. It was blocked, running over the floor. The sink was also overflowing."
"0718"	"(11/08/61)"	"I had a whip. It had a lot of tails. Another man had one also. I said, ""I'm going to whip you."" He just laughed at me. I had a hard time untangling the knots, but I got it loose and I cracked the whip. Shy, our dog, was loose and I said, ""Who let you loose?"" and he said, ""Mother did."" I was in a shanty that had all kinds of old rugs and clothes all over, piles of it on the floor. I was buying something and the clerk was measuring the wood I was buying."
"0719"	"(11/09/61)"	"I was unraveling some string I was going to tie on a post. Some men gathered around me and were going to beat me up. They accused me of going around nude. I yelled for, ""Help Police,"" but no one came. I seemed to get away from them and was running and kind of going up flying like. Mr. Fisher (deceased) was coming behind me, then he turned into a young man and he was catching me by the foot. Bob and I were hunting. He shot twice and got two pheasants. I walked over and picked one of them up. As I was walking, I saw a rabbit standing. I thought he was dead and stiff. I was going to poke him with my gun. When I got close he ran. By the time I got my gun up, he was in the bushes and I found out my gun was broke. I had no shells in it."
"0720"	"(11/11/61)"	"Our Judy was playing outside and she disappeared or was lost or kidnapped. She was gone for about a week and all kind of thoughts came to my mind of what could have happened to her. I was sad and I missed her so much. I just seemed to be waiting for her return."
"0721"	"(11/12/61)"	"I seemed to see the name of one of Frank's horses. I was watching a horse race. One of the riders stopped his horse and took a picture of the hurdle, then walked around it instead of going over or between it."
"0722"	"(11/13/61)"	"I took out $4000 our of $5000 that belonged to someone else. I stole it from him. I was at the track with Frank Hardwood. I had a bunch of tickets for the main event. I counted the tickets. I had about 24 of them. I counted them about 3 times, then I said, ""I will have 12 and you two can split the other two."" They didn't like that, so I said, ""You have 15 of them and I the rest."" Still they didn't seem to be satisfied, so I said, ""Ok, we split them 3 ways,"" and that was satisfactory to them. I said, ""Now we split the money down the cent."" I left the track and I looked into a small box. There they had the horses or images of them. I looked at them and was not satisfied with it. I walked across the street into a drug store and there I sat down and was going to look at the program. The clerk came by and said, ""Whose boots are those on the floor?"" A lady clerk came by and picked them up and put them aside. Judy walked into a side street. I went after her and here she was in line with the school kids. I looked at her. She had mud around her mouth. She was eating mud again. I slapped her face a couple times and carried her down the street with Ann. I was down by the beach by Gordon Park. There was a girl with a rifle. She picked out a girl from the crowd and shot her. She was shooting at different objects on the beach. Then she pointed her gun at a woman with her husband, but it seemed she moved and she couldn't shoot at her. I asked her why she wanted to shoot her and she said she would be better off if she was dead. I said, ""You may be wrong,"" and she agreed, ""You may be right."" Then she turned into Tommy Lasko. He gave me the rifle because I said, ""Let me see how far this carries straight."" The gun had a scope. I pointed at an object and fired and I missed it. I went into a store and there were about 4 show windows with baked bread and it was baked so nice and brown. We were sliding down the steps. I helped someone's car to slow down or let down the steps slowly."
"0723"	"(11/14/61)"	"I saw a dustmate as winner or heard it or was repeating it. I was by my mother's home. I was slicing potatoes that were cooked. My sister Ann came over and took a piece to eat. I gathered a bunch of socks and took them into the kitchen and asked my sister Mary where she wanted them and she told me on the table. I looked outside in the front street and I saw a big derrick come on the street between Grandma's house and Harry's house, then it went back. I went outside and it backed up thru his yard and across the other lots on 74th St. I looked and this was a new street cut thru. It looked like it was right thru to 79th St. I was by Grandma's home again. I was lying in bed with Mary and was having intercourse with her. I came outside in the morning. The sun was just rising above the horizon. My mother and some of the neighbors were in their yards up with the sunrise. Someone dropped something into the toilet and broke part of the wall and the piece lay closing the drain hole. I saw Jimmy Evans running around on all fours and he just had his shirt on. I could see his sex organs. I looked at two smoke stacks. They were leaning over and there were men around the bottom. Then one stack started to fall. It shook the ground as it hit the earth and crumbled. Then the other stack went down and did the same thing. They were destroyed. Then I saw a man come by all excited. He said he thought the owner's daughter was in the way of one of the stacks. I was drinking out of bottles. It was liquor and it seemed I also drank hair tonic."
"0724"	"(11/15/61)"	"I was in a tree with Ann. She was washing the floor. I could see her vagina. Two Negroes and a white man were walking under the tree looking up. I yelled a command at them. I said, ""I will give you one minute to get off this property and if you are not, I'm going to use this shotgun on you. I'll blast you all to hell."" I looked at my watch's second hand and was timing them. They were off before the time was up. Joe Arendas got angry at me and was battling me. I got the best of him, so he played me dirt. He got a big can of acid and was going to throw it at me, but it opened as he raised it over his head and the acid was jelled and it poured all over him. He came at me with this jell over him. I moved out of his way and he went away to get the stuff off his body. He got a little on me, so I went under a hose and was washing off the acid. I was with the Gotch boys, my boyhood friends. We were throwing rocks around. I seemed to have my Uncle Jake and others around. I was talking with a dead man. He said his heart was still beating, but now he didn't need any oxygen or breathing to do. I was close to him against his face."
"0725"	"(11/16/61)"	"Ann and I went into a restaurant. She wanted a certain table. I went up to the desk to ask. Before I could ask the waiter gave me a ticket with the table number. It was 77-11-77. We went to the table and it was still soiled. Five men were sitting next to us. One of them was breathing heavy. We were separated by a long table. I was carrying a big man like a baby. He was heavy and pulled me down. I met Mrs. Rudic and her husband. He was a stranger to me. He was not Frank. I shook hands with Mrs. Rudic and then she introduced me to him. The kids were having fun. There was some kind of ducks or monkeys that would bounce up and make a pyramid as they landed."
"0726"	"(11/17/61)"	"Ann came home from work and she said she was going back in about 4 hours. I said it was up to her if she wanted to go. I walked into a church. I never saw such a big church. It had so many confessionals. I was carrying some object in my hands and I just wanted to pray, but there were so many people sitting in the rear of the church going to confession. I walked way to the left side, then finally sat down. Here I was with Ann, Joe O'Corn and Francis O'Corn. They were brother and sister, but in the dream they were husband and wife. Ann asked me if I would take her out that night and I said I wouldn't because she was tired. She got stubborn and said, ""Then I will go out with Joe O'Corn. Joe kind of blushed, but was willing. Francis whispered something into his ear and I know it was, ""You better not go with Ann."" She didn't want Joe to go with her. I told Ann what an old fool she was, going out with a teenager. She was really nuts. I was cleaning off a parked truck. I had to clean something on it, yet where I have to move the truck. So I gave it a little push and tried to stop it by holding it back, but it rolled over a little bump and ran into the side of another truck parking in the garage. The boss came over, said, ""That fool didn't have his brake on when he parked the car."" He was turning some kind of spinning shiny object that was on the truck. My sister Ann asked me if she could read one of my books. I said sure. I was working down in the flats. I came in and there were workers taking the machines apart. I was putting bars on a rack and it was too far apart. I had to move the stand closer. Mitchkash (deceased) was with me. Cecilia came over and talked to me. I put a blanket over and around myself and went into the locker room to get my clothes and the floor was all covered with tools and machine parts. I looked into the lockers and they were empty."
"0727"	"(11/20/61)"	"I saw Innocent. I was working at White's. Benny Meader was supervising. I worked one shift, was home about 4 hours, then came back and worked another 8 hours. I was working on machines. I gauged one job and the hole was too deep. I showed it to Benny and it was really too deep. Then we were working on some patch-up concrete work. Then I was at the track and some horses won, which I knew, but I can't recall them now. Louie Kauffman (deceased) was at the track with some hot coffee. He offered a man a drink and he said, ""Do you have a hooker in it?"" and he said no. So the man drank it. Then I looked how the track was, and I saw and heard, ""They run on a trail."" I saw one horse go and it was an airplane. He was coming around the bend and was sort of shaking, then he flew up and started to spin and I said, ""That's the end of him."" He spun fast like a propeller and came down, crashed and exploded. I knew the pilot was dead. I awoke and was lying, trying to fall asleep and I heard, ""Did you know Joe's dead?"" A fellow told me he was told that a horse by the name of this won. He wrote it in my book. He wrote that. I wrote this. He was puzzled how it was written. We were kidding the girls where we work. We would bring them cigars for it was our anniversary. I was eating and we had an old cake. Ann said, ""Do you think it is good?"" We tried it and it was good, so I ate it. I heard a fellow say Gus won."
"0728"	"(11/22/61)"	"I was working at Dill's. I was moving a long board back and forth. Otto was with a girl. She was quite small. I went to a school like, but I was nervous like or shy of people, so I walked by and away. I was spitting up slime. It was so sticky and hard that I was taking pieces out of my mouth and throwing it on the ground. Then I got hold of something like string and I pulled it out. I could feel it coming out down from my throat."
"0729"	"(11/25/61)"	"I was sleeping and awoke. The sun was shining and seemed to be west. I was puzzled whether it was morning or afternoon. I saw a man and his son coming home from somewhere and they were tired. The father dropped his coat a couple times, then the third time I picked it up for him and gave it to him. He just smiled. There was a big fly on the wall. It seemed to be flat. I swatted at it, but it got away, then landed on my face and crawled on my face. I had my hands full of something and couldn't hit it. So I blew at it, but it crawled around my mouth. I blew again and was afraid it would crawl into my mouth. I finally put down what I held and I hit at it. I don't know whether I hit it or not, but there was an awful odor. I think it was from the fly. I was repeating 3 cents. Ann told me Bob had a girlfriend and was much in love with her. There was a parade from the post office going by. I heard someone yell, ""Evans."" Ann, Judy and Barbara got into the parade. I picked up some object and was carrying it till I got by a steep hill. Then I said, ""No, I'm not carrying it up the hill."" Bob and I were swimming in a clean pool of water. It was about 3 ft. by 8 ft. deep and about 4 ft. deep. Bob dove in and was under water and came up, then I put my head under water. A man came by and said, ""You have a nice waistline. Look at me."" He was shorter than me and had a big belly. I was sitting in a chair on the porch. I commanded a big dice about three-inch square to move around and it did. Then I told it to float in the air and I commanded it to stop in mid-air and it did. Just then someone, a young girl, came in and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ""Dad."" I was angry she did that because I was having fun with the dice. I gave her a slap across the face. Andy and Emma Mayer came by and said I was asleep in the chair, but I still thought I was awake. I was going to school. I came to the school and I was late. I looked thru the door window and the class was in session. One of the students was reading out of a book. I got a little frightened that I would make a few mistakes in pronunciation and Bob was in my class. So I walked down the steps and went outside. There was a little fellow batting stones and he could bat one better than a fellow could throw to its target. He hit me with one in the foot and I threw one at him and hit him. Then I ran and he was after me. I was gone for quite awhile till my sister Sue came into the building where I was and looked into my place. I stood still like a statue and she went out and then looked back and at me and recognized me. They said  I finally bought myself a place. It was a good thing. I looked at Judy and she had a big needle embedded into her leg about an inch or more deep, and she had another needle in her hand. She tried to pull the needle out of her leg, but couldn't. I got a pair of pliers and pulled it out. Then we were going to north Roylton. I was sort of flying and it was foggy and the wind was blowing very hard. Judy was like a boy and Joey Duke was with us standing next to Judy. He was a little taller than Judy, but Judy's head was larger and her legs were heavier than Joey's."
"0730"	"(11/23/61)"	"I came to a cherry tree. It was full of black, ripe cherries. It was on a tree lawn. I went in and asked if I could pick some cherries and the woman said, ""Come in,"" and the man said I could pick the cherries, but he would hold the ladder as I picked and we would divide the cherries. I agreed with him. I seemed to have seen deep as a winner."
"0731"	"(11/24/61)"	"I was driving and there seemed to be someone near us running. I was afraid it would be a holdup so I speeded up. I was really going thru a mist like and they were hanging on. Then finally I didn't hear them after me. We were sitting on the back porch. A man walked by and I had a feeling he was up to something as he went by the corner of the house, so I looked off the porch around the house and sure enough, he was standing there planning on something. I had a scoop of ice cream. I threw it around the corner at him. Then I told everybody to go into the house. Fisher, I and J. Tesar were entombed in a cave or e were looking for an opening from the outside to save John Tesar inside. It is kind of jumbled up. We finally were free or he was free, but he was dead, John T. His body was dissected. His head was off and art of his legs were left. We were going to have a snapshot of this. Fisher and I were to be in the picture. Ann and I were shopping."
"0732"	"(11/25/61)"	"I was intimating a lady. I can't recall who she was. I was on top of her bumping my testicles against her vagina as my penis was going in and out, and I was looking into her eyes as I was doing it. I was traveling south with two men. We were up north in the wilds and they seemed to be going insane. They were talking of killing the first human they would see. I was planning on getting rid of them before they started their murder spree."
"0733"	"(11/27/61)"	"On two occasions I had a dream of horses that won, but I can't recall them now. We were in a hideout or cave and the boss didn't want any prints left anywhere. We took our shoes off and took out some packages, then came back in and I put on my shoes. We were talking about dancing barefooted. I took a few steps barefooted in dancing."
"0734"	"(11/28/61)"	"I was with my dad and Judy. We were looking at boots that Margie S. owned with her husband. We walked around looking at different things that were on display. Margie was showing us them and would explain the different things and items. I was walking on top of a pond or water. I stepped lightly, then when I tried to walk on top of deeper water, I started to sink above my ankles and got my pants wet. A man came to see me. He wanted to have my picture on shoe boxes and I said I would think it over. He was to contact me later. I was thinking how I would be known by many people by my dad."
"0735"	"(11/29/61)"	"I don't know what the charge was. Bob was in jail. I helped him to escape for a day and then he went back. One of the prison guards wanted a half dollar so Bob said, ""Let him Indian wrestle you for it."" So I did. I pushed his arm down, almost touched it, then he pushed mine about _ down, then I pushed his all the way down and then he didn't get the dollar. I was walking with the girl from Dill's with the big busts. She joked, ""Someone will think I am chasing you,"" and I said, ""So what if you are. It's nobody's business."" We were working at White's."
"0736"	"(11/30/61)"	"I was in bed with Ann. I had a hard-on. I told Ann, ""Can I have a piece? Look how hard it is. Feel it."" She reached over and felt it. Then she turned on her back and I was just getting on top of her and the alarm awoke me. Andy P. and I got a new job in a new place. Andy told me to look at a form tool the other man left for him. I took a good look at it and it was rough. Cannon was taking us through to our job."
"0737"	"(12/01/61)"	"I was in John Bicon's house. He lived up high on a dump. I looked thru the window and said, ""You sure are living high."" He was planning on having a fence built around his home. There was one part of the way. My sisters were setting and had the tables set with food for some kind of party or wedding for someone. Marty was up in John's house also. I had 4 horses from 1 to 5 written down and wanted to know which horses would win, and I heard or said S. 4 and I seemed to come to me."
"0738"	"(12/02/61)"	"I was outside and looked across the land and saw the clouds flying low. I went out and let some of the small clouds come to me like steam and they gave off a peculiar odor. Then I saw a cloud that was an image of rhinoceros. It floated low and I picked up a rock and was going to throw it at it and it seemed to be alive or acted so. It looked at me ready to throw the rock. It went around the other side of the barn. I was walking across a small stream of water. I had to jump across when I went over it, then came back. Bob had a high ladder against a high wall. He was tightening up wires from it."
"0739"	"(12/02/61)"	"I was called back to work to White's and I went down to see about it. This time I had to go or it was quits with White's. I met Ed Larson in the office. He sat there doing nothing, disgusted. I shook hands with him and said, ""Well, I have to come back this time, and I had 5 years or half of the pension at Dill's and now I must lose it."" He said his wife had to do the same thing. Then I saw girls come by with dress designs parading by. The last two girls were, to my surprise, the tallest people I ever did see or dream of. They were about 12 ft. tall. I looked back, amazed at their height."
"0740"	"(12/04/61)"	"I was in the country with my shotgun. I saw an animal run. I could have a shot it, but I didn't want to shoot it because the shot would fly over some of my friends' heads over the field. Time Honored came to me in my sleep. In my dream I said it came to me and we talked about someone's birthday it falling on. I took a ride in a young fellow's car. I climbed into the back seat and he didn't know till he stopped that I was with him. His car was long. It was bout 35 ft. long. I was flying. I flew above the trees, then came down lower. A couple old men were on the street and they thought I was some kind of bird or demon. One fellow tried to hit me with a stick. Then I was on top of a building and I jumped off and flew swiftly away. I was in a bus and there sat a small boy. He had a mustache. I asked him how old he was and he said 9. I was dancing with May Snider. I was holding Judy and another child. I was hugging and loving them up. I am not sure, but it seems I heard Jody."
"0741"	"(12/05/61)"	"We were in a cave or out in a dark field. I heard lions roaring. I think they were in a cage. Bob was a small boy. He had a skirt on and I was trying to pin it on his shirt so he would have cover for his sex organs. I was trying to hang something up by driving nails into good varnished wood. Seemed like a dresser or some kind of molding. I saw iii in the entries for the weight."
"0742"	"(12/06/61)"	"I was on a ship or it came in. I am not sure. The numbers were called 606 and 166, and a couple of other numbers. I looked down at the water. It looked like a small brook and still we said the boat will go down this stream to the ocean. The sailors were wading thru the shallow water to shore. I started to wade and I noticed I had a pair of hip boots on. The sailors were drinking some kind of pop out of bottles. We were outside and the clouds came low. The wind blew and I touched a scruped cloud and it started to snow. Then there was snow on the ground. A man asked for a hot tip and this fellow was indebted to the other fellow, so he gave this fellow the tip. He said scruped. We had a lot of company at our house, friends of our daughters and our friends and some of my wife's. One friend had a one-wheel lawn mower. I lay on the grass and he ran it over my cheek."
"0743"	"(12/07/61)"	"I saw a woman's head above the ground as though she were covered. I was going to throw a stone at her as she yelled at me. She was about 250 ft. away from me."
"0744"	"(12/08/61)"	"Ann and I went to a dance. As we walked along the street, we saw a big building that was built just lately and some of the old buildings were torn down. A colored man was walking and he made a motion with his hands from a habit he formed and Ann imitated him with his arm motions. Then she walked along lightly on her feet with a swing and I noticed she had a thin waistline from the back view. The entrance fee to the dance was one cent. I had some change in my hand. As I was picking out one cent, the usher was a small fellow, he stuck his fingers into my hand and took out a half dollar and some other change. I was saying something about a hill horse to myself. A priest came into a prison. He was going to give the last rites to a prisoner when he pulled out a pistol and shot the man. It was lunchtime. I was in the shop. So Ed and I went down to have our lunch. I slid down a banister rail. Then I found out I didn't have my lunch. A couple boys were hitting rocks with baseball bats. I took a bat from one of the boys and was batting the stones with the bat. I went outside and I had 4 flat tires. I knew some vandal had done it."
"0745"	"(12/09/61)"	"I was down the flats. I was in the old White building that I worked in and as I was coming out, there was a lot of broken glass on the sidewalk. I looked at it and it was the door windows and there were window washers washing windows. I said, ""I guess your ladder slipped and it fell on the windows and broke them,"" and he said, ""Yes, that's it."" Audrey was eating long pieces of hair. They must have been about 14 inches long. I was driving a new Pontiac, the highest price one. Ann bought it. I didn't want a big, high priced car like that, but she did it. I was looking underneath the car and I noticed it was kind of rusted and not so good. One of the tire valves was leaking air. I tried to stop it by inserting and pushing the needle in and out of the valve stem, but it kept on leaking air. My car, an old Pontiac, was leaking oil. It was all over the dah in puddles. I was cleaning it up."
"0746"	"(12/10/61)"	"I found a sword in our house. Ann said my sister Sue gave it to us. I took it and went over to Grandma's and Sue was there. I walked in like a soldier. Sue said, ""Where did you get the sword?"" I said, ""You brought it to our house,"" and she said, ""Oh, yes I did."" I was piling up doughnuts in a plate at Grandma's. I was picking out a horse out of one of the races and Ann and Bob were looking at the notes I wrote. Ann was erasing something. She wrote in my dream book notes. I was going to play Just Waiting. I think #4 was the horse I was picking out of the 6th race. I was working and I noticed we had a gang of visitors. They were schoolboys. They lined up the two aisles. Carl Fisher was sleeping in a sitting position and made off he was looking at some work. Nelson gave me two pieces of his work and I tried to screw them together, but one piece had no thread. I looked inside the hole and there was a thread where the hole was smaller. I was again in the shop and the visitors were still in there. I got the paper from one of the men and I looked at it. I was lying in a bed on our line, a beautiful girl walked by the other line. I was admiring and imagining how I could love her. I took a little run and jumped over a pile of bananas on the end of the line. Fisher also jumped over them. I saw Malley in the dept. It was a jump of about 8 ft."
"0747"	"(12/11/61)"	"I had a paddle and I hit a cat with it up into the air. Then later I hit that cat again and I hit her hard. She went up about 25 ft. When she landed, she bounced like a ball about 3 times. I thought I would give her a real hard bat, so I ran after her and then finally hit her and she turned into a green tomato. I could see the dent in the tomato where I hit it. A kid was shooting his cap gun at a grasshopper. He put the gun close to the grasshopper and shot. The grasshopper would jump a couple times, then the boy would get close to him and shoot it again. I had a different number of the sixth at Pimlico."
"0748"	"(12/12/61)"	"I played 3 horses in a reverse and I won. I was doing some kind of work with Fisher. There wasn't much of it and a lot of people were working on it. A forelady was calling for a hay patcher. Carl said, ""Go, you like that work."" I said I had a cold and it would make me sneeze. Then I saw a gang smearing old oil on a road. I was in a small shanty nude and a woman came in with me and I let some gas out. She said, ""It smells bad in here."""
"0749"	"(12/13/61)"	"I saw four fires and all were started by two firebugs, two of them by each firebug. I was unraveling a salesman's traveling coat. I ran and flew to each fire and also yelled fire each time. I was a soldier and we were being trained. I was watching a man work. He was sitting on a chair. I looked at his legs. His calves were shriveled and so thin. He had nothing but bone and skin. He got up and when he tried to move, he had a hard time moving his feet. He got tangled up with his shoes. He fell down on his chair. Ann tried to adjust his chair, but couldn't. She called for Mike to come and help her. I was working at White's again. We finished our job for the day, then I went to see one of the personnel men and he said he would put me on a job on premium. I said, ""It's okay, just so it isn't a punch press."" I went downstairs to change my clothes. I walked thru a hallway and I came to a school room where boys were being schooled. Then there was a torture room and I was one who was going to be tortured. I was waiting for my turn. I went outside and the lake was frozen over. People were skating. I saw Whitey Volker and another man. I talked to them. I had a stick and it was candy. I licked it."
"0750"	"(12/14/61)"	"I was walking thru a field and there were big blackberries. They were so big, about 1-1/2 inches square. I knew they were not free, but I picked some and ate them. When I got to the corner of the field, I had to climb over the fence and the farmhouse was near there. I heard the farmer say to the boy, ""The berries are $4 a quart."" I had an idea he wanted me to hear that. I yelled at him, ""I will give you $1."" I ate about a dollar's worth. I heard this was going to be an air raid alert and it did come. The sirens went off and I saw a big missile on the ground. I heard them say it was 90 ft. long. I saw some planes. They looked like rockets go up. I looked at some land where it was dammed. It was to be filled with water later. I was looking for Marty. I found him. When the alert went off, it got dark. I was walking up a very steep hill."
"0751"	"(12/15/61)"	"I was up on top of a high building. Eddie Lasko was there with me. I walked into a showroom where there was a contest on grapes. I saw a woman walk into the place with a beautiful bunch of grapes and she said to the other woman, ""This should win."" I had to squeeze thru a small opening and I got myself dirty. I was looking for Bob. He was lying in the basement relaxing and I didn't see him. I met Tommy Lasko and he asked me where Ann was. I was working in the shop. I looked at a big rack of stock of bars. I won something in a context on TV. It was worth $5,000. I said I was going to go on and take the $5,000, not try to win more and lose what I had won."
"0752"	"(12/16/61)"	"I was riding a motorcycle. I was cleaning some furniture."
"0753"	"(12/17/61)"	"I was working in Dill's. All at once it was dark and I couldn't see. I felt my way to the switchboard and tried to put on the lights, but they wouldn't go on. I was ducking the watchman Clem for some reason or other, I can't recall now. Ann told me her brother Frank died. Judy had a piece of hair sticking out of her mouth. I got hold of it and pulled it out and when I got thru pulling the hair out, there was a bunch like my fist. I was watching Hilts and Kotnik run some machines. They had big pipes standing upright. I looked up because they would let the pipes fall down for a reloading. A fellow was talking with me. He talked about a girl that said, ""It will be $7,"" and he said, ""It's not worth that much."""
"0754"	"(12/18/61)"	"I was looking at the sky. The wind was starting to blow hard. I was intimating a woman. There were a lot of men in the shop. It was like our job. The boss came by and said, ""None of you men came, so do it again."" I wiped away the dirt from the hole which looked like a hole in anything. Then I did it and came."
"0755"	"(12/19/61)"	"I played two horses and I didn't know if they won, but Benie Minkus, he had a horse by the name Minkus. He won and paid $12 or $94. I told him so I was flying. The wind was keeping me up. John Tesar (deceased) was also flying. He tried to catch me. I tried to fly fast and keep out of his reach, but he caught up to me. I saw his youngest son and I asked how old he was. He said his son Jimmie was 20. My son Bob was near. I said, ""Look at my son Bob. He is only 16 and is as tall as me. He is taller than you."" I was down at White's. Louis Kaufman was the foreman (deceased). I had a hard-on and I just seemed to have a shirt on only. I tried to hide it as much as possible. Then I noticed I had pants on. I went outside and I saw Swifty walking by. He was looking for work. I told him to go in and see Louie and he walked in to see Louie. I was standing by a window looking out at a big tree that the wind was blowing back and forth as if someone was breaking it loose from the roots. Then I said, ""Let's move away. It's going to fall on the house,"" and sure enough, it fell down on the house. We looked out and there were other trees around and they were as calm as could be. I said, ""It was the devil that knocked that tree down."" I was pounding nails into objects on a bench and a pheloscopic was here. He said, ""Keep repeating you are not going to steal"" and you will be involved in stealing."
"0756"	"(12/20/61)"	"Fisher and I were working with Malley McPhail. He seemed to be in movie making. I went down the street a ways and Malley was backing up his panel truck down the street. He must have backed it about 3 blocks. I wondered why he didn't turn around and drive forward. My dad and brother Steve were working. They came to the clock and I with them. Malley was down looking at something and was in our way. He got up fast. I was surprised. We punched out time and went out. I met Andy Palider working in the stock room. We walked to a door and there was a drop of about 13 ft. Andy wanted me to jump down. He gave me a little push, but I hung on and said, ""That's a little too high. You will jar your body too much."" He jumped down. I think I jumped before at a distance of about 10 ft. height before. We were talking of directions with Malley. He said east was in back of us. I looked in that direction and the sun was rising. We went into the back house on E. 68th St. I looked and there was Trixie, our old dog. She was dead. Her head was on the floor and part of her body was there. They were apart, the head and the body. I told Bob to take it away. I took Judy in the shop down into the flats and the girls liked her. I gave her a sandwich. She ate it, then puked it up. We were playing with a small baby. She would expel water thru her mouth."
"0757"	"(12/21/61)"	"We were at a party. I see one man fall over. Bill Freedman got over him and he seemed to be dead. Bill held his eyes open with his fingers and he dipped his head under water. Then he would bring him up. He seemed dead. He was given up as dead. Bill's wife was yelling Uncle Craig. After he was given up as dead, all at once he came to life and he was surprisingly young. He came over and stuck his hand down on my sex organs and I was struggling to get away. I finally did. I was kicking a ball around with some men and kids. I was running after a fellow just in fun. I was watching a man pass a test. He did some very great feats to become a priest. I went to a different place to pass the test. A man asked for three copperhead snakes. He held them in front of me. I got hold of one's mouth and ripped him open. Then I got the other two and pulled off their heads and threw them into a water puddle. The man paid no attention to what I was doing. He thought it was my end, but he was surprised when he saw the beheaded snakes in the water. I did the same with rattlesnakes before the copperheads. I passed the test. The man met John Lasko (deceased) and showed John what I did to him when I met him before the test. I made a dare of gouging out his eyes or poking at them. I met Helen and June Lasko."
"0758"	"(12/23/61)"	"Audrey was in the dentist's. She had a stem or branch of her teeth growing out about an inch and about 1/16 in diameter. She had two in the front upper teeth. I told Dr. Cooperman about them and he looked it over and said from her baby teeth. I said that would have to be cut off. We were riding in a streetcar and Bob left his shoes in the car. So I went back to the streetcar which was small about 8 passengers and I got his shoes. I was looking at a drawing of the city CTS railway. I told Audrey to go to route 306 and drive on it to her designation."
"0759"	"(12/24/61)"	"We were walking along a street, then all at once we ran. There was a big, high telephone post falling or looked like falling. When we got out of the way, we looked at the post and it was long and way higher. It was tied to the top with long ropes. The post men were setting it into a hole and had to hope those ropes tied to the top of the post because it was such a long post. It must have been about 20 ft. long. Charlie Charvat was with me when we ran from under the post. We sat on someone's back porch and were looking at the sky, which was getting ready for a storm. I heard the young fellow in the house accusing us as suspects of a murder. He came out later and had a gun in his hand. He got Charlie, then came at me, pointing the gun at me. I raised my hands and he accused us of murdering Arendas. I said, ""We didn't kill no one. You can take us to the police and they will let us free because we are innocent."" He was puzzled and then was deciding to take us somewhere with his friend and beat us up. I said, ""Oh no, you're not going to do that. You take us to the police and we will be freed."" While he was thinking of what to do, I picked up the gun he threw away and I forced him to take off the handcuffs. He did and we went to his basement and got in our car and we were blocked by him and his friends. I didn't want to run over them and that convinced him we were innocent. We were outside talking as friends. A half dollar fell out of my pocket and rolled near two men who were sitting. They both saw the half dollar when it stopped rolling and were oozing up to it backwards to pick it up, but I picked it up and we watched the two reach to pick it up and there was no money there, to their surprise. They looked and it was gone. I came to a place where there were men sitting at a gambling table. Jack Lasko was one and he had 6 sixes that was high and winner of $600, but the man said something, he didn't want him to win now because he would be pinched for a gambling charge. I saw about 4 sevens and 4 fives that others had. I counted the 6 sixes. My dad and I were climbing up on top of a shanty. He said, ""Let's see how high you can kick,"" so I had my foot on the top and I kicked up and said, ""Look how high I can kick."" We then got on the top and sat there. I met Rose Lasko. I started to love her up. I was kissing her and feeling her up at the same time. Carter was doing exercise on the floor. When he was through, he got hold of Bernice's gown or what she was sitting on and he pulled it from under her. She fell back on her back and her vagina was exposed. She had no hair on or around it. She was embarrassed as we looked on and Carter got a kick out of it."
"0760"	"(12/25/61)"	"I was operating B and S at White's. I had 4 machines to operate. Then on a different day I had #59 to operate. I had a hard time finding it, but finally found it. The machine was in a big section where there were several machines on a panel. I only had a couple buttons to operate and the screws or bolts came out and I gauged the thread on a gauge."
"0761"	"(12/26/61)"	"We lived in a schoolhouse. It was a big brick building. There was a playground in the front of it. I said, ""Look, now we live in the schoolhouse and the playground is right in front of it. We don't seem to get away from the kids."" We were working at White's and there was not much work. The men were just loafing, putting in their time. I looked at one of my friend's eye and he had a brass chip floating in it. I said, ""Let me take it out,"" and he said, ""The nurse does a good job of it. I'm going into the dispensary."" Someone was selling sewing machines. They had a price on them and if cash was paid within 30 days, a $25 deduction was given from the $125. I argued that the machine was a $100 item; why try to fool the people?"
"0762"	"(12/27/61)"	"Someone, a woman and man, walked into a bank and were walking out the back way when I accused them or suspected them of robbing the bank. I went into the mountains where there were deer. Then I was back in the bank and someone walked in with the stolen loot. They brought it back."
"0763"	"(12/28/61)"	"I saw Know This. He ran 3rd. We seemed to have moved into another house and it was full of small snakes. I was stepping and tramping on them, killing them. There were hundreds of them. We would put out the lights for a while, then put them on again and the snakes would come out and we would start stomping them to death. A small boy sat in a boat. It was drifting out into the water. I picked up a pole and tried to reach him. As I did, waves began to come in and it moved the boat out of reach. The mother screamed, I jumped into the water, big waves started to come in and I swam for my life to get to shore and I made it. I was supposed to marry a 15-year-old girl. I went to church with John Yankura, but I didn't get married. There was a good harvest of a fruit of some kind. I can't recall what it was, but we took it home. I saw Grapevine One or #1 was supposed to win the first or last race. I don't know which race. Ed, the fellow from White's with a hand missing, came into Andy Palider's store and said to Andy, ""Boy, Obsession is a sure winner. I would put my whole pay on him."" I said, ""No horse is a sure thing. He can fall and break his leg."" I was loving up Andy's clerk. She wanted to be loved, so I was kissing and caressing her. I had a hard-on and she said, ""It's hard to. I think if I spread my legs, you would put it in,"" and I said, ""I don't know; I never did this before."" Then some customer came in and a lady wanted to see something that she had to go and show her. I went out and came later, and I peeked around the corner and she saw me. I went in and we sat on a chair for two. I was loving her when two lady customers came in and they remarked, ""Look how red his face is. He is blushing."" I don't know if I was, but Andy was standing near and he was blushing."
"0764"	"(12/29/61)"	"We were coming in to work. Malley McPhail said, ""Now stop."" We stopped and he asked one young fellow, ""4 X 12 = what?"" The fellow said 56. We said 48. That is how many of us were in out of 150 employees."
"0765"	"(12/31/61)"	"I was in the country. I saw two bulls and a small puny cow. One bull tried to mount the cow, but she always moved when he tried. I was watching them. Then the other bull tried to do the same, but didn't succeed. I was digging Frank Kogler's yard up. I dug into a treasure. It was a 2 lb. can full of pennies. I took a few of them and looked over a few of them to see if there were any Indian heads, but I didn't see any. I had the ground kind of piled up as I dug. I saw Kogler out of his house. I motioned to him I dug up his pennies. He made off as though he didn't' know of it, but then remembered. I was looking for a part-time job. There were coke ovens and I asked the man if I could draw one each day, but he made alibis that it was taken. I was on St. Clair Ave. Carl Fisher won a bowling trophy. A couple of couples came over and one of the young men bought an item from Carl and he was interested in the trophy. He asked Carl how much the trophy was worth and Carl said, ""I will sell it to you for $8 and it is worth $17 or $18."" The man didn't take it because he thought Carl would sell it for about $4."
"0766"	"(12/31/61)"	"I was painting on a wall, then I was using the small brush and was painting the date on a tree. I was looking into drawers for vegetables. There were dried green beans with the skin or whole bean off the plant."
"0767"	"(01/01/62)"	"I was on the street and the wind started to blow very hard. I hid behind some store buildings and it seemed as though it was going to blow the windows thru. Then I went on the corner of one building and looked down a side street and there about 500 ft. away I saw the cone of a tornado moving across the street, touching it like a giant elephant trunk. I was riding by one of my daughter's who was holding a baby boy in her arms. I passed. I yelled, ""Hello there, you little redhead."""
"0768"	"(01/02/62)"	"I was riding with a fellow who drove the wrong way into a one-way street. He drove over the curb to get out of the way of the traffic. Then he was turning into another side street and I said it was also the wrong way into a one-way street. I was holding a wet white sheet in a glass doorway at night and the street lights reflected on the street and threw a bright light on the street. I was with a small boy that came to the city and was going to see the editor of a paper for a story of a murder or something that was not quite right in its meaning. I was playing ball with the boys. They drove long flies. I was near the track and I saw #9 on the board that was supposed to be the favorite. The race was 1-1/4 mile. I wanted to dream what p.p. was going to win the 9th race at Tropical Park. I was going to play the #9. I had the paper in my pocket. When I took it out to see what the name of the horse was, I couldn't find the entries page."
"0769"	"(01/04/62)"	"Marty came up to me. He said his brother-in-law was getting $206. He had a two-horse reverse, some slinger or swinger and I can't recall the other horse. Then he gave me a $20 bill and a $3 bill. I said, ""This is no good. There is no $3 bill,"" and it was torn in half. There were two salt shakers or something like them which stood for $2. I put them in my pocket. We bought a new Pontiac. The paint job was bad. It was rough and a little pitted. I looked it over closely. I was driving it around. When Marty came up to me, he gave me a sack cloth bag with the money in it. There was loose change and bills. Then he took the bag or sack back and he gave me the money I mentioned before. I made a jump, and was going to beat someone on a big jump. He was looking for a place to make the jump. When I was driving the new Pontiac, I noticed the two front side doors were vibrating or loose. I pushed them and they were not caught on the latch. They were like swinging doors."
"0770"	"(01/06/62)"	"I was fixing a wall hammer attachment. Joe Sanrellow put up one of those attachments on the wall. There was a strong and tough druggist. Two boys came up to him and got tough with him. He just hit them and over they went. They went and got their gang and came back. The druggist hit the two boys again. He didn't see the rest of the gang. They got out of their hiding places and jumped the druggist. They picked him up and he was asking for mercy. I gave directions to a girl who was going to a post office in town. I was driving and I came to a narrow road and U-shaped with a  traffic light. Some of the traffic went thru on the red, but I waited for the green. I asked myself if 4 and 20 would win today and I visualized people, what they seemed to think of 4 and 20 winning today, and their heads seemed to start to nod yes, then they disappeared. I saw one face with a big hook nose and asked, she started to nod yes. I heard her say Vicky."
"0771"	"(01/07/62)"	"C. Fisher was buying bb's and he spilled some on the floor. He had the clerks and some of the customers picking them up. I also picked some up. Ann was in the armed service."
"0772"	"(01/08/62)"	"I was operating machines at White's. I was counting them. Pete Arendas came in. He was a doctor. When he came in, the women went around him and I had to look up and between the women to see who it was, and I saw Pete's face. We were in Gordon Park. I saw a big hawk fly down low. I said, ""Look,"" to my friends, ""how low the hawk comes when we don't have our guns."" Then about three more hawks flew down with the other hawk. Mike Anthony was paying Bob for his work for him. He was counting the bills on three piles on Bob's lap. He counted $15. Bob said to me, ""I'm glad I made that much."" I had some new dream books. They were the size of this one, only about three times longer. I was looking at one and Kolesar had one of my books looking at the first page. I took it away from him and said, ""Nobody reads these books, not even my wife."" I was looking for a place to hide the books because we were going hunting. I was caressing a beautiful girl. I was going to kiss her, but she wouldn't let me. I looked at her sweet lips and wanted a kiss, but she moved away. I saw a big frame up of wood which was going to be pulled to a private lake. We were going to shop by Buy Rite and as we got near the store was a big long truck and trailer. It was moving away on the street. Ann bought some stuff that was left there she thought was a bargain. I walked down a hill to a river."
"0773"	"(01/09/62)"	"I was hunting bear. It was dangerous. The bears were in caves and one could come out and surprise you. My sister Mary was holding a small baby about 4 or 5 months old, and I was surprised that the baby could speak talk. Then Mike's baby boy was very small, about the same age, and he said, ""He's a very nice boy."" I was waiting in a downtown restaurant for a meal. I was lying down covered with a blanket while the other people were standing in line. My sisters Mary and Sue had the tickets for the special meal. The meal was ready. The proprietor motioned for us to come in and Mary and Sue were not there. They finally came into the line and handed the tickets to the proprietress now and she said, ""Evans, come in now."" I got up from my cover and was scantily dressed. We walked to a table and Sue moved over a little and I sat on a plank next to brother Mike. He had on his sleeping pajamas. He said, ""What a dump."" We sat on boards."
"0774"	"(01/12/62)"	"I was taking out Silver Dollars out of a pillow. Then later I was picking up money on the street, all change that people lost. I dreamed something of two or double of a kind. I met a lady that I was going to associate with as some kind of society. I was outside and I was surrounded by a gang of hoodlums. I yelled for help by calling someone by name. Then I kind of talked to the boys and they turned out to be good fellows and wanted to be my company. I saw Cecilia Lippert. She was walking down the street wiggling her rear like the twist. She was looking for me. I was walking with John Arendas (deceased) and I made off I didn't want to see Cecilia as we walked by her."
"0775"	"(01/13/62)"	"Denny Latimer was hitting a golf ball around. He was hitting it back and forth by me. I was going to catch it on two occasions, but it came by too fast and I thought it would sting my hands. He was hitting the ball as it flew by him like a fellow would hit it with a baseball bat. Then Denny turned into Bob Hope and he had on a dress like and his pants shown below the dress. I was looking him over, what an outfit for golfing. I was also thinking of his fame, how he lived and he was just a human like me, but was well known and famous. His aunt was staying with him in one of the cottages. Mike Polca bought a home in Rivertown. There was a barn or stable on the lot. it was $1,800. Mike didn't want it. Hilts was going to buy it. He said that would give him more room for his machines. I looked at the barn. It was kind of narrow. Dave Cooper was working in a place. He got a crate and told me to help him to carry it up the steps. He walked up fast and I had a hard time to keep up with him. The boy that worked in that stockroom would give signals that he didn't want a certain party to know there was a certain package for a certain party."
"0776"	"(01/15/62)"	"I seemed to be working making the parts or some kind of part like a barrel with counter sinks. I made a drawing of a telescope with a pencil. I was driving and parked my car. Then it was a bicycle. A boy parked his bicycle next to mine and it also was red. He started to take his bicycle and I yelled to him, ""That is my bicycle,"" and he said it was his. Then I looked and my bicycle was still parked next to his. I was working at White's and we were talking how we were laid off for quite a while. Bob was hunting. I heard a shot or I stepped on a bank where I could see the hunters. There was snow on the ground. I saw Bob come over the hill and go thru deep snow. Then I heard a shot. I looked and Bob was running after the rabbit. He was running down the street. Then I saw the rabbit run across the snow and Bob was after him. I got some money from Marty. I looked out the window in the shop and the davenports and acmes were outside and were being operated full blast."
"0777"	"(01/16/62)"	"We were in Florida. I was on the beach. There was sand all over. There were battles on the beach, shooting at one another. We hid behind a wall and the other guys were shooting holes in the wall. I went on the shore and I put my feet into the ocean water and said, ""Now I can say I was in the ocean water."" Then I had a feeling. I took a dive deep and then started to swim for the top. I was going fast and was holding my breath. I saw the rattlers of a big rattle snake in a pool of water. I got a stick and I saw the big rattler's head sticking out of a hole. I started hitting away at his head. He moved slowly and his head pulled into the hole, but the stick was bent and pointed, so I kept on hitting him with the point. Later I saw him again and he was supposed to be a pet. I came close to him and he didn't go for me. I went into one of the buildings on the beach and the windows were closed and there was air conditioning. I said, ""That's nice when it is too hot."" Then I was in Florida again. I was flying and Otto was so tall, he must have been about 20 ft. tall. He reached me before I could fly higher. I looked in the paper and I saw Flying wave. I am not quite sure it was wave. It was in the last race 1 p.p. I said it was at Tropical Park and I said, ""I can go to the track and play it."" I had a woman in the house. I was going to intimate her. I had a hard-on. I called her into the next room and was going to do it to her just as someone knocked on the door and my sister Mary walked in."
"0778"	"(01/17/62)"	"I saw an old man. He wanted to play football with the boy when I came up close to him. He was not so old. He got a monocle from a fellow and put it to his eye. It made a double vision. I could see two eyes and when he looked at two eyes, it was four. My sister Sue came from PA and brought some catsup pies and my brother Steve and I said we didn't like them. I said cabbage was the best. I took them back to the rubbish and there was a 4 ft. hole in the ground to put the rubbish in."
"0779"	"(01/18/62)"	"Brother Steve (deceased) and I went to Uniontown to see Seventick and his wife. He is (deceased). I was brushing off dust off the easy chair. They moved there lately. They had a dog and I asked them if the dog got used to the new home. There was a storm coming. I went outside and looked at the sky. It was overcast. It was lightning and thundering when we were in the house. We left and were standing by the curb to cross the street. A policeman was standing there with his horse. He would whisper something to his horse to make him come to him. We were filing or sawing wood at Dill's. Malley McPhail was standing and watching us at work. Then he said, ""We work tomorrow."""
"0780"	"(01/19/62)"	"I was sitting on a small boat on the water. We were in a pool that was behind a break wall. I looked out along the shore and the wind was blowing offshore. The waves right offshore were about 3 ft. high and as they went out, I could see them going up about 20 ft. and higher. I said, ""I never saw waves starting on shore so high."" They usually are ripples first, but here the waves were offshore like they came off and Ann was supposed to be a beauty. I was a friend of hers. I whispered to her I wanted to see a certain part of her body and she would expose it to me. I wanted to see her busts and she put them thru a hole in a cloth she had and exposed them to me."
"0781"	"(01/20/62)"	"Judy had some kind of clothes or material and she wanted everything dressed in it. So I dressed myself and her dolls in the material. I can't recall the color. It was one color. It was night. I looked up and saw a giant big plane fly by. It seemed that it carried at least 500 people. A policeman came by and said, ""I would like to arrest a man today."" He said, ""That man that broke your window."" I said, ""Yes, that guy."" I heard ""Force Me."" Marty and I went into a telephone booth. There was a light on and I could see my money and my figures. I paid him what I owe him."
"0782"	"(01/21/62)"	"I was looking at some clamps on a bookend. It was supposed to indicate a road and these clamps were new, which meant a new road."
"0783"	"(01/23/62)"	"I had a screen from a window. I held it in both hands and used it was a wing and I flew against the wind. I stopped where Rose Lasko, my Uncle John and other people had a picnic. I knew this was a dream and I looked at the people and they looked so real. I got home. I was nude. I had only a book to cover me. I wanted my Uncle John to get out of my way so I could get my clothes and dress. I was bashful. I closed the door when he came down the stairway."
"0784"	"(01/25/62)"	"Andy Kohut was with me. I started to run. I ran by him and thought he couldn't catch me, but he came up fast as we ran and passed me. I met a girlfriend of mine. I talked to her and her husband was in a hospital. My wife was in the hospital visiting someone. I was in the car all dressed up and I noticed I had on my old shoes and I was going to a dinner."
"0785"	"(01/27/62)"	"I was in a doctor's office with Judy and some other small child. They were restless children. The doctor was ready to operate and he said, ""John, make me a little shot."" I was in an old house. The facilities were like olden times. No bathroom sink or toilet in house, floors were bare or rough boards. I saw a tiger and some goats leap into the bush. Later I saw one goat down and the tiger was chewing on the goat's hind quarters and the goat lay still, then moved a little, but couldn't do anything but look at his fate."
"0786"	"(01/28/62)"	"I was in our old home on East 68th St. Pauline Lenarcic was in the basement washing clothes. We were talking about the metal in the machines. A fellow brought a belt like with the metal it was made of. I looked it over and felt it. It seemed like a cloth although it was metal. I was in the dark. It was night. I put on my flashlight, but no light went on. I went outside and it was raining."
"0787"	"(01/29/62)"	"Frank and I were so small, about as big as an ant. We were on some rocks near the lake. We had to slide off the rocks to shore, which we did. I pushed open a window on two occasions to put a pillow into the shop."
"0788"	"(01/30/62)"	"I was around where they were building something and there were holes or trenches and part of them were covered and some were open. I told a fellow to buy or get me something and he would win a raffle. He did and something went wrong and he was after me. I ducked into one of the holes and he ran by me. Then I came out and I made off I was someone else. I threw away some of the end tickets and it was a winner. We were playing with a toy train. The cars would turn over and fall on one section of the track. I was told that the cars were looking for girlfriends and there was a little chipped off once in a while and that is what makes the cars wreck. I was parking a car and it wouldn't hold on a grade. I put it in gear and it held there. I bought a four-wheel cart or buggy. It had rubber wheels and I was pushing it home over the bridge and up a hill by some tough chained watchdogs. When I put on the emergency brake on the car the brake handle came out about twice as far as it does. It must have been broken because it would not hold the car on a small grade."
"0789"	"(01/31/62)"	"Carl and I were looking in a form. He was reading the story of a colored boy. I heard something of a go. There was a picture of a boy. I was watching a boy talking to girls. He was treating them very nice, offering them meals for free."
"0790"	"(02/01/62)"	"I had four horses on a piece of paper and wanted to know which horses would win today. I heard first and second, or it seemed I did."
"0791"	"(02/02/62)"	"I rode down the flats by White's. It was kind of quiet. I saw a watchman. I asked him what happened and he said it was past quitting time. I looked at my watch and it was about 5 o'clock and they quit at 4:30. A young fellow came up to us. He had no clothes on, just held his coat in his hand and covered his sex organs. His penis was long and was hanging below his coat. He held his hand over his organs and still his penis was hanging below. I looked at my wife Ann to see if she was looking at him, but she was not. She was embarrassed. He turned sideways and he had a long and flat nose. It just seemed to be cut off flat. He was ugly. He was covering his sex organs with his hand a few times."
"0792"	"(02/03/62)"	"I was awaking, I said 4 if C8R. I was taking bottles out of cases and I saw a case of pop. The name was Chit. I was home and my pants ripped from the waist to the cuff on one side. I put on another pair of pants and the seam came loose and they were open down all the way like the other pair. May Schneider was sitting on our davenport with one of her children. I looked at her and gave her a smile and she gave me a nice smile. My dad came home and said he was working in the post office and made $10 for 5 hrs. work. I had a dream of Ernest Koelpin, but I can't remember what it was about."
"0793"	"(02/04/62)"	"I wanted to dream which horse would win in race #6. There were 8 horses. I saw 4-4 flashing in a neon light. I was fixing some object that didn't work and it worked."
"0794"	"(02/05/62)"	"I was catching earthworms and was eating them. I almost nauseated when I did it. I was buying something, but can't remember what."
"0795"	"(02/06/62)"	"Ann and I were in Pick and Pays and we bought about $19 worth of groceries and we got a praise from A & P employee. He said by us buying caused the company to give us a raise in wages. Then I bowled over a 200 average and I was praised on this. Then I was in a contest. I was mopping up a floor with water. This was a contest. My Uncle John won some prize by hitting some kind of contest pin when bowling. I was in a store buying a pencil and a rubber band and an undercutter for a groove in the pencil. I was going around and up on some kind of elevator. I met Bill Grove and Leroy in the store. Leroy told me of a horse and I saw it in the paper, but I can't recall the name now. I looked behind the counter in a grocery store and the floor was shredded with sugar boxes that fell and the clerks were so busy that had no time to pick them up. We seemed to have been under an attack by nuclear attack and it was over. There was a beetle or bug on Bob's clothes. It had a cover made of metal. We came to our homes and there seemed to be no damage to them. Ann said, ""Take off your coat and let's do some work."" I took it off and there was that beetle on my clothes. I shook him off. He fell on the floor with the other beetles. I didn't like him, so I stepped on him. Now he was as big as my foot and he was hard, couldn't crush him with my foot and weight. I looked at him. He was now bigger yet and I noticed this was a manmade shield or cover because I saw the rivets on the metal. I met John Chipka. He had his paycheck and I saw 57 hrs. time. He worked with the maintenance gang at Dill's. We went to the table to eat and he sat on the chair I use, so I took one chair away from the table. I carried it about 50 ft. and sat it down. The bug was about 20 ft. away from me. He was working his legs and I thought he would fly and come at me."
"0796"	"(02/07/62)"	"I was driving my car backwards at night because I could not see where I was going. Bob had two baseball bats. I picked them up and swung them both at once and said, ""It would be easier to hit the ball with both bats."" Mr. Cooker said Dave had about 8 friends and that was too many. Mrs. Cooker was in the backyard and her hair was all messed up. She looked a sight. I saw one horse which won and paid $22. I was supposed to have him. I said, ""That will give me $11."""
"0797"	"(03/11/63)"	"I was looking at the results and I saw a long horse won and I saw a flying horse won and the mutuals were $225. There seemed to be a #16 winner also. I saw a racing horse with a jockey walking by on the racetrack. I saw other winners, but can't recall them now."
"0798"	"(03/12/63)"	"I was talking with Ann. I saw a monkey face and I told her a colored man looks like a monkey. Then I looked at Ann and her face looked like a monkey's. I told her so. Her head was just like a monkey's, hair and all.  I looked at her and said, ""I saw you once before and you had a monkey head on before."" She went into the other room, then came back and I said, ""You still have a monkey face."" Then it changed back to her own face and I said, ""Now you look yourself again."" Judy was kissing her mother and she was sticking out her tongue and Ann said, ""Don't do that, Judy. That's no way to kiss."" I said, ""You kiss like this,"" and I kissed Ann. I saw flying in the entries. I was going to fry some food. I was pouring soiled or used fat that was black into a container and it was full and running over and all over the floor. I got some sawdust and covered the oil to absorb it. A fellow started to mop up the sawdust with a mop. I said it would be better to use a broom because the grease will stick on the mop and get it all greasy, which will be hard to get off, and it also would not come off the floor. I was digging in the ground or spading the garden."
"0799"	"(03/13/63)"	"I was flying low and had a hard time going up. I was in Rivertown behind the schoolhouses of my boyhood days. I flew between apple trees and I noticed the apples were square shape. Then there was a commotion in a tree and two squirrels were fighting. One seemed to be the tougher. One bit the other one on the soft part of the mouth and also the squirrels were big or large as a full grown cat. I was in a space rocket with a space man. He was ready to take off and I said, ""How do I get out?"" He told me how. Ann said, ""Now I will not tell you how to use the detergent in the washers. You use it yourself and learn how."""
"0800"	"(03/13/63)"	"There was a colored man who worked in the post office in our home. He was sitting on a chair in a corner of the room. Ann walked up to him, then she put her hands on his chest and was pushing him against the wall. He had a hold of her arms as she was doing this. I yelled at them. I said, ""You black bastard, you let go of her, and if I catch you touching my wife again, I will knock the hell out of you."" He got up from the chair and walked out without saying a word. I was in some kind of office and the phone was ringing. I didn't answer it, but Ann came in and answered it. She said some boy called and said Bob was supposed to put brake lining on his car today. I said, ""Sure he was not going to school, but doing odd jobs on cars. One of his friends came by. He had two guns in his holsters. I said, ""Two gun man."" He pulled them out and shot at a target with the toy pistols."
"0801"	"(03/14/63)"	"I met Margie S., a friend from work. I loved her and she loved me. I was hugging and kissing her. She was now fat. We met again and we were in bed. We were loving up. I covered us under the bed covers and I started to intimate her. She had a baby and came to our house by Grandma's. My mother, sister and brother Steve were there. I called them in from the front room and introduced Margie as my friend. I was further away now and Margie was changing her baby. As she was bending over, I said I could see her boobies because her dress fell away from her bosom. Judy and Margie's babies were playing and Judy fell over hers and got hurt. There were lions outside and they were running wild. One was coming at me. I ran and made a jump up on the perch on one side of the building and perched there. The lions could jump that high, but I was prepared with something I had that I could knock them away as they came at me thru the air. A couple tried it, but didn't jump at me."
"0802"	"(03/14/63)"	"I was watching people going to show. I was with a movie actor. We were in flight from a gang. We got away and then they caught up with us. We were in a building and we finally eluded them. We locked the gate to keep them in, then another gate and the third one was hard to shut tight, so I could put a padlock on. I said, ""Let's get in our getaway car and go,"" but he wanted to lock the last gate or door and our pursuers got out and caught him. I got into the car and got away, but two of the boys were on the running board with me. I was going to get rid of them by giving them a close call by driving close to a tree or post and then all of them to get off or I would knock them off on the next tree. They caught up with me next and I was their prisoner. They told me to drive to our home town and I could go home. I was sitting on a  big truck top. John Delatt and Carter were in the cab. Carter was driving and the truck got away from him. I got off and Delatt chased the truck which was running away. I saw Flight as a winner."
"0803"	"(03/16/63)"	"I saw Half Doll a winner and I had it. I was at the car barns. I drove a streetcar. It was like drive it yourself. I saw Blessing $920."
"0804"	"(03/17/63)"	"I saw Rocketry."
"0805"	"(03/18/63)"	"I was driving my car and the lights were blinking off and on."
"0806"	"(03/18/63)"	"I was coasting down the hill on Main Street. Judy came down on a sled all by herself. I went down to White's to buy a sewing machine. I met Red or Ray Yankar. He was a guard at White's."
"0807"	"(03/18/63)"	"I was going to marry a small woman. She was about 4 ft. high. I thought of it. The more I didn't like to marry such a short girl."
"0808"	"(03/19/63)"	"I saw a Mary pp 4 a winner. I can't recall the other name and the mutuls. We were hiding or playing in bushes in the country of in someone's back yard. We were in a building and there were Chinese and Japanese outside of the building. We were going to try to get away from there."
"0809"	"(03/19/63)"	"I was dreaming of spooks or something. I seemed to hear one go into Judy's room. I ran in there and I didn't see any one of them."
"0810"	"(03/20/63)"	"I was driving and a tiger was on the street following me. I was with Ann. We had a convertible. The top down. The tiger was playful. He jumped over the car just a few feet over our heads. We couldn't shake him off. Then I stopped and the tiger was with us. I was going to try to knock him out. He looked if I pointed a direction, so I pointed to the ground. He  looked and I picked up a hammer and started to hit him on the head. He was groggy and I kept hitting him, that kept him down."
"0811"	"(03/21/63)"	"I was hunting. I shot a small pheasant and could not find it. I was looking at some boats on a lake. We were going to borrow one for a while, which we did. Then we got on a truck, the back end of it, and it started off fast. I just got hold of a bar and had a hard time to get my other hand on the bar from the speed he was going. I was in Rivertown, my boyhood town. We were going to a funeral. I saw Mitzie Evans at the funeral."
"0812"	"(03/21/63)"	"I set up a job and ran it on the 2nd shift. When I came in in the morning, I had to have it inspected. I tried one of the gauges and it went thru it instead of flush. I noticed the collet was rubbing on the square side of the square stock."
"0813"	"(03/22/63)"	"I was holding my penis in my hand and to my surprise it was about 12 inches long. I was razzing or treating one of my servants mean. He finally got so fed up that he turned on me. He had Judy in his arms and he had my sharp butcher knife in one hand and was coming at me with it. I pleaded and begged him not to harm me, then he looked at Judy and pointed the knife at her, and I pleaded to him not to harm her. I noticed the knife had a couple big notches in the sharp blade."
"0814"	"(03/23/63)"	"I was driving my car and I had trouble with it."
"0815"	"(03/24/63)"	"I was pushing my brother Mike's car. I gave him a good start and then it was so dark, I could not see. I saw a pair of headlights and that's all. Then I gave him another start and he started and my car stalled. I looked up and the traffic light was green and I was trying to start my car. It finally did and I drove off to get away from the traffic because I couldn't see from the darkness. I was over to see someone I knew. I liked their home and would like to live there because I liked the location. Then I was supposed to be rich. I was so happy, it seemed such a happy and new life."
"0816"	"(03/25/63)"	"There seemed to be a lot of flood water around. We came to a town and the water was flooding the town. Water was running thru the streets and homes. I looked at some homes and the water was above the first floor. Mary Lasko was with us as we walked around. She jumped into a deep waterhole and as she did, she was yelling for help. I ran down close to the hole, but I couldn't reach her from there. Tom Lasko took a dive in and brought her up. I helped him to pull her out of the water. We put her head down and drained the water out of her. Then we gave her artificial respiration. She finally started to breathe. We saved her life. Tom said, ""This is the 4th or 5th time her life was saved."" Mary didn't like this. She walked away and there was a man who drove or rode a bicycle into the water and yelled for help again and the men around rescued him. I looked into the farm and I saw Ascot."
"0817"	"(03/26/63)"	"I had my work on trays and the track names were on the tray bottoms like Aqua, oak, lin, etc. Audrey was checking or inspecting the work or gauging it. There was a strip by the company store in Rivertown where the autos were speeding. I noticed the cars and there was a policeman and didn't bother no one for speeding. So I drove thru the strip at high speed about three times. I really did gun it good. Some young lady was kissing young fellows. I happened to be there and she came up to me and kissed me, to my surprise. I was flattered. Audrey said, ""Did the reason she did that was she knows you have money?"""
"0818"	"(03/27/63)"	"I was parking my car in Dill's parking lot and I parked last one in a row by the park side. We had two young girls come to our home and just lounged around. One of them called me when I was going out. I came back and she was lying on the bed and her dress was up. I could see her beautiful legs and vagina. She did this on purpose. Later two men came in. I thought to myself, ""What is this, a meeting place for the girls and boys? I will have to put a stop to this."" I was flying along the ground three feet above the ground."
"0819"	"(03/27/63)"	"I heard someone call, ""John Evans, you are next in for this bargain."" Marie Lasko was baking cakes and bakery. I said alright, so I took a few cakes. I saw just plain John. I looked at it twice and that all there was. We were standing around Auto in the tool room listening to a speaker over the PA or radio. Then we went to the locker room to change clothes. I was dragging or pulling a coke over scraper to the coke yard to drown one over of coke. There was snow on the ground and we had to shovel it. I got a wide shovel to do it. A lady asked me for a safety pin so I gave her two and she put them on a string of them. She was saving them. I gave Ann a bunch of tools pliers and my wrist watch for a present. "
"0820"	"(03/28/63)"	"I was walking by #E105 St. by a nice girl. She was watching the men go by and commented of their physical looks. When I went by, she said, ""Wow, there's a slim, tall, handsome fellow. I have a husband like that."" This flattered me. There was a big tree and a squirrel was up there. Then somehow I was in the tree and coming down imitating the squirrel. A man was down on the ground and was going to show how he could throw the squirrel or me over his shoulder. He got hold of me and swung me down as he did, so he had a third leg in the center of his body. I got hold of the center leg and he couldn't throw me over his shoulder. He had three legs. He was a freak. I was in our garden in Rivertown and went to the back gate which was a block of concrete like a block of sidewalk. As I got near it, it came down on me and was under it in the snow and got excited if I could breathe. I could, but I couldn't lift the stone and get out."
"0821"	"(03/29/63)"	"We drove into a driveway of a farm. Then we went bowling. I had a bundle of money and my friend was a very good counter of bills. He could count less or more bills as you watched him do it. I got a paper with the entries. It had the selections which were picked by selectors which were named by an initial like K A and etc. Then I found another paper which also had the selections by different selectors. I sat by the table and on the other side we had a bright spotlight shining on it, so I went there and sat in the light and was going to compare the selections and check the horses that were picked by most of the selectors."
"0822"	"(03/29/63)"	"I was in the country. I looked into a hole in the ground and way down in the hold I could see like squirrels moving around. They were coming up out of the hole and finally came out and, to my surprise, they were chekeetas, a male, female and a cub. They were in a cage and to my surprise Bob was in there with him. I said, ""Bob, get out of there. They will kill you."" And he said, ""They are harmless."" He stamped his foot and they jumped back. He opened the gate of the cage and came out. Then later the chekeeta was my pet. I went into the woods with it and he found a grape vine with ripe grapes and we ate them. He made a grinding noise when he ate the grapes. I looked into the sky and I just can't recall now what we were looking at, but it was at something unusual."
"0823"	"(03/30/63)"	"I was behind the schoolhouse of my boyhood days. Louie Pretiel was knocking out flies and he actually knocked some in back of himself as though someone was pitching to him, but they were not fouled out, but hit squire by the bat and circled back to the back of him. I watched the ball go and I picked it up. It was a little out of round."
"0824"	"(03/31/63)"	"We were traveling on a highway and the road was bad. There was snow and mud and I was going up a hill and I thought I wouldn't make it, but I did. I was away from home about three weeks and was lonesome for my family. I was operating three machines. I was making some kind of small gears. I gauged the jobs and had to put each individual piece in the machine for the operation."
"0825"	"(04/01/63)"	"We were looking down on some cartoons or comics of people doing different things. They were moving objects, like the last one was men singing. They came by with their mouth open, about three of them, and the last one had his mouth wide open about the size of a bowling ball. We were driving by the suburbs and at the end of the streets we saw big terraces or apartments. We saw some homes built up on stilts, four posts about 20 ft. off the ground and there were shady roofs with floors built away from the apartments for the tenants. They were built on big tree trunks about 5 ft. off the ground. I was flying around with some other fellows. Two of them were chasing one another. One had a gun and was trying to get a bead on the other one as they flew in a circle. Paul, the guard or watchman at Dill's, was selling something, as usual. We were working to 6 am that day."
"0826"	"(04/01/63)"	"I was swimming in a stream that was in the street and there were small dogs in it coming at me. I splashed water on them. The dogs were so small, I picked one up in my hand. Down the stream further a larger dog came after me and wanted me to play with him. He spoke to me to do so, so I played with him as though he was biting me and I was getting away from him. I sent a letter to a company complaining I got a wrong fit on a piece of wood when I mailed it. It dawned on me I had the wood backwards when I tried to fit the two pieces. So I received an answer and they said I was holding the wood backwards."
"0827"	"(04/02/63)"	"I was putting gold money in the bank. I had a lot of money in the bank. They were gold certificates. I was operating a machine. I ground one bar about three times and still I didn't get its point ground all around. It still had a corner not ground round."
"0828"	"(04/02/63)"	"I was watching boys getting ready to play a night game of baseball. The light shined into the catcher's eyes and he threw the ball wild to3rd base. I walked away and was walking by trains or locomotives on a side track. There was a freight train and it had the shape of a train a stack on it the whole shape of a train. I had to walk between two trains that were parking on a side track. I saw big doughnuts that a lady was baking. A fellow was carrying a bag of papers and his hat fell off. I picked it up and I noticed another hat was on the ground. A fellow just walked by before, so I yelled to him if it was his, but he had a hat on. I seemed to have received a lot of money from someone. I was moving one of the chip trucks at White's and I knocked over a radio cabinet. It fell against a bench."
"0829"	"(04/03/63)"	"I met a movie producer and he took a liking to me, so I kind of hung around him. When he was giving a fellow a tryout, I was watching him. He didn't like how the man expressed himself as an actor. So he dropped him. He was looking for another man and I was giving it a serious thought of becoming a show man or actor. I could act. I would feel as though I was in real life, what I would say or do. One day we were talking with the producer and he said, ""I think you would be a good actor. I have been watching you."" I didn't say yes, but was acting a little shy. The producer said, ""You can take a tryout and there is no harm in that,"" so I agreed. I don't remember the tryout, but I was a success and I was now in a show business and an actor. On one occasion I met Bill Kruse, a fellow worker, and he was an actor also. I had a sort of whip or switch and so did Bill. I challenged him and I heard someone say to me, ""You better not take him on for you will be fighting five guys."" I went ahead and I lashed at him, and then I poked him in one eye. I kept on poking him in one eye and he was helpless. Later I told this to my producer friend and it amused him and he liked it. Ann was with me on my work lot. This play would last about seven years, said my producer friend. I was happy with this work."
"0830"	"(04/03/63)"	"I was downstairs by Grandma's and all at once water started to drip thru the ceiling in two rooms. I went upstairs and the water was running over the sink and on the floor. I told my mother why she didn't shut the water off and she said she didn't know the water was running. Later I went outside with Ann and my sister Sue came over. She had a cowgirl outfit on and a banjo. I went into the house and Ann stayed outside with Sue. I heard her play on the banjo."
"0831"	"(04/04/63)"	"I saw or was saying Butterfly as winner. Cecilia Lippert was getting married and there was married."
"0832"	"(04/04/63)"	"I was watching a prehistoric monster on a street. He was like an elephant, only about four times as big. He was standing and a woman came down the street and didn't see him. When she got close, he started to move silently towards her, but she accidentally walked into a store, so he went into a store about four doors back and started to go thru doors towards the woman and he was not a monster now because he went thru regular doors. I saw Bill Grove and other people walk down the street where the monster would come out, but to my surprise I thought the monster was coming towards us and now it was a giant elephant instead and more to my surprise, he was just a big image balloon that men were carrying along. I saw 6-8 and 7-5 or was repeating it or someone told me. I'm not quite sure."
"0833"	"(04/05/63)"	"I was looking for Margie S. in New York City. She lived off one of he side streets and had to go thru a store to her rooms. I met her and she took me to her rooms and laughed that I would not be able to find her place. When I came out, I looked at the children playing in the street. There were tall buildings all around and I thought what a life these kids had in the stuffy city, bad air and no place to play."
"0834"	"(04/06/63)"	"I was working in a shop and it was overtime because I had over 8 hours work in already. I passed a fellow worker who was reclining and said, ""Come on and take a rest. I am."" But I walked by. I was cleaning out brass chips out of the bottom of some big machinery. This was already cleaner and I was supposed to put the finishing touches to it, but I found out that the bottom was deep and a lot of chips were still on the bottom. I found the boss, so I told him and he was going to send some help."
"0835"	"(04/06/63)"	"I was working again. A fellow worker was walking by with a sheet and had some results written on it. I glanced quick as he walked by. The names seemed like this is that, etc., sort of rhyme horses. I heard a fellow say the cops shot at two men who grabbed a scratch sheet and ran. I saw cops made of men from the shop men. They had fancy new clothes. I sort of joked with them as I walked by."
"0836"	"(04/07/63)"	"I saw Henry Seegert. He had quite a beard about 1 week's growth. He was jolly and talking to someone. I drove down to Carl Fisher's house to go to work with him. When I got there, he was still sleeping. I said, ""What time is it?"" and Mrs. Fisher didn't know. I asked to use her phone and to my surprise there was no numbers or letters on her phone dial. It was loose, kind of stuck with glue. A lady came out of the front room and then another one. They didn't say anything, but one of them came up to me and kissed me and I did so in return. She surprised me. Then Carl got up came into the kitchen in his sorts. I was surprised how big he was and how husky his hips and legs were. I didn't know he was so husky. I drove and there was snow on the streets. We were by our garage and I saw a big bug flying towards me. I had a fly swatter so I swung it in his direction. He flew up on the electric wires. I got a stick and tossed it up at him as it came close to him he got hold of the stick, sat on it and came down with it. He was a very big bug. I started to hit him with the fly swatter. He was very touch. He turned towards me to fight. He had a hard, crusty body and a big mouth. As I was hitting him, small bugs seemed to come off him and they were crawling towards me, so I swatted them. Then the big grub and the small ones stopped crawling and were dead. I looked at them and said, ""How did this bug fly around when it is so cold and snow on the ground?"""
"0837"	"(04/08/63)"	"I was in the field of GTHS and their football field was like plowed up and it was night. The bus had the headlights turned on it to light it up for the players. I was operating my B and S machines in the shop. I had trouble with the brass and the machines."
"0838"	"(04/09/63)"	"I was cleaning out the stairway on 68th St. for the scrap men coming."
"0839"	"(04/09/63)"	"I was looking in the paper and I saw in the selections The Dragon in large print. I saw others, but can't recall them now. My dad (deceased) now was staying with us for a while. I thought of him and also thought he could stay on and not go live by himself. He would have to pay his board and his heating bill."
"0840"	"(04/10/63)"	"Some big man punched Judy in the face. I was surprised he didn't knock her out or kill her, but he didn't. I ran after him, chasing him and at the same time throwing rocks and everything I got hold of. He climbed up on a small bank and lay there hiding. I was throwing at him and didn't seem to be able to hit him. Then he got up and came down and I was chasing him again and throwing at him. I heard or said ""ancient."" I parked my car on a steep grade, put on my brake and put the car in gear and the car rolled back down the grade. I couldn't hold it with the foot brake. I went on top of Swaney Lenarcic's house to fix the roof where there was a leak. I had two bolts running thru and the nuts were outside. I held the nut and Ann turned the bolt. I yelled down at her. She was turning the bolt the wrong way. I knocked on the roof to get her attention and then she turned it the right way. The roof was very dangerous. It seemed to give when it was walked on. There was a roofer laying a new tarpaper on the roof. Jack Lasko and another guy got into an argument. The other guy was a tall man. He said, ""I will knock your block off"". So they started to fight. Jack was jabbing him on the nose. The he gave the big guy a right on the nose and the big guy went down and the blood ran out of his nose. He got up and I thought he was going to fight more, but he said he had enough, so the fight was over. I saw snakes somehow. I can't recall now. When I parked my car, I was going to make a payment of some kind in the building."
"0841"	"(04/11/63)"	"I was driving around. I was loading coal into my truck."
"0842"	"(04/12/63)"	"I was in bed with Ann. We were going to do some loving, but my dad was there. I was in bed again and some rowdy kids came around and I knew what they were up to, so I got hold of them and put them out of bed. I picked up a baby and also threw it out of bed. One of them went out and I knew what he was up to, so I got up and out I went into the big city. I was going under the elevator and I knew the gangsters were there and tried to do away with as I walked under the elevator. They made it come down on me. I was under it on the bottom, but it didn't crush me. They had me under there and were going to finish me off, but I yelled from under there for the people out on the street to make the elevator go up. I was under it. Someone raised it up a little and I knew they wanted me to start crawling out, then they would let it down on me. I put some bricks under the elevator to brace it up and I then crawled out and I was in flight from this gang in a big city. I flew away to another part of the city, but they found me and I was in flight again. This time I ran and ran to get away. I knew they would find me because as I crossed the streets, I thought they were lurking there. I ran across a park. There were kids playing ball. Then it rained and I kept up running in flight. I came to a tree and man with a basket came by me and said can I look into a bird nest, which was on a low branch. He wanted to take or rob the nest. I said no, but some friend of mine said let him do it."
"0843"	"(04/13/63)"	"Judy was trying on Ed, the coal miner's cap and it was so big she wrapped it twice around her head. He was leaving it for someone to come and try it on. There were headlights on a bridge. It was night when the lights hit the bridge from an approaching car. The headlights on the bridge would go on. I was looking at entries or something like that or results. I saw fire with a circle around it like I have. There were other horses circled or marked like that, but I can't recall them now."
"0844"	"(04/13/63)"	"I saw Wheel Guard. I was repairing or doing some kind of stem work. I was cutting them in two or halves and then shaving off the burrs left inside of the hole. I saw 0 6. I heard 15 and 15 that's who it is, 15. I had 16 horses written on a piece of paper and I wanted to know which horse would win. I was working on my machines in Dill's. I went over and operated another machine on a different line and there were small screws on the bench. I cleaned them off. I cleaned out the brass chips out of the machines. I saw Harold Hilts standing it he department waiting for starting time. He looked much younger and better. Bob came over to me. He was to work by Hill's. He said, ""I will work here till Nick calls me, then I will work for Nick."""
"0845"	"(04/13/63)"	"Marty was making an impression. Nick's marking the bench and said someone told him to watch Hangman. I said play $1 on him. We were walking in the country and there were a lot of creatures like snakes. They had their tails sticking out of holes in the banks about a foot and a half and they were wiggling or waving them. I saw a crab going into his hold in the bank. I told Audrey to be careful. She was monkeying around with the snake tails."
"0846"	"(04/14/63)"	"There was post office work in Dill's and Ann was working there. They were going to build a building for the post office. We were looking at the plowed field that was the site for the building. Mr. Duke was in some organization. It was like about sex relations. My wife was also a member and they had her read for them because she was such a good reader. I was flying. I could fly so gracefully I would work my arms like wings and flew in Rivertown. I seemed to hear 6-6-6 repeated three times."
"0847"	"(04/16/63)"	"I was in the country. I was going to cross a field, but there was a bull in it. When I got near the fence, the bull pushed the lose fence wire and got my close to me. I moved further back and he pushed the fence more and I had to move more. Then later on the other side of the field the bull did the very same thing as before. He seemed to be jammed against the fence."
"0848"	"(04/17/63)"	"I was in the basement. I was sexually hot. My sister Ann came down and I hid behind and wall and called her over. When she came over, I surprised her. I asked her for intercourse and she said no, not too meanly. I put my arms around her and picked up her dress and I intimated her standing up."
"0849"	"(04/17/63)"	"I saw or said Tigeress and Big."
"0850"	"(04/17/63)"	"I was walking in the country in Rivertown. I came to Moser's farm. I flew over the yard and landed on a high perch. Then I was puzzled if I should jump. I knew I could fly. I went to a lower side and jumped, then I flew over the road. I was outside and only had my undershirt on."
"0851"	"(04/18/63)"	"I wanted to know if Wheel Guard was going to win and in my sleep I asked a person I don't know if Wheel Guard would win today and he said no."
"0852"	"(04/18/63)"	"We were in our basement looking for mice and couldn't find any. Then I said, ""We won't find any mice here because there are no mice here because the foundation is solid and they can't get inside."""
"0853"	"(04/19/63)"	"I was with Charley Charvat at work on a couple of occasions He was complaining of the low rate he was receiving."
"0854"	"(04/21/63)"	"We were in radiation, atomic bombs were dropped and we were helping people who were injured. We were washing the dishes from radiation. I was checking or marking the horses that won and there were about 20 of them. I can't recall any of them clearly now. We were in our house in Rivertown and Judy was walking thru the living room and she walked thru the front door and it was dark. I looked to see if she was safe. I called her into the house and she came in."
"0855"	"(04/21/63)"	"I had my shoes off, barefooted, and a lady had her bare feet. I had a beautiful shaped foot like the lady. My toes were shaped nice except on the left foot big toe it was bent in from the shoe that caused it. I was sitting and looking and admiring my feet. There was a gang of boys that had pistols. They were going thru the woods and the cops were looking for them. The boys were shooting at each other. I flew up and out of the way of the shooting."
"0856"	"(04/21/63)"	"I was looking at the entries and results, but I can't recall the names. I went out to buy form and there was only 2 sheets of paper instead of about 20 or 30 sheets. Out of the plain dealer he drew out a cloth bag as part of the plain dealer. There were two lines going into Kenny Kings."
"0857"	"(04/22/63)"	"We were in Russia. A young fellow came there and the Russian Boxing champ was Wallace Berry, our former movie star (deceased). They wanted this fellow to fight Berry, but he heard about six assistants helping him. They would hold him and Wallace would punch him. They finally knocked this fellow down into the water and he was groggy, so Berry challenged him himself. I looked at Berry and he was a big fat bully, very fat. When the man walked out of the water, Wallace punched him and knocked him back into the water. We were looking thru unbreakable glass. The American came near the glass and punched it, breaking it. I could see the cracks in it. Ann and I went into a restaurant. She sat down and I went to see what menu they had. I couldn't see anything, so I asked a waitress what they had. She pointed at the menu signs hanging on some string. One was hanging sideways, so I had to twist my head. I came against the young waitress's breast so I put my head on her bosom and I looked at the menu. It was a Chesapeake steak. My dad was getting a job for himself. He was hired and it was a very hard job at the Chevrolet plant."
"0858"	"(04/23/63)"	"I was in PA in Rivertown. My dad had a high power rifle. I took an aim or pointed the rifle at a squirrel about 40 ft. away, but he was in line with some homes further away and I didn't shoot because I would hit one of the homes. We had a party or were at a party by Frank Lasko's. I brought some meat. I cut it with a very sharp knife. We stopped by Harold Hilts. He had a shop going. He had some sort of liquor. He told me to pour it into a jar, which I did. Then he told me to wire it, which I did. It foamed. Then we were putting some kind of cloth to cover the top. I was watching somebody uncover a drum and they were taking out coin money out of it. Then they covered it again. I looked thru a telescope at a straw and when I saw it, it was a small man."
"0859"	"(04/24/63)"	"I was riding with Pauline Lenarcic. She was driving the car and drove very slow. I told her my Plymouth rode like that when it was carboned up. I was trying to find a place for Judy to sleep while we're at a party. I went to two hotels and neither one of them would tell me what the charge would be. One of them filled out the papers and the lady said, ""You sign here."" I said, ""I will not sign unless you tell me what the bill will be."" We were at a party."
"0860"	"(04/25/63)"	"I was with Margie S. She was wanted for some crime by police. I went after her thru a trap door into the attic. To my surprise she was invisible because Mr. Lasko (deceased) came up and a dog also came up and neither of them could see her or me. The two police came up, looked around, walked by us and didn't see us. Marty gave me a daily double. He showed me different doubles that won and one that seemed to stick with me was 56. I saw 75 and lot of others that won before. I looked into a movie in Rivertown. It was 10 cents and the movie was an all-night movie."
"0861"	"(04/26/63)"	"I saw Tel or Tol $157. We were watching movies of how hunters get killed hunting big game. We saw a man wound a big doe deer. The doe charged, the man ran. Then we saw the doe. Its head was blood-smeared from killing the hunter. We saw that on three occasions and the deer always faced Judy on the front of the seats. I told her to come back with me. I was afraid the deer would charge her."
"0862"	"(04/26/63)"	"I was working on a wooden scaffold. I looked down and it looked like about 150 ft. high. I said I wouldn't want to fall off. Just about a minute after some of the sides broke loose and I fell off and to my surprise I didn't get hurt."
"0863"	"(04/26/63)"	"Joyce and Delatt were loving up. She started to tease him and he chased her. He caught her and squeezed her and said, ""I will stick this thing into you."" She said, ""Go ahead, so I can get pregnant and we can get married. I want it bad and you are stalling."" We were looking into a lake bottom watching the fish swim. Then a dg like which had six legs came stumbling along on the bottom. Someone threw a piece of meat and the dog ate it. He looked so awkward with his six legs."
"0864"	"(04/27/63)"	"When I awoke, I heard (I know what you gave her, a full house). I was working at Dill's. I had my shoes off and my feet were dirty. I was in the basement. I made a meal in a dirty can and it didn't taste very good, so I was going upstairs to cook it in a kettle. I was dreaming of people turning a funny color and dying."
"0865"	"(04/27/63)"	"I looked at the results in the first and second races and I remember Well Spring as winner in the second race."
"0866"	"(04/28/63)"	"I was lacing my shoes and my shoestrings were about 2 feet too long. I was trying to fix a broken electric wire on a post outside because I was afraid the kids would get shocked or electrocuted by playing with the wire. I touched the two wires and the electric was not on. I saw Boyage picked 1st in the selections."
"0867"	"(04/28/63)"	"I started my car and it was night (dark). I pulled on the switch and the rod broke off. I had to reach underneath to get hold of the rod and put on the lights."
"0868"	"(04/29/63)"	"We were on the coke yard in Rivertown and there were lions, place of my boyhood days. We started to fly, then we were in a big building and the lions were trying to get us and they finally got up around the top or ceiling of the big building. Then the lions were men. I got outside and Carter was after me. I flew in flight. He caught me. I was small and he was very big and tall. He set me down on the ground and he was playing with a ball. I had a chance to get away from him, so I took off and flew up out of his reach. I was flying so much that I started to tire and he caught me again and was going to eat me. He took me into his house and I was just waiting for him to eat me. Then Steve Kokash came in and wanted to know if Carter could take off some kind of contraption off him, which was wound around him."
"0869"	"(04/29/63)"	"Bob and I were hunting. I shot at a rabbit and Bob shot at him when he was quite far. When he shot, the rabbit started to run and jump. His jumps were about 15 ft. high and he kept on running and jumping that high. I was going to put on my light on the car and the rod broke again. Bob and I worked on it. Finally he fixed it and pulled it again to put on the lights and it was broken again. I went to get a stovepipe and the man gave me one with a grating on it. I said this pipe is no good because the smoke and fumes will come out into the house. He looked at it and agreed, then he bawled his helper for giving me it."
"0870"	"(04/29/63)"	"I saw smoke coming out of a door and out of a chimney from our shanty. I went in and Mike Brown was putting some coal in a small potbelly stove. I said, ""There is enough coal in the stove. It is not cold."" He went out and I put a couple lumps of coal into the stove. Then I looked up at the pipes and they were disconnected. That's what caused the smoke to come into the shed. I was putting the pipes together. I stretched one of the wires holding the pipes and it broke. There were a lot of safety pins fastened together to hold the pipes, so I coupled them and fixed the pipes. I drove my car in the dark. The lights were out and I could see I was steering over the curb on the sidewalk. I was afraid I would hit a lamppost, so I stopped the car."
"0871"	"(04/30/63)"	"I was in Rivertown. I visited the Minkus family. I met Zeanie, his mother and a granddaughter. Zeanie couldn't recognize me. I told him what house I lived in and I finally told him who I was. I said, ""It's a long time since I left here 38 years ago."" I talked with the granddaughter and to my surprise there were new brick homes built where the old homes were wrecked for the strip mining. I looked in surprise at the homes and thought where do the people work. Then I told them about Judy, but the way I told it, I was her brother and my mother had her. I said how beautiful and smart she is and the granddaughter said, ""It's only in your head,"" and she touched my forehead with her finger. I asked Zeanie where the Knetzer's went, and he said to Houston, Texas."
"0872"	"(04/30/63)"	"I was in a parking lot. It seemed to be muddy. I saw one car partly over the embankment. I drove across the lot and my wheels skidded a little, but I kept on going and I got off the lot."
"0873"	"(04/30/63)"	"I was driving thru the downtown. There were people sitting on the street. I couldn't stop because I was sliding, so I had to go between them. I was downtown. I looked at the spot where the square is and they had some old buildings torn down and were going to build new ones. Then I walked thru a street where there was no traffic. The street had debris on it and it was not used for traffic. I could see the use of traffic was going on the outside of the city. I walked and came to an embankment. I had to go over a couple of fences and over some rocks till I got on a level street again."
"0874"	"(04/30/63)"	"Ann and I were in a building. I walked to a doctor's office and I said, ""Why do I have to go in here?"" So I walked away and we went to an elevator and the big double door closed. I was with Bob Lippert. He picked up Bob. He was small and carried him. I looked into the shanty and there was snow on Bob's watch he left there."
"0875"	"(05/01/63)"	"I heard Duke won as I was awaking. I saw Seebit as a selection to win. I was finding money on my back seat in the car. I found a lot of dimes as I or someone would sit on the seat. I was always picking up coins. Then the seat was an old bed, old iron bed. I said, ""I'm going to keep it behind the garage."" I was invited by my sister Mary to dust her rugs. She asked me to do it and I said, ""Ok, I'll help you."" There were three friends of mine who traveled by car and got very little sleep. We had a dog. He saw a toad hopping around. He grabbed the toad in his mouth and bit it a couple of times. The toad got bigger then the dog acted like a human being. He put his paws together like a man would put his hands and he coaxed the toad to come to him. He picked it up and hugged the toad."
"0876"	"(05/02/63)"	"I saw Palident and a boy get into a boxcar. They had a pony with them. The pony jumped up into the boxcar and went to the corner where there was food for him. Then Palident threw out a rope and lassoed a pile of his belongings on the ground about 20 feet away and a small pile that belonged to the boy. He then tied the rope to the inside of the boxcar and went on with his work inside. Someone built a shanty on top of a boxcar and on stilts. The freight train started to move and the rope with Palident's belongings went up into the air. It was like a kite. It was sliding on phone wires along the route. I was driving on the highways in my old Plymouth. I had two boys in the back seat and Judy and someone else in the front. We were going to Ascot Park. I stopped on the way and there were some boy hitchhikers. One of them stuck his head thru the open window and looked in. It was Bob. I said, ""Come in, Bob, there is room for you."" He got in and we went on. My Plymouth didn't have no pep at all. Somehow I was to borrow or I borrowed $50 and Al from Dill said he owed me $16 and somebody more."
"0877"	"(05/03/63)"	"I watched a hunter take off with his gun. He flew overhead and made a landing in a hunting field. He soared like Superman."
"0878"	"(05/04/63)"	"I was trying to find out if Bonjour won the Derby because I played him. I heard a voice or someone say, ""Yes, we won. We sure did."" He meant Bonjour. I was walking with Judy on Broadway Ave. I looked ahead and there was a big white bear on the sidewalk about 500 ft. ahead. I walked across a field to the next avenue to go around the bear. I was in a colored neighborhood. I was in a place. I saw some trinkets nailed on a wall, so I got a screwdriver and pried them loose and put them into my pocket. I was afraid I would be caught, but I walked out and no one bothered me. I felt it was wrong to steal that, but I just did it. I went outside and was waiting for a streetcar. Then I asked a colored boy when the cars would come by and he said, ""Go in and ask the nurse."" So I went in expecting all colored people. The nurse's face was plastered black with looked like soot. She said, ""Hello, Mr. Evans."" I was surprised and the face looked familiar. I couldn't place her. Now I'm awake and I know it was Mrs. Rose Ezenski. Judy and I were walking on the sidewalk and there were birds on the sidewalk ahead of us. She wanted to catch them, but when we got close, they flew away."
"0879"	"(05/05/63)"	"I was looking at the race results and I remember swimming in or swimming was a winner. I can't recall the other ones. The paper seemed to be sheet metal or tin. Barbara's children were sleeping one night and day. When I was over, it was evening and the children were still sleeping."
"0880"	"(05/05/63)"	"I was on St. Claire Ave. in Big City. I looked up and a storm was coming. I saw a couple clouds that were black as black paint. I never saw such black clouds. I walked into a room of the shop to look at something that I thought was not functioning right. All at once I heard a shot like a gun. I looked on the floor and there was a safety belt across the aisle to signal anyone who stepped by it to be cautious of dangers. I walked out of there and when I got outside, I saw a colored boy running by with some building material in his hands. Frank Lasko was running after him, so I took after them. It was night. I had a flashlight. I put on the light and its light gave a good glow on the schoolhouse where the boy ran. Later he came back with his dad. He surrendered and was going to bring it back. As we walked back, the street was muddy. I looked at a tree which the leaves and part of the branches were falling off and there was a pile of black leaves about three feet high under the tree."
"0881"	"(05/06/63)"	"There were about 5 men on posts. They were wiring it seemed the names of the horses at Ascot Park. I heard one of the men say, ""If we don't do our job, they may fire us."" Carl Fisher and I were working. We were outside in my car and Malley McPhail was there. He was talking with Carl."
"0882"	"(05/06/63)"	"I bought a name and a number plate from Norm. The dr. from Fairmont Dairy for $5. Then from 732 the comedian a plate also for $3. All this was a violation of a law of some kind. Then later I was accused for buying this by 73 and he was the one that sold me it. He gave me five lashes with a  whip. I met his daughter later and I told her about this. We were prisoners of some kind. I was out of the compound, then I wanted to get back in, but was afraid the fence was wired for an alarm and I would be punished again for being outside of the compound."
"0883"	"(05/08/63)"	"I was watching some kind of old stage play. It was of presidents of the USA. One of the former presidents (deceased) came out and I spoke up, saying something like, ""You look like the picture or image you are."""
"0884"	"(05/09/63)"	"I was trying to keep a big man away with me with a long pole. I was swinging it and I hit him on the side of the head and he staggered and I hit him again and then I let him come up to me staggering. We looked at wooden boxes that I put together. They were loose and wobbly from me hitting the man on the side of the face or head."
"0885"	"(05/10/63)"	"Chester was barefooted tamping down the railroad ties. We were laying down a railroad track. The track was like a steel chain for pulling on a big spindle. I was holding the chain or rail in place while it was fastened to the ties. I was driving and came to a detour. The road was roped off. I drove over some tracks and I saw an engine (train) go by. I was with someone who looked like Ed Mcunis. He was drinking beer out of a bottle and kind of spilled a little on me. I took the bottle and told him to open his mouth and I poured the beer into his mouth. I have a faint inkling someone told me of a big horse winning. I came up to the bed where Ann was sleeping. I awoke her and when she got up, there were hundreds of small bedbugs crawling on the bed. I had a shovel in my hands, so I started to hit the big ones with the shovel. Ann showed me a couple aquariums of fish and she said the bugs fall into the water and the fish eat them. I was riding a small car. I moved it by turning the wheel. Then I saw a small donkey. It was as small as a small dog, about 8 inches high."
"0886"	"(05/11/63)"	"Someone wanted to play Art Voyage. I was going to play it and the party wanted to play it himself, so I said, ""I will let you play it yourself. I am not sure of the Art in front of it, but the voyage I'm sure of."""
"0887"	"(05/11/63)"	"I was in a hospital bed, but not sick, just sleeping there. I had a paper wad. I shot it with my finger and it stuck on the ceiling. Henry at Dill's asked who had his 22 pistol. I saw Dick Shebek. I told him Henry wanted his pistol that he loaned to him some time ago. I saw a nurse give a lady a check. Her picture was on the wall."
"0888"	"(05/12/63)"	"We were by Carter's. We were getting ready to go on a trip. There was a storm outside. I was looking out the window and I saw a big wave on the lake coming over. It looked like a big tidal wave. I thought it was going to come to the house and wash us away. I ran downstairs as I heard the roar of the wave, but I was happier when I found out the wave didn't come to the house. I saw the wave. My sex organ was hard and I was intimating my wife. Later it was hard and to my surprise my wife also had a penis and testicles. Her penis was also hard."
"0889"	"(05/12/63)"	"I was in Rivertown with Carl Fisher and Judy. We were on the street near the schoolhouse. Fisher went into the house and then as he was coming out, we saw a tiger walking toward us. Fisher went back into the house and I walked to the corner for Judy. I didn't see her and then I was in the house and Judy was home in the parlor. I told her to look out the door and if she saw a wild animal, to shut the door. I looked out and it was dark outside. I was flying with Judy in my arms. We were out in the woods. I had a rifle and we were looking for the tiger. A man came to the door. I asked him what he wanted and he said, ""Mrs. Evans."" He said she was outside. I opened the door and I looked out and saw her in bed. She was getting out of bed and there seemed to be someone under the covers. I was going to investigate, but I awoke."
"0890"	"(05/14/63)"	"Packed House came to me as I was about half asleep on awaking."
"0891"	"(05/15/63)"	"We were on the coke yard and there came an airplane and it was an enemy. We were told to duck down. there were bombs dropped and we were attacked. Then we got an order to hide from the radiation. Loddie Fousek was running in the lead. We went around the corner of the ovens. I looked up and saw a radar apparatus in the air. Then we rested on the other side of the coke ovens and got the signal the fallout was over. Then we came back and there were young men who were going to attack the invaders. Ann had about 6 dresses to sell. We passed a house about 500 ft. away from it and I'm not sure if we waved and the girls waved back at us. We signaled or yelled to them if they needed any dresses. They said they would like to see them. Then to our surprise someone had a pile of girl's bloomers in front of our door as a gift or present to us. Then later there were more, but these were for us to wash."
"0892"	"(05/16/63)"	"I was beside the schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was surprised I only had a tee shirt on and was nude below my waistline. I looked at the boys catching ball on the playground behind the school. We walked up the alley on the end house and the people in the house had a big pile of ripe tomatoes on the lawn for sale."
"0893"	"(05/19/63)"	"We were in Carter's basement and he had three heads or three pictures of a man and said, ""If you guess (he mentioned the name of a man whom I didn't know) the picture of the man, you will win $1800."" I looked at them and thought, ""If I guess the right one, I would win $1800 later."" I made a guess and a bar was thrust in the hole of the mouth of one of the men and it fit, so I won. Then Carter tried one of the other pictures and it also fit, so I had a 2 to 1 chance to win. I heard full count. I can't recall clearly, but there was some sort of same name in syllables in the first and second race at Ascot Park."
"0894"	"(05/20/63)"	"Audrey got a job in a colored neighborhood. She called me to pick her up on a certain street. I didn't know just where it was, so I asked her what main street it was and she didn't know which main street it was near. I was thinking of the colored people living in the slums and felt sorry for them."
"0895"	"(05/21/63)"	"I was out with Jim, the BK. We went into the country to camp. He had a shack there. He showed me a trap he had. A hole in the ground. He chases a rabbit. It ran into the hole and came out the other end and into a trap."
"0896"	"(05/21/63)"	"I was at work when I smelled smoke. We were getting ready to go home. I looked into another dept. and I saw smoke coming into the room. Carl Fischer and another fellow ran for the door and I went back to get something."

"0898"	"(05/23/63)"	"I was driving. I was going to stop my car and pick up Frank Zupanic, but my car wouldn't stop. It skidded down to the bottom of the hill. I opened my car and there was a big hunk of ice on the floor. I used a shovel to shovel it out."
"0899"	"(05/25/63)"	"Andy P. and I were going to school. We were students or pupils. Andy was reading a topic in one of the books. The sentence was a long name. It had a lot of words which were together in one long word and it had to be separated and read out of this long worded sentence or phrase. I went by a window and looked in and saw a young lady and boy laying down rugs."
"0900"	"(05/25/63)"	"I bought some raffle tickets. They were $10 tickets and I seemed to have $10 attached to each ticket. The tickets were tearing in the wrong place as I wanted to separate the stubs. J. Weatrak said, ""I see you are getting a bump on your nose like me."" I said, ""That's from the goggles I wear in the shop."" Judy was small. She was barefooted and she was jumping up about eight inches on the floor continuously. We were watching her. Ann started to heat a pan of baloney. I took some out and ate it. Then I noticed ants crawling over the baloney and it was hot. One got out of the pan and landed on the floor. He started to run, them jump about three inches high. I watched him as he did that from getting a hot foot from the pan. That I knew an ant couldn't do. I went thru a stop sign. As I did, I saw a policeman with radar and I heard it click as I went by. I violated a traffic law. I saw a policeman waiting for me, so I slowed down to stop by him."
"0901"	"(05/26/63)"	"I set an alarm clock on a small round table and set the alarm. The clock started to run around on the table. I stopped it and pressed it a little and it started to run backwards. It seemed to have legs and then wheels and it ran round and around the edge of the round table. I saw Lovelakr II won."
"0902"	"(05/29/63)"	"Tals the store I patronize were killing people by giving them shots by the needle, and were using traps to kill them. I saw this done and they tried to kill me, but I was alert and they were out of luck to get me. One of the boys tried to run me down with a bus, but I got away. They finally gave up trying to kill me and they changed their ways and we became friends. They tried to bribe me with money, but I wouldn't bite. My dad was going to watch or baby-sit with Judy and my mother was going to sit with him. I looked at the mileage on someone's car and it was 66,000."
"0903"	"(05/30/63)"	"We were visiting Marty N. He had a party or some gathering at his home. I just can't recall it now. Someone said the eighth and ninth races were won by the favorites, the last or 9th by Broken Step. He was one of the favorites of the ninth race."
"0904"	"(05/31/63)"	"There was a registering TV that moved by itself from block to block and street to street, which was taking pictures of all who registered to. It was to go to eternity or Russia. I'm not sure or clear on this. It was not compulsory for everyone to register."
"0905"	"(05/31/63)"	"We were standing on a street and the water from a rainstorm was running down the street. The street was full of water. I looked way down and one side of the street the water was running over the sidewalks. We went down there and to our surprise the water seemed to stop and we looked to see where the water went and there seemed to be nowhere it went into, a sewer or nothing. It just stopped there and beyond it the pavement was dry. We were leaning on one of the old buildings by White's and the building was vibrating or shaking. I looked up and I noticed one of the slabs on the top move a little, so I said, ""Let's move away, one of those slabs might fall down on us."" I looked and there was a new railroad built thru the valley down White's. A new double track went down to the river and up the hill to West 25th St. We were looking into some pond. I could see some fish swimming around. I saw some weeds in the water. I pressed it with a broom and fish swam away from the weed. I pulled it up and there were some dead fish. I squeezed in the bush. I saw a woman riding some kind of cart. She was wearing a ribbon in her hair. I said, ""That's a man,"" and she heard me say this. So she stopped and said, ""That's a man."""
"0906"	"(06/01/63)"	"I was intimating some women that were lying prostrate for the purpose. We were waylaid by some rowdies who were going to rob us. Ed Mcunis was the leader. When he saw us, he cut the rope that bound us and freed us."
"0907"	"(06/01/63)"	"I saw Mike Pavlic (deceased about 6 months)."

"0911"	"(06/03/63)"	"I was outside and Frank from Dill's said the best horse in the country or world now was by the name of State. He was not sure of the other part of the name or knew it. I was sitting in a car with a fellow. I looked at the entries, but it was dark and I couldn't see them. I went into the house and Andy P. was there. He was getting ready to go to work. I looked at the clock and it was 15 to 7 am. I said, ""You will be late. You can't make it."" He said, ""I know it."" I was walking along and a nice young hillbilly girl smiled at me and asked me if I would walk with her. I said, ""That would be a pleasure."" So I walked with her. She seemed to be afraid of someone. She stopped in a store and bought a soft drink. I waited for her. A little girl came up to me and said, ""Now you can scram."" I said, ""Now that is not very nice to say. I didn't ask the girl for a walk. She asked me."" There was something of smiles. I saw it on other people or I was doing it. I'm not clear on it now."
"0912"	"(06/03/63)"	"I heard an announcement on radio Daily Double 5Ñ6. I was looking at a clock and it would stop and then go again and then later I saw a brush stuck up there and the clock had the wrong time. I was under some trees. They started to fall. I was dodging them as they fell down."
"0913"	"(06/04/63)"	"I came in to work and two screws broke on the dogs on one of my machines. John Serino, the boss, was actually joking and kidding with me. I was outside and looked at the sun and it was so misty that we could only see the sun and there was no glow or shine from it. I was in Rivertown and the street was covered with snow. We had piles of snow piled up. John Viatrak was up in a tree and two fellows were throwing snowballs at him. I was repeating Lincoln and someone said something about Lincoln."
"0914"	"(06/05/63)"	"I was chasing two boys who Bob went along with. They ran thru a field and I ran after them. I jumped over one fence and then another one. There was tall weed or grass. I looked for them in it. I finally found one of them and he told me where the others were. So we all went back and made an agreement and settled the trouble. Later I saw Harold Hilts. He had about five or six diamond rings. He put out his hand and had them on his fingers. I was with Audrey. I looked down and saw a quarter and a nickel. She saw it the same time. I was going to pick up the quarter, but I let Audrey take it and I picked up the nickel. We walked on and I saw a nickel in a hole. I picked it up and looked into a smaller hole and I saw what looked like a quarter. I took a close look and it was a bottle cap. As I was getting up, two of the boys I made an agreement with came upon me and accused me of taking something out of a pan. I saw when I looked at the bottle cap but I didn't bother it. I saw now hurry and look into your hidden item and see if I touched it. We came upon two hunters. A duck took off across the field running in flight. The hunter took aim, but didn't shoot. He thought it was a pheasant. Then there was a flock of ducks or pheasants in flight overhead. He shot at them, but missed. Then I saw a big duck flying by. He didn't shoot at it. Then to our surprise we saw a green tentacle. It was very big. He shot it and missed. He shot, then I held his gun at a hand it held out and missed. Then we saw the monster face. It was big and red. He was taller than the trees and was moving our way. Then there was a mist like in front of him and he couldn't see us. We started to run. We ran fast and then downhill and finally got away from him."
"0915"	"(06/05/63)"	"Ann and I went to Loddie Fousek's home. I was surprised Ann was behind a screen. He was washing off her bottom with a rag and cloth. Then she was thru, she came out and was putting on her clothes in front of him. She had a big brown spot around her rectum about six inches in diameter. She said it was sore. I said, ""You will have to soak it in water."" Then I looked at her face and it started to turn blue, a real sky blue. Later I looked at her face and it was all blue. Then it started to fade and I said it would go away and her face would be normal. I was downtown walking, some fellow put out his hand and I shook hands with him. I walked further and met my brother Steve. I said, ""Let's go to the car barns. I will give you a ride home in a streetcar."" There were two streetcars going by and I said, ""See, they don't make as much noise as a bus does."" I had on a motorman's hat and a fellow said, ""You are lucky you have a job."""
"0916"	"(06/06/63)"	"I saw the horses walking around. I saw the 2nd horse and I said, ""I think he will win."" His number was 51. I went by the ticket window and I gave him a stub, check, or ticket and asked him if it was good. He said, ""Yes, if someone endorses it. Your daughter, son or friend."" I gave it to Carter and he was endorsing it. Then we went to one of the turns and there was a gate. It was closed and straight, there were posts like on a dead end road. I met Vance and his girlfriend. He introduced me to her. When she took my hand, she gave it a hard squeeze. There was a small tree on a wall by Carter. I pulled it out and off."
"0917"	"(06/06/63)"	"I was in the flats working on the old B and S. I knew it was a dream. I saw Hank Seegert and Louie Kaufman, our foreman. He came over to look at machine 26. It was so clear to me. I knew Louie was dead and this was a dream. I saw Hank come to the machines, so I walked up to him and asked him what the daily double would be today and he turned away from me. I said, ""You know Hank, tell me."" He said, ""I don't know and I don't know the names of the horses."" As he walked away, he said Corralee or Correlee would win the first race. He kind of mumbled it. I didn't quite get the right name."
"0918"	"(06/07/63)"	"I was in the country where there was a restricted area. We went into it and then found out there was a lone gunman in this area and he didn't want anyone to get hurt by this fast gun, so he had it restricted. We had with us a better gunman than this bad hombre so as the two men were to meet one of them, fell and his gun went off accidentally, which gave the signal for the two to go at each other. I was using a street sweeper and sweeping the street. I was on a bank of earth and I slid down the side of the bank about three times. I saw Mr. Knetz. He was stout now. Judy moved her bowels in her diaper as I held her and to my embarrassment, I got my shirt soiled with her dirty diaper."
"0919"	"(06/08/63)"	"I was walking thru the shop at White's and I only had a tee shirt on and the rest of my body was exposed, nude. I was embarrassed and tried to cover my generative organs as I walked thru. I looked at Rose Ann Esinski's foot. She had a wide, flat ankle and a long foot. It just appeared in front of me without the rest of her body or other foot."
"0920"	"(06/09/63)"	"I was intimating my wife, but she was just a girlfriend in my dream. I was single. I intimated her in different places. Once I was in bed with her and her brother came in as I was lying in bed with her. He looked our way, but I was behind my wife and covered up. He didn't see me. Then we went out in the woods and I found a good hiding place. We crawled into the bushes and I told her, ""Now this is a very good place. No one can see us."" So I started to intimate her again and she was willing and ready for me all the time. I seemed to be running away in flight from a bull. I am not sure or clear on this."
"0921"	"(06/12/63)"	"I was going to intimate my wife. I put a lot of lubricant on my penis. We were on the front porch and I told my wife, ""Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen."" It was Sunday and I was fixing something that was broken."
"0922"	"(06/13/63)"	"I was watching an older man, but he tried to fool. He couldn't hit when a ball was pitched to him. He gave a mighty swing and missed. We were eating. I ate a big potato chip out of the frying pan and meat also. I picked Jack Lasko up. One arm and then let him fall and he said he hurt his back. I was very strong."
"0923"	"(06/14/63)"	"I was working in Fairmont Dairy. A fellow who worked there was also driving a school lbus. He had an accident with it and it was his fault because he gave the wrong number of horn signals. I was driving our car and I parked it and to my surprise the brake pedal went down very low like it sprung a leak."
"0924"	"(06/14/63)"	"My penis was painted half red on the head. I was puzzled how it happened, but it was colored with something."
"0925"	"(06/15/63)"	"I saw Jabber Box as a winner."
"0926"	"(06/16/63)"	"I was at the race track. The races were over and the audience was out. It was empty. I came to the gate and looked to see what the daily double was and the lights were on the mutuals and 8-8 was the daily double that won that day."
"0927"	"(06/17/63)"	"Ann came to Dill's with me. She walked thru our department and was looking at parts that she wanted to take home, but was not allowed to because the parts were made just for certain things and a certain amount. She walked fast ahead of me, to my surprise, because she walked slower than I."
"0928"	"(06/19/63)"	"I was sleeping upstairs and Ann came up to see me."
"0929"	"(06/19/63)"	"A neighbor of a property I bought had kindling wood piled against my fence and it was on fire. I was going over there to put it out with a hose. We were preparing for winter. I was going to order some coal. I looked into the shed and there was very little coal left. There was a plastic tub in there."
"0930"	"(06/20/63)"	"I was at the work and was washing out or cooking corn. I was making a good size bolt with a hole in it."
"0931"	"(06/21/63)"	"I turned down a brass bar and another fellow turned down another bar. He was instructor in an industrial school. My bar was a little darker where it was turned down than the other bar. I was saying or heard the second selection. Now I can't recall it. It was in the first or second race at Detroit track was going to win his race. I can't recall the name. I was driving and there were a lot of traffic lights where we had to make stops. I drove down a hill and it was icy. I had to make a sharp turn on the bottom and I made it."
"0932"	"(06/21/63)"	"Carl Fischer and I were walking by an old tree that was on a bank above us. I said, ""That tree will fall one of these days."" The next day we went by and as I passed it, I commanded the tree to fall. I said, ""Fall now,"" and to my surprise, it started to fall and down it came. I met Bob and some of his friends and I was telling them about the tree, but they were not interested. Ann was sitting by the wall holding our small baby and she said, ""I smell gas."" I looked down a protruding pipe and I could hear the gas coming out. The cap was removed by someone. Mike Pavlic (deceased) was in our home. We had a big sewer hole for the water to run thru. I looked down and there was a fire in the bottom of the hole."
"0933"	"(06/22/63)"	"I was going to call a friend of mine. She called me before and now I called her and the phone rang and rang, then finally someone picked up the receiver and I waited for someone to answer. Andy P. and another fellow stopped by and I thought they were nosy for trying to listen to my conversation."
"0934"	"(06/23/63)"	"I looked out into the back yard and there was a red wheelbarrow turned upside down. It was a full size wheelbarrow for Judy. Ann said, ""Wait till Dad sees the legs on it."" I came close and I noticed that the two legs on the wheelbarrow were short and loose, which I would have to brace up. I was trying to stick a big pad on the rug, but it would not adhere. I went to the drugstore and asked for a loaf of bread, and the lady said, ""We have none."" I looked at a cherry pie which was about 4 inches thick and was about half eaten by the girl. She would go by it and take off a piece o fit with her finger and eat it. I was walking by some people and my generating organ was rigid. I looked at my pants to see if they protruded too much to be noticeable, but they were not too noticeable. I was looking at my tomato plants in the garden and they were kind of wilted."
"0935"	"(06/24/63)"	"I was looking at the selections of the daily double and I saw 5-3, then I moved over and looked at it closer and it seemed to change to 3-4. I think it also changed to 5-1. We were walking in the country. We walked into a field and there was a plum orchard. Couple of my friends took some plums and the farmer ran around the fence and was throwing plums at them."
"0936"	"(06/24/63)"	"I seemed to see #7 for the first race at Thistle."
"0937"	"(06/24/63)"	"I was working at Dill's. I got a lot of oil splashed on my shirt. John Walker told us that the three big shots lied to each other and the truth came out. I counted the machines on my line and they had put three more on the line and they were set close. I had two machines so close that when they were running the indexes  locked or jammed from one machine to the other. I had a machine running 363 screw that we used to make at White Machine Co. I was repeating Jet Marble."
"0938"	"(06/25/63)"	"I was in the back yard and I heard someone breaking something. I went back and someone was stealing my coal. I yelled at the kids and they went to the front of the yard. I heard that breaking noise, so I go to the front yard and there they are again stealing my coal. I talked to a girl and told her I could have her arrested for stealing my coal. She said, ""Go ahead, I don't care."" Then I met a young lady. She came up close to me. I put my arms around her and I held her close. She liked it. I bumped her body with my generative organs against hers and she liked that very much. She said, ""I want children and can't have them."" I said, ""Why not? What's the reason?"" She said, ""My husband gets it in, but he can't come."" I said, ""If you need a little help, I would be happy to help you out."" So we're lying on the garage floor. She was on top of me and we were intimating. The garage door was partly open. I closed it with my foot, but still we could be seen from the outside. I slid on my back with her further back into the garage, but the walls seemed to hold no protection. We still could be seen. Two women and a man came near us and one of the women said, ""Will you fix me up for $5?"" and I said, ""I will."" There were boys in our back yard. I told them to get out and stay out."
"0939"	"(06/26/63)"	"We were traveling in our car. Someone was driving. It was dark, then the clouds started to break up and the sun came out near the horizon, near sunset. We passed thru a town. I wondered how the people made a living. It was small. There was a lake or pond. We stopped and watched a boy catching fish in a net. Carl Fischer and I were back at White's. Bob Lippert came in and I asked the boss if he was coming back. He said he was working here on some other job. He mentioned. I can't recall now. Joe Gruber, our boss at White's, had us move a big pile of old clothes or rags. I was kind of raking them along to a different pile."
"0940"	"(06/27/63)"	"I played Jet Marble. I almost missed him because he was on the back of the page where the entries were. He won. I was on our side street. A big truck came by and then a ditch or trench digger was digging a deep ditch on the side street. The man was in the water in the ditch holding the digger and in water up to his shoulders. The water was dirty. Ann was standing in the water also. Then she swam across the little pond of dirty water. She was black from it. I was surprised she could swim. Her head went under and she came up all dirty. I wrote my dream on the paper, so I wouldn't forget it."
"0941"	"(06/27/63)"	"I was repeating Slipton Fell, then Hatchet came to me. I met Eleanor from White's on the street at night. She walked away from me. I walked after her, got her by the arm and we went between two buildings. I laid her down in the snow, picked up her dress and intimated her. Bob drove up with his car and the mud was all over his car and caked dry."
"0942"	"(06/28/63)"	"I was lying down and I thought what horse would win and Sir Kanter came to me, like I heard it repeated."
"0943"	"(06/28/63)"	"I had two loaves of bread and was sitting and waiting for something or somebody. I can't recall now. Carl Fischer, Andy and I were working at White's again. This time it seemed real. I told Carl now finally we are working at White's and this is no dream."
"0944"	"(06/29/63)"	"806 came to my mind as a double. I was going to watch a stage play. Something happened to one of the players or actors, so I was asked to go on in his place. I took the part and dressed up, but I noticed a little gray beard on my face, so I got ready and our act was almost ready to go on and I said, ""Now what are my lines?"" and stage manager was surprised and stunned. Here I was, ready to go on and didn't know my lines. He told me the lines and I went on. I was not stage frightened. I repeated my lines to the girl. I had a partner and I acted natural, and it came out swell. I was congratulated for a good performance."
"0945"	"(06/29/63)"	"I was out hunting in the country."
"0946"	"(10/23/63)"	"We were going to play ball. One of the choosers of teams said, ""I will take Evans."" He chose me as the first player. I told the kids he chose me because he had to choose me on one team and the other big fellow was chosen on the other team because you smaller boys would squawk if we two big ones were on one team. I was in a man's basement. I looked it over. It was quite narrow, but a long room. I went to another basement. It was a bank room. A fellow banker was giving instructions on how the safe was used. I was cooking a meal. I found an Indian head penny."
"0947"	"(10/27/63)"	"I was walking behind a college graduate. It seemed like Bob Lasko, Tommy Lasko's son. He was short, but walked proudly. He went into a building and Judy didn't want to go in with Ann and I, but I coaxed her to go in."
"0948"	"(10/29/63)"	"I was in Rivertown, my boyhood town. I was hiding under something and something like sand or earth came down on me or snow and I was buried under it. I noticed it was hard to breathe under there. I moved myself up and made more room to breathe. I was then out and looking for myself where I was buried. Then I was a prisoner held by some foreign power or a bandit gang. It was not clear to me."
"0949"	"(10/30/63)"	"I was watching a pop man deliver pop for some kind of game. I noticed a new brand of some kind, but it belonged to the coke company. I was watching Andy K. doing his work. He sure was poky. Judy called to me if the bottles were 5 cents refund and I said, ""Let me see the bottles."" And she picked up a big bottle. It was about 3 ft. long and about 18 inches in diameter."
"0950"	"(10/31/63)"	"I said Wampus when I awoke. I was watching boys play ball. The catcher threw a fastball to the end basement at every pitch from the pitcher. I was supposed to be a little off the mind as I saw it. How I was being treated by some friends and I was thinking they were off the beam as I saw it. I was supposed to be very strong and they knew it and were very friendly to me. I think I heard one was the only one I had my eyes on the people who thought I was off and I could see their eyes looking at me."
"0951"	"(10/31/63)"	"We were out in the yard and plane came by. A lady was piloting it. I know her but can't recall her now. She was flying low, just skimming the roof tops. Then she came down and just touched the ground and went back up. Finally she came down and made a landing on the back end of the plan, which was flat with a lot of prongs or posts on the tail of the plane. There were a lot of children on the plane. When it finally settled down, it tipped and fell on its side. The pilot fell on the ground and was caught by the other children. We looked away and then at the plane again, and there was nothing there. The plane was gone. Ann and I stopped in a bakery. I looked at the delicious hard buns. We waited to get waited on and I looked at a wrap in some kind o f solution in a tub. I got a stick and picked it up and swished it. It was washed clean. Ann was making sandwiches and Judy said Carter was upstairs. I walked up and on the landing I met Carter. He was nude with a towel in his hand, going to the bathroom. When I met him, he was so startled, he stopped dead in his tracks and started to shake from the sudden surprise. Then he put his towel around his body and was nervously moving it around. I could see his penis. It was out as he talked to me."
"0952"	"(11/01/63)"	"I was inside a building. It had a very high ceiling about 125 ft. up. I looked up and said that could be easily painted if you had a long tube that would reach up to the ceiling and spray it. I was like Hank Seegert's brother. We were looking around the house where we made repairs and touchups because we were going to sell the house. I was hammering on a sheet metal piece that was rusted thru to make the in even and look whole."
"0953"	"(11/02/63)"	"I was watching a horse race. I saw Catch Me."
"0954"	"(11/03/63)"	"I was watching an object come down from above. I made my body like tense as though I would force the object to explode and it did and blew to bits and the evidence was gone. I was called or invited to a farmhouse. When I got there, no one was there and the neighbor was calling something to catch us at the farm as though we were raiding the place or broke in. This woman planned this and wanted us to get caught in an innocent affair. I saw this, so we got away and her plans didn't work. We were in the country. Someone pointed an imaginary gun at some animals in the forest as they watched them move along."
"0955"	"(11/03/63)"	"I was batting ball or playing ball. I thought I would hit harder, so I swung hard and hit one far on top of a bank where there was a railroad track. I saw where the ball hit and duct went up from where it landed. I went to look for the ball with another fellow and I found the ball. It was lying in a hole where a pipe was and the impact of the ball made a dent or nick in the ball. I was working and wanted to see Banks about something. I found him and John Serin washing windows."
"0956"	"(11/04/63)"	"I was watching a football game. It was played on a roof of a building and it was a roof that was not flat, but an angle like an ordinary house, but not quiet so steep. They made a play and the players were crawling along the man with the ball made a touchdown and the game was over. I was in a cafe and was looking for a big man that was wanted by a certain man. I shook hands with another big man who knew me and wanted to buy me a drink. We were watching three horses that were being ridden by three boys. This was on sand. It was like a desert or a seashore. One of the boys started his horse. He ran over the sand and the boy fell off the horse. The horse kept on going for quite a spell, then turned and came back and he was ferocious looking as he came charging at us. We all ran for cover. Three of us ran into a building like a barn. I got up out of his reach. The horse came in very fast and then looked for us. He came at us very wild-like. I was high, but still within his reach. He then turned into a man. I had an object in my hand for protection. I then flew outside in flight from him and he was after me. I flew and flew and then he started to sing and this was like a movie being taken. I thought the acting was easy because I didn't talk, just perform. I was sticking some label on a book or into a book. I was playing cards and the cards seemed to be torn. I played the last card and couldn't see what it was and threw one of my good cards and Ann took it from me. I complained it was dark and I couldn't see what the card was."
"0957"	"(11/05/63)"	"I saw Gruber. I went outside and it was dark. I was going to go to a store next door, but was afraid someone would rob me. I finally went and then walked into a dark store with my hands extended out, feeling my way. I came to a lady. I put my arms around her, hugged her, then kissed her. Her kisses were really sweet and thrilling. We were standing near a dress rack, so I pulled her down and under the dresses. Then I was outside. I met a lady. I hugged and kissed her. Then I pulled up her dress and was going to intimate her, but my penis was caught under something and I couldn't get it into the lady. Then I met Mrs. Lippert. She sat down in front of me and spread her legs. I looked between her legs,  but she had pants on and looked pregnant."
"0958"	"(11/06/63)"	"I was in Fairchance, a town of my boyhood days. I drove my Pontiac up the hill of the town and when I was nearing the top, a truck passed me up because my car was slowing up from the steep hill. Near the top the traffic light changed to green, so I shifted to second and passed the truck. Someone was telling me he bet $600 on a horse and won $2000. The bookie came over and said that it was only $1000 won by what the horse paid to win. The boy figured by the odds on the scratch, but they were different at the track. He gave me the $1000 in a roll of bills. I put them in my shirt pocket because the boy was not there. He gave me the results on the name of the horse. He or someone had written over it with a pencil. It was marked. I looked thru my magnifying glass and couldn't make it out. So I looked at the paper and I couldn't find the race results. There was spaces on the paper like where there are results, but I didn't see no results. It was blank. The farmer was amazed by his boy winning that money. As I rode in the buggy to the farmhouse, we passed a neighbor of his and she said, ""You were lucky, Sonny."" The father said, ""How did you get so much money to bet?"" The farmer lady heard him ask the boy, so she said, ""I gave him the money."" He was surprised. I cannot recall the name of the horse that the boy bet."
"0959"	"(11/07/63)"	"I was working at White's and John Serino was foreman. I got a cold and they put me in a hospital because there was not much work. I lay there and some woman patient came in and lay beside me. I held her hand and she liked it. She said it made her feel better. I then went home and came back the next day. I asked John Serino to get a check out from the hospital. I got in a line and there were a lot of people. I went into another line and it was the wrong line. Then I went and asked for information and he fellow asked me if I was religious and I said I was, so he said, ""You go down to the end of the room."" As I walked, I saw nuns in that dept. So I stopped and turned back because they were serving meals. I met John Arendar outside and we talked. I told him we had very little work. I was in the shop and machines have been moved and I was replacing some of the things. I pushed a pump into the ground and then I turned the faucet and the water gushed out. I was dreaming of horses. There were strips of a sort of barrel like and each strip was a name of a horse. I can't recall any names now."
"0960"	"(11/08/63)"	"A fellow was guessing what was behind tags and one was Wading. I am almost sure one was surprised. The next time he guessed, he said wading when he came to that certain tag. I saw no wheel on top of the tags or above them rather."
"0961"	"(11/08/63)"	"I was getting ready to go to work. Bob was tinkering with my car, so I took a walk to Tony Marlot's cafe. I asked Julia Marlot for a shot and coke. She gave it to me. I drank it and she gave me a free one then. I put a half dollar on the bar and she gave me the change as I walked out. I looked at it and I had about 4 dimes and some pennies. I thought to myself she made a mistake and gave me change for a dollar. I met a fellow on the way out. He asked me for 15 cents. I ignored him and walked out. When I got out on the sidewalk, a young fellow said, ""You forgot to give the fellow inside 15 cents. He asked you. He won't like that, so I will have to get it."" I thought for a moment and said, ""I may beat up the fellow and still he may beat me up. I'm going to work now, so it's not worth 15 cents,"" so I gave the fellow 15 cents. I went across the street and the traffic was heavy. The drugstore man said, ""We don't sell the paper, but we're getting it soon."" I came home and went into our bedroom, walked thru a door and was in Yankua's bedroom, our Rivertown neighbor. Someone was in bed sleeping. I walked back out and jumped from the porch and was going to fly to my car. Ann said, ""Judy is coming down the street. She wants to give you a kiss."" I looked down the street in Rivertown and at first I saw a light and this light turned into Judy. She was running. Then Audrey and some other girl were running. They passed Judy up and came to me. One of the girls was down like doing the splits, but she was showing how she runs and it bothers her when she does. They were running very fast."
"0962"	"(11/08/63)"	"I went out with Ann to see somebody. She called somebody and the father of the man answered the phone. I could hear him say he isn't home as I was by his house. His house was dark and it was an old, shabby one. The homes were all shabby. Ann went into the house and a friend and I went out to look for my car. I took out a flashlight and we walked thru a field. We stopped by an old house or barn. I flashed the light under the building and looked under there. I saw two eyes flash under there. So I flashed the light all over and finally spotted a rat running. He ran up a pipe and down into water. He went under to the sewer. I was in Rivertown in a field. There were two tents up. The boys were camping overnight. I looked at the Sweeney Hill place of my boyhood days."
"0963"	"(11/09/63)"	"I was setting up a job. I had a hard time getting a slot in the setup."
"0964"	"(11/10/63)"	"I was downtown. I met Clarence Fassinger farmer. He was coming home from work. I walked with him. We came to a fence. I was going to climb over it, but thought of the bulls in the field. Just then the fence started to fall over from my weight, so I jumped off. It was dark and I was feeling my way along the cliff top. We went to a church that was being built as we walked by the regular church. There was mass going on and I could hear the priest intoning."
"0965"	"(11/10/63)"	"We were like in the Army. The enemy and our men were for St. Claire Ave. The enemy and our men tried to get one another's positions and get as close as possible without being recognized. I was like on a side watching that our men would move up one at a time and when he saw the enemy, he would make a quick change of appearance to a woman and then to a boy and seem to disappear completely. Then at last all of them were changed to sisters or nuns in their hoods. They stood where Bob was standing. There also in his sister's hood and outfit. I called to him and said, ""Bob, now all of you are in sister outfits."" Then the test was over. I walked with Bob and he said, ""Now I see why I would like to be in first class in the service."" My Uncle Jon was at our home. He and my dad were downstairs as we were upstairs in bed in my mother's house. We heard a commotion downstairs, so went down. My dad was holding a file or some object in his hand or a dagger. I started to bawl him out for starting to argue and fight with my uncle. I also panned out my uncle the same. My uncle had a pistol. He pulled it out and started to shoot. I went up to him and took it away from him. It was a 22-caliber pistol, but I was surprised at how heavy it was. Then I looked at the wall and started to count the holes in the wall. We had sheet metal on the wall and there were about 50 holes thru it from my uncle's pistol shots. I met John Wiatrak somewhere. I can't recall now, but it was that he did something careless and I told him about it."
"0966"	"(11/10/63)"	"I was doing something on my desk and it was covered with a canvas. It caught fire and I had to use a ladle to put it out with."
"0967"	"(11/11/63)"	"We had a contest giving 1st prize to best way to treat a customer. Mike F. won by saying he would be nice to people and talk nice and softly to them. We were playing ball and I hit them far and hard. I seemed to be the best one on the team. We were in Pittsburgh. I took Judy by the hand and we went on a bridge. We looked down into the water at a boat. There were two beetles flying around. They landed on the ceiling, walked around, then fell to the floor with the paper someone pasted up for them to stick up there. One of the horses I have picked won, but I don't know which one it is."
"0968"	"(11/11/63)"	"I was in the basement and a fellow was putting perpetual lights by each window. It was a small flame, which burned continuous. I liked it, but said, ""What if it starts a fire if it falls on the wood which holds the small stand?"""
"0969"	"(11/12/63)"	"I went into some building adjoining our house with Judy. I was looking for something when May Schneider came in. I said, ""Hello, May."" She said, ""How are you, John?"" I said, ""Wonderful."" I said, ""Come here, May."" She did and we got behind a partition from Judy's view. I put my arms around her, hugged and kissed her and then I picked up her skirt and she said no. I said, ""I won't hurt you."" I was ready to intimate her when my wife came in, but didn't see what I was going to do. I quickly opened a door to another room and there was an old tricycle there among some old junk. I said to may maybe she would like that old bike, just faking it, and May said, ""I will tell her and she may buy it."" So I got out of a tough pinch. Then we were on the lawn and there was a limb from a thorny tree on the lawn. I broke it in two and threw one part on Lattimer's lawn and the other one across the other side and this one landed on one end and stuck in the ground and sort of shipped over and hit a dog. The master looked at the dog's eye, but he seemed to be okay. He said nothing. I saw Mr. Garchew, a name of a horse. I was in Rivertown drawing coke. I went inside the of the coke oven and got all of the coke out from the rear of the oven."
"0970"	"(11/13/63)"	"Carl Fisher and I were waiting in the car for a motel room. The young girl who was renting them was walking around our car and hinting what she would like to do, but had no time for it. My penis was erect and I had my hand on it because Carl was feeling for it to see if it was erect. We drove around the motel on the other side and the proprietor said, ""You are parking on Grania's property and furthermore, I will not let you have a room because I don't rent to killers."" He thought Carl had killed a man, so he would not rent us a motel. I explained to him that he was wrong about Carl because Carl had a hard time killing a fly and someone had spread a wrong rumor. The proprietor then became very friendly. Carl took out some pork chops and fried them very slightly and they had a feast, but I would not eat any because they were practically raw. Denny Carter drove his dad's car to PA and back and said the gas was leaking."
"0971"	"(11/14/63)"	"We were in the country and I saw a lot of snakes. Their heads were sticking out of the ground. I found a windowpane of glass. I put it on the snake's neck and cut off his head. I did that about to three snakes."
"0972"	"(11/15/63)"	"I was at our old home on East 68th St. I was in the attic and I saw a pheasant up there. It flew out. We had sleeping quarters there. One of the beds squeaked and when someone slept on it, it squeaked and kind of frightened them. Then I was by my mother's house and I looked out the window and Mary had a cross made of paper outside as a Christmas decoration. We had a photographer come over and he was going to take our pictures. My brother Steve was dressed for the occasion."
"0973"	"(11/16/63)"	"I was razzing Danny Shane from Dill's. He was worried how he would get home on a bus when he only lived two blocks from the bus. We had a union meeting and passed some kind of resolution that was delayed by the previous meeting."
"0974"	"(11/17/63)"	"I saw Table Twister and two other horses, but I can't recall them. I saw a sister nun on the street walking with another lady. I stopped my car by a crosswalk or street by a wall. I couldn't see if anyone was walking, but a crowd of people were coming out on two occasions and the same man came first both times and made off as if I bumped him. I expressed with my hands how far I was away from him and he grinned because he was kidding. I looked thru the window and I saw a brick some stack on a slant. I told the people to look, the smoke stack is falling down. We looked and it crashed to earth. I said, ""Now it will shake the earth."" We stood still and it shook the house. I looked at the sky and it was very dark in the west like a storm coming."
"0975"	"(11/18/63)"	"I was working or operating the B and S in Dill's. When it was near quitting time, I counted 20 machines that I operated. I was resetting one that the tools didn't work properly. Then I wiped the oil off the machines as we usually do at the end of a shift."
"0976"	"(11/19/63)"	"We were inside of a big rock. We had it hollowed out into one big room. It was about a hundred feet high and the same for the width of the inside. I looked up at the high ceiling and walls and said, ""What a nice, smooth, hard rock."" We had done a good job. I was peeling off the rock crust which made the rock smooth and polished like. I was also peeling the skin off an apple with my fingernails, the rock also with my nails. We had some rocks on the lawn also."
"0977"	"(11/19/63)"	"The wind started to blow. It blew thru a door. It folded a blanket, then rolled it across the room to another screen door. The force of the wind pushed the door open and the blanket rolled away by the force of the wind."
"0978"	"(11/20/63)"	"I was in Rivertown. I was by my old schoolhouse of my boyhood days. There were some flowers and also sunflowers growing on top of the schoolhouse roof. I looked at the street I lived on and I seemed to be living there again. We had a horse. And Judy took a walk to visit a lady friend. I walked there later and Judy was walking in the mud. At first I thought she was walking barefooted, but she walked toward me and she had on my big shoes and walked on top of the mud. I was going to walk home. I found a good file lying on the street. I put it under my arm, then I found a knife. Then I saw a lot of tools lying on the ground. Marge Rudis was the party Ann was visiting and Frank had all his tools scattered around by his son Alan. I told Marge she had better tell Alan not to leave the tools on the street because the school children walk by and will pick them up. I was listening to a foreign woman talk. She could talk quite good American. I also helped her by interpreting some of my father's language from Slovak to American."
"0979"	"(11/21/63)"	"I was in Burger's fruit market. I was surprised how long the store was. It was about 50 ft. wide and one block lone, one street to another."
"0980"	"(11/22/63)"	"I was sitting near a dentist's room and I could hear the patients moan when he was extracting their teeth."
"0981"	"(11/23/63)"	"I was buying another car and mine was getting the upholstery repaired or repaired also the body work was going to be done. I was selling the car for $250 and Bob got it. He said the man wanted to buy it for $500. I went out to see the fellow and he said, ""I'll give you $500 for your car,"" and I made off. I was not interested in the price, but then I said, ""Oh, alright, I will take it."" While I was getting the bill of sales for a signature, he had the $500 on a pile. I was following a fellow on a road. He was outside the car. He would give it a little push, then let it get in front of him and gradually it slowed up and he caught up with it. He did this several times till he hit a downgrade in the road and the car got away from him and ran down the hill without a driver. He stood there in a daze. The car caused $150,000 damage to other cars. I was looking at the entries and there was a new system or the names of horses were puzzling. You turned a dial and names would come up. I can't recall any of the names now. It was one track that had this system. Mrs. Durdall was familiar with this system and she played it. It had bright colors on its dialing face."
"0982"	"(11/23/63)"	"I was hanging up an artificial flower on our wall. I cut off some of the edge flower stems, and gave it to Ann for her lapel. Al from Dill's came in and was he dressed sharp. He had a fancy colored coat. He looked at Ann's coat on a chair and said, ""Are you going to wear that?"" and she said, ""I am."" He said, ""The people are going to be dressed their best for this dancing party."" The band or orchestra started to play. I saw a horse turn a direction peg in the opposite direction. It was pointing just as a joke on his master."
"0983"	"(11/24/63)"	"I was fixing some kind of cart. It had single wheels on it so I was going to put on double wheels. It would run better. I picked out a horse to win and he won. The next time the one that ran 2nd I picked he won the next time he ran. I can't recall the names now. I was changing my clothes in the shop. We were going to have a party. Charley Charvat was with us. I noticed I had on a pair of red woolen long hunting socks. I put on my suit. It seemed my pants were too long. I looked into the mirror and I was fat or stout. My waistline was about fifty inches. I was really fat."
"0984"	"(11/24/63)"	"I was at Grandma's house. Denny Carter and his wife were there. They had two daughters. One was walking and the other one was still small and in a buggy. The walking one went to the buggy and I was afraid it would harm the small one by scratching the eyes for face, but she just looked at it and went on walking. There was a big fly in the house. I got the fly swatter and hit the big fly and knocked it down on the floor. There were a lot of small flies on the floor, so I was swatting them all. We had two trees in the kitchen. My brother Steve said, ""Looks like one of them moved a little to the falling stage."" I looked and sure enough, down it came. Then sometime later the other tree came down also. It hit the window, broke the panes, then when the top of the tree went thru the window as the top hit the ground, it flopped over and landed on the neighbor's driveway. To my surprise, the trees were about 40 ft. high and still they were supposed to be growing in my mother's kitchen and the ceiling is only 9 ft. high. I went outside and looked at the tree. It lay on the neighbor's driveway. I thought of calling the press and have a photographer come and take a picture of it. It was an unusual freak of work. I was looking at a neighbor's name plate on his house and it was Buick."
"0985"	"(11/25/63)"	"I looked at a big cloud or substance up above the earth, which was a threat to us to surrender or it would be dropped upon us. We somehow got away from it and were safe. I thought of this as a fire horse. It would win and a fire horse did win. I found out later. Substance above was a big fire."
"0986"	"(11/25/63)"	"A fellow came into the shop with big balloons like a life preserver float on water. I asked him for one and he gave it to me. I blew air into it and the air was coming out of the many shut or cork plugs. It had caps like on a beach ball tube shut off. There were about 5 or 6 of them. When I got all of them closed, the air stayed in the float or balloon. A fellow was parking his car. He drove away and I saw 22 pellets on the street. I picked them up. I also found a bb bullet, a tiny one. I pulled one pellet out of one of the bullets and then threw it down and it exploded. The boss told us to take some kind of material. It was paper or wood. I can' recall now. We delivered it to the woodwork. Later I found out it was delivered to the wrong dept. I met Cecilia, an old friend of my sister Mary from White Sewing Machine. She talked to me and wanted to get the address of some firm that sold 22 rifles. Then she wanted my phone number and I knew why she wanted my number so she could call me for a date."
"0987"	"(11/26/63)"	"I saw a moon horse either ran 2nd or was picked 2nd. I parked my car, then got out and picked up a baby boy. The boy was kind of rough and we talked in his language, baby talk. My car was backing up. I put on the brake and it wouldn't stop, so I put it in gear and released the clutch pedal so the car was in gear. It would go forward and stop the car. It went back for a while, then it finally stopped and moved forward."
"0988"	"(11/27/63)"	"I was at a party with Ann and Judy. I met George Gedeon. We talked about our families. He had one daughter and I was not sure if he had two daughters and the three boys. Later we were with Elsie Lasko. We were looking at a derrick at a distance, which was clearing a way for some homes to be built. I later met May Speck. I called her over to another room and loved her up, but Ann came in and we had to break up. Later Ann went out for Judy, who was a ways away with other people. I called May over to me. She came and we embraced and she went into another room of a shanty like and lay flat on her back. I lay on top of her and we loved and had intercourse. She enjoyed it very much and so did I. Ann was coming back with Judy, so we had to separate again. May went to another room and I just went into a corner of the shanty and lay down to hide from Ann. She walked right by me with Judy and didn't see me. I was looking at a portrait of a man that was beat up. He had clothes and skin breaks on his face."
"0989"	"(11/27/63)"	"My sister Mary and Ann and Steve were cleaning up the debris in the yard. I tried to get my sister to come into the garage, but she wouldn't go in. I looked at a small three and there were ripe cherries left over from the past winter. I picked them. There was also a peach on the cherry tree. I looked at it and it was not so good. I threw it at a rabbit sitting on the road. Bob and I picked up a few rocks and threw it at the rabbit."
"0990"	"(11/28/63)"	"I was watching a prisoner or surrendered bandit get roughed up. He surrendered, put up his hands and the guard or policeman kept on firing and the prisoner kept on falling and backing up."
"0991"	"(11/28/63)"	"I dozed off watching TV and I saw the name story."
"0992"	"(11/29/63)"	"We were in a town and still it was like a jungle. There were large trees and lions prowled and would catch a human being once in a while and would devour them. We were up in trees most of the time to be safe. We climbed around in the top of trees. Someone said, ""Did you see that lion grab that man and drag him into the underbrush? Then there came a lion down the street. He trotted down slowly, then changed his mind, stopped, turned and trotted back. Someone said a lion attacked a boy and he got away from the lion. There was a record played near the attack. It was loud music and singing. This frightened away the lion. I was lying in wait for some robbers who were to come and steal our money. They finally came in and I surprised them with my pistol. I pointed it at them and they didn't put up their hands at my command, so I tried to shoot and the gun wouldn't fire. So when they saw that I was their prisoner, but they let me go later."
"0993"	"(11/29/63)"	"I was working in the shop. I went to the men's room and the toilets were exposed. No doors and girls worked there and could see you on the toilet. I looked to see where the girls went and they had a closed room with a sign ""Women"" on the door. Al gave me the paper and said he had a $80 winner."
"0994"	"(11/30/63)"	"I seemed to have my head covered with a big piece of tape and I wanted to get out, but the tape was holding me down and I could hardly breathe. On two occasions this was done."
"0995"	"(11/30/63)"	"I was in flight from somebody. I escaped and then ran and flew away from my captors. I came to a cave. It had a door on the entrance and the doorway was full of cobwebs. I brushed them aside and went inside. I looked down a stairway and it was dim, but I saw a figure of man. He was supposed to be a hermit or spook. He yelled up at me, ""Now that you came in, you are not going to get out."" I started to go out and all at once I was like in a shop and Ed, the coal miner, was trying to keep me from escaping. I pushed him and he fell down, but he held onto me. So I took one of his arms and hooked ist on one of the rotating turrets. He begged me to free him that he would help me to escape. So I freed his arm and he showed me the way to the escape door. I gave him a cigar and when I got outside, I flew over the valley and was repeating, ""I'm coming home to my Ann."""
"0996"	"(11/30/63)"	"I went to a race track. I heard someone say 11 pp. horse was going to win in a race that was coming up. I heard it from a gang of women. We were sitting and were trying to keep it a secret. I was going to bet on it. I came to a fence and the track was foggy. I wondered how the race could be run when you could only see about 50 ft. ahead of you. I had to crawl thru a fence, then I helped a man with his son. I held the wires apart open for them to get thru. I was walking thru a seated crowd of people. I looked and saw a husky woman sitting, her knees up and her body was nude below her waistline. I saw her sex organs. I thought I would go have a good look. So I walked closer and looked. The woman was exposed nude. I went down on my knees and hands. I wanted to take a good look at her sex organs and they were quite big and seemed like a small penis sticking out from her vagina."
"0997"	"(12/01/63)"	"I had tickets to a movie show. I went to the movie and the usher gave me a seat in a corner where I had to look around a corner to see the screen."
"0998"	"(12/02/63)"	"I dreamed I played a live horse in the 2nd race. I picked out two reverses in the paper and bet them with Marty. I had a bundle of money in my wallet. We were by the coke ovens in Rivertown and were killing or getting rid of the small pygmy like colored people. We thought we were rid of them. Then we saw two of them get into a big cylinder. We filled it with rocks covered them up and knew they would die in there because they couldn't get out. We walked up the cut between the coke cars and we saw one more of the colored men. Then two more, a woman and two boys. I was thinking if we let them live, they will start multiplying again. I got into a steel car that had shelves of tools that were scrapped. I picked out different tools and carried them in my hands. Some picks, hammer files and other tools I thought I could use at home."
"0999"	"(12/03/63)"	"I had a stick and was looking for snakes. I saw one. I swung with the stick and hit him on the head and knocked part of his head off. I killed him and then Joe Gruber yelled while I'm dying give me something to drink. He was supposed to be the snake."
"1000"	"(12/03/63)"	"I was at a party down at White's. We were in the buildings. We looked out the window and there was a commotion. A policeman was outside with George Gedeons' wife. She was complaining that George was neglecting his family, especially the small baby. Then I went outside and Bill Grove was walking down the street imitating different people and a lady with him did the repeat of his. I had a mug of water hanging by a string. Bill Grove spit into my mug. It seemed that the whole country was at a standstill in industry. There were only a few special aluminum jobs being done. Andy P. and a couple other guys were doing the special job. There were crowds of people assembled by White's Sewing Machine Company."
"1001"	"(12/04/63)"	"I was drawing coke when I was thru I looked at myself and I had big muscles and a nice suntan. I felt young, strong and healthy. I was at a race track. The fellows were playing some sort of game. I can't recall if it was tag or football or bowling, etc. The manager of the track called me Evans. I was surprised he knew my name. We walked away from the track. Bob Gibson was at our house. He was doing something on our wall. Ann was admiring him. He was tall and had a young face."
"1002"	"(12/05/63)"	"Steve Potosky and I were in a shop. There was a big machine. I didn't know how to run it. Steve Potosky put a piece of leather in it and it went into the machine. Steve walked on top of the machine, which was low and flat and about 20 ft. square. He walked about three quarters of the way, then came back and the leather came back out with a perfectly built shoe. I looked at it. It had soles and heels and was a high shoe that covered the ankle. I put it on and it fit perfect. I had no tongue or facing, just like a bedroom slipper. I held it up and felt the soft leather. I was by my mother's house and we watched Frank Fledich across the street doing some repair or remodeling on his house. He looked at me and said, ""Look at that guy, how he is relaxed."" The sun was shining and it was a beautiful day. His small boy was on the tree lawn and was stepping around making off. He was measuring or planning how to lay the pavement or some other thing. Audrey came by me and I noticed her underpants were dirty from a bowel movement. I told her and she said, ""Will you come and wipe me off?"" I said I would. Then I told her, ""You better wash yourself off. You are smeared with it."" I picked up a couple bolts and nuts that were lying in a bushel basket. I was driving or steering a streetcar. There was track and there was none and the streetcar ran on the street. I came close to buildings and had to steer it away not to hit them. Then there was traffic coming and I had to stay out of its way. There was a big rail on the street. I steered the car over and across it. I wiped my wife off and some fleas fell on the floor. I had a hard time picking it up. I was embarrassed that Frank F. would see what I was doing."
"1003"	"(12/06/63)"	"I was in Rivertown, the town of my boyhood days. I saw the town and the coke ovens and the coal mines and how the people started these businesses. Then I went to look at the old town to see how it looked. I first saw the town, the homes. They seemed to have been covered over with some kind of a plastic like and the ovens were a little cleaner and clearer. Then I saw an example of a man in the olden times where a rope was tied around the man's waistline and he went into a tunnel or coal mine and was for safety's sake protected by the line or rope to get out safe. Then I went further and I saw a man who was trying to cheat me out of my money I was to get for my venture into the coal mine. I cussed him something terrible and I told my paying man what he was doing. He finally called him out and said, ""This is a son of George Jessel."" Then I was sorry for what I called him and I went up to him and apologized. We shook hands on it. His hand was very sore from something he did in the mine, so I clasped his hand very lightly. I was called by a friend and he had a big, long pork chop for me. It was lean and nice. He started to chop in into chops and his dad came over and said it was not the right way to cut it."
"1004"	"(12/06/63)"	"I was driving. Carl Fisher was with me. I had my old 29 Ford. I got stalled in the center of the street and I couldn't move. I couldn't get the car in gear. So we left it there and I went to see if I could find a garage and have it towed off the street. I was about a block away and looked around and there were two policemen by my car. One was writing out a ticket. They were gone when I got to the car. I had a ticket on the wiper. I got in the car and the traffic was heavy. A streetcar was behind me, waiting for me to get out of the way. He came close and moved my car a little. I finally put it in reverse and drove to the curb backwards. Eddy P. from Dill's came over. He got in my car with Carl and he drove. I was walking on the city street nude, not a stitch of clothing on. I was embarrassed. I had my arms folded and bent over to cover my sex organs.                                   "
"1005"	"(12/07/63)"	"I was at Dill Co. and a fellow came out of the office and I heard over the PA system, ""If you guess who Mr. Dill is, you win $75."" I yelled at the fellow, ""You are Mr. Dill,"" and a fellow near him said that also, after me. He shook hands with him, and I walked up to him and shook hands with him and we went into the office. The fellow and I won the $75. So the man in the office gave us the money. I counted it and only had 20 some odd dollars. I told the fellow that this is not _ of $75. I said it was $37.50. So I counted it over and he gave me a couple of dollars and it was still short, and so was the other fellow's. So he gave me items and said it was worth a dollar and still I was under $30. I must have counted it about 5 times and it was short of the amount. Then I saw small girl children, like Judy, 3 and 4 years old, come in handcuffed like prisoners. A row of them came in, about seven or eight cuffed all together. I looked at them and thought what where they -- prisoners or small shoplifters or what?"
"1006"	"(12/09/63)"	"I was operating my machine in the shop. I forgot about one and the next day I remembered I forgot to load that one machine and it ran empty the next day. So I ran it now. Then I went away and I heard a loud noise like something heavy falling on the floor. I came by one of my machines and I noticed on one of my machines two pulleys came loose from the shaft of the machine and they fell down on the floor. The boss dismissed or discharged one of the workers."
"1007"	"(12/10/63)"	"I was intimating my wife and she said we are going somewhere first. Judy was a little boxer. She had on boxing gloves. Mrs. Kogler was looking for Judy. She came to our door and knocked. I told Judy to let her in and then box her. Judy was kind of afraid when Mrs. Kogler came in, but finally rushed her. Mrs. Kogler fell on her back and put her legs up in the air. I ran up to her and intimated her. She pleaded with me it hurt her, so I let her up."
"1008"	"(12/10/63)"	"We were at a desk filling out income tax or some application and John Ezinski Jr. had my main card of reference and I had to wait for it. There were sparks of fire dropping from something I was holding."
"1009"	"(12/12/63)"	"I saw Infinite Gree and Service Quick as winner."
"1010"	"(12/12/63)"	"I was in the woodwork building White's. I was going to go buy something and I opened a concealed door. Then I had to crawl thru a hole to get out. I had to move a rock in the hole to get through. I twisted the skin of my hand and it broke loose. Then my hand came off. I placed it back on and twisted the skin back into place."
"1011"	"(12/13/63)"	"Al from Dill's said, ""I'm going to play Sidewalls and he is and was a good horse."" I asked him where he was running and he said in Kentucky. I looked at the tracks in a book and I saw the Kentucky track. I looked at a couple races there and didn't see Sidewalls and I awoke. Ann was driving my car. We were riding. My sister Ann was with us. I looked out in a distance and saw Al Lasko's wife Eleanor. I said, ""Look, there is Al's wife."" Ann said, ""She looks like you,"" my sister Ann. We came close and I saw another woman that looked like Al's wife, but she was younger and prettier. I seemed to be at a Florida track or tropical now."
"1012"	"(12/15/63)"	"I robbed someplace with two fellows. I looked at Fairchance, PA and the people were running away from town. They were running on the main road towards us. We were puzzled why they were leaving town. It was at the foot of a mountain. Then I looked into the sky and the moon had an odd shape. It was square like then like a triangle and it was tan color. Then we saw a tree and a bird hopping around the tree looking for some insects to eat."
"1013"	"(12/15/63)"	"I heard 14 + 14 won. I was driving on a road, then all at once there was a steep bank on the road. I pushed the car up it because I was afraid my car wouldn't make it. It was about 6 ft. high and on a 45 degree angle."
"1014"	"(12/16/63)"	"I was in Rivertown, PA. I went to see the boys play ball. I saw the Hegler girls and boys playing ball. I saw a man hitting out balls. Then I was playing ball. Our team beat the other team 20 to about 5. We hit the pitcher all over the lot. He was John Milcan. These were memories of my boyhood days."
"1015"	"(12/16/63)"	"Ann and I were walking thru the slums. I was leery of being robbed. I had money on my person. Then I was with my brother Steve. We came to a manhole or some hold in a grating. We looked thru it and there were two men down there. We wanted to go down there. I yelled down and one man didn't want to move. I was going to drop in a rock. There were a lot of weeds on the grating, so we made a fire and burned the weeds. Then we were down in the hold. It was like a cave and there was a cafe there. I saw a door down there. It seemed to lead outside. Steve washed the dishes and then went out. He had a rifle in his hand and we walked bravely."
"1016"	"(12/17/63)"	"I saw where some treasure was buried and then saw it being taken out and put into a bank. My dad wanted $20 more to go into the $2000 that was taken out of the treasure and I took out some bills. My dad was taking a $25 bill which I was surprised because I didn't know there was a $25 bill. I took it out of his hand gave him a $20 bill. There were some rowdies around and I noticed they were getting ready to go into action about that money because they were paid up to dig it up."
"1017"	"(12/18/63)"	"I was watching Frank Zupanic bowling duck pins. Steve K. was setting up the pins for Frank. They must have had about 40 pins on the alley."
"1018"	"(12/19/63)"	"I saw a fellow worker and he came up to me and said, ""You want to make yourself about $500. Put about $50 on Drummed Out,"" me and another horse. I can't recall now. He said, ""I bet you $20 you will make that I said you will."" I am not quite sure that the two horses mentioned are the ones, but it seems to register."
"1019"	"(12/20/63)"	"I was going to be laid off or thought I would be because there was going to be a cut in the help. The boss brought a bag of work with about 300 pieces of swivels for me to mike or sort out or inspect. He said some are tapered and I should keep the pieces separate as they are sorted out all of same dimensions keep together as they mike. I was in the locker room changing my clothes and the girls were using our room. I took off my pants and shirt and was in my gym shirt and shorts and was embarrassed that the girl would look my underclothes over and think they were soiled. Bob won a daily double. He said it was $55,000. I said no, it was $5,500. There were two people on a board or bridge like which was about four ft. wide. I went on it and all over. I went over the side of it and I hung on the side of the board. The two fellows helped me up on the board."
"1020"	"(12/21/63)"	"I looked at the results and I saw cat and Brave at Sea as winners for the mutuals. There were numbers like 44+ 86 etc. I saw Hornet in parentheses. Not as results as the two above. When I had the paper open on results, Dr. Coon, our country doctor, was standing beside me and when he saw me looking at the race results, he said, ""Oh oh,"" or something about me looking at the results. I had a toy train. It was on a davenport or something like one, only it was long and like on a stairway inclination. I started it and it ran up this inclination, then it started to go to the edge of the davenport and I tried to hurry up and catch it before it fell off, but I seemed to be slow in my hurry and it fell off and rolled on the floor."
"1021"	"(12/22/63)"	"I saw a street sign. It had Turkey on it."
"1022"	"(12/22/63)"	"I was standing on the porch and thinking I was not happy with my life or the vocation I had. I said, 'I think I would be happier with my wife I would divorce her."" Then I was thinking all the bills I had and I am not doing the vocation that would make me happy. Then my sister Mary and brother Steve were there and Ann came out. I took her in my arms and hugged her close and kissed her about five or six times. Once I kissed her with our two noses touching, which was hard to do."
"1023"	"(12/23/63)"	"I was with my dad and Uncle John. My uncle went up to my dad and punched him into the stomach. He felt it, I could see. My dad backed up, then walked up to my uncle and gave him a vicious punch into his stomach, then backed up. Now I could see they were going to fight. They started to walk towards each other, so I walked between them and stopped the fight. Later I was asleep. I got up and was going to go to the bathroom downstairs and I saw my dad sprawled on the stairway asleep. I was on the street and there was a piece of ice about 18 inches thick, about three feet wide and about ten feet long. It was frozen to the sidewalk. I got a long knife and cut thru the ice as though it was butter. I cut out round pieces that looked like barrels and then I ran the knife under the ice and loosened it from the sidewalk, then gave it a push and the ice slid on into the street and blocked it. I was driving my car and the traffic was quite complicated. I thought if I had my motor tuned up by Pontiac service or Esper's garage, it would run better than it does now. I threw a potato that was on fire. I had a tube from the gas tank that I carried to a filling station. It was a pipe like or supposed to be a gas tank. It was about two inches in diameter and had a balloon on one end like a gas tank about four inches in diameter and about 1 foot long. The overall of the pipe was about 4 ft. The gas station attendant put the gas nozzle on the pipe and filled it with gas."
"1024"	"(12/24/63)"	"I was looking at the entries and I had day with 2 pp or #2 to win on him, so I said, ""I may as well play him."" I had a small garden that someone came and paid me rent to use it. I got some papers to enter Italy and also a return paper. I was delivering some items. I made the trip several times. I walked in and out and this seemed to be Rivertown that I was walking thru. There seemed to be a battle of guns at the plant. Fellows had guns and were shooting at one another. I was at White's working. Ernie Keleping had an oil can and was squirting it around. It had a lot of force because it seemed to squirt about a hundred feet. Then Louie Kaufman had a plue can also and was squirting it. They are both dead and were playing with oil cans. I was in Rivertown. Our cow Cherry came to her barn and we were chasing or steering her to the barn. She walked into the garden and lay down on some vegetables. Sister Mary made her get up and go into the barn."
"1025"	"(12/24/63)"	"I saw a girl with a pet of some kind. She stood on the hillside and there was some kind of wild animal sneaking towards her. I called to her, but she was stubborn and wouldn't come down. Finally she came down, but she was a fierce and tough female. I finally got close to her and caressed her and she started to get gentle and was now talking of love that she never had. Ann, my wife, was coming into the room, so she hid under some cardboard boxes and then when Ann went out, I looked for her, but couldn't see her. She disappeared. I was outside. I looked up into the sky and up there was a crow. He was stationary, did not move in the air. Then I saw branches of trees floating in the air with birds sitting on them. I saw two crows. They flew down from a sky perch and landed on a tree. I made a feint as though I had a gun and pointed it at them and away they flew."
"1026"	"(12/25/63)"	"We were climbing thru a window onto some kind of stand which was shaky and about two stories high. Judy also was with us and she almost fell, but I caught hold of her. We were sliding and mixing objects on the floor. The black ones were supposed to be colored people. We mixed them, one here and there among the whites. I was watching boys play baseball and then I joined them and played with them."
"1027"	"(12/25/63)"	"We were moving a home to a different part of town. I was at a party at St. Andrew's parish. I met some people and kids were coming in and raising a rumpus. We were supposed to dine."
"1028"	"(12/26/63)"	"I asked a fellow what I should play and he said, ""Fresh Up"" and another one I can't recall now. I was walking by and I marked or started to write on a bulletin where a fellow was writing on. I marked Jim or started to do it and I did the same on another board with my pen. My pen kind of stuck and I didn't write Jim in full. I was digging or going to dig up roots that few after the plants were cut down and they interfered with the planting in the ground."
"1029"	"(12/27/63)"	"I was taking inventory at Dill's and was working 12 hrs. a day. John gave me two cards. Walter Lusnia punched one of the cards about four times all the way across it. I was surprised one of the kids called me John. I didn't know he knew my name. I got paint on my new shoes."
"1030"	"(12/28/63)"	"I saw Kiss and other results, but I can't recall them now."
"1031"	"(12/28/63)"	"Ann said May had scuttled before and now she didn't play it and it won and paid a bundle. I looked at my dad and he was losing weight. His form or waistline was smaller and he was always touching his abdomen on the right side where he had pain. I ignored it because I knew his ailment was incurable."
"1032"	"(12/29/63)"	"I heard Pine Neck. I wanted to know what the double was at fairground. I saw the double in the paper. The names, but I can't recall the names at fairground."
"1033"	"(12/29/63)"	"I saw the double in tropical and fairgrounds, but I can't recall them now. At fairgrounds the names were supposed to be like plastic or something of plastic. It was a present or gift in a package for the first horse. There was a changing of the names to tropical. My car radiator was leaking. I filled it and ran it for a while and then looked into the radiator and the water was gone. I filled it again and ran the engine again and it was empty again. I looked under the car and didn't notice any leaks. In the other part of the garage there was a water leak out of a faucet or a valve disk like. I tightened the disk and the water stopped from leaking. It was not hooked up with the car water system and I was puzzled how the water from the radiator disappeared through that disk in the garage."
"1034"	"(12/29/63)"	"I was working at White's and Louie Kaufman (deceased) was still foreman. I came in late, went by his desk, looked over the tickets where he had the line of machines for each operator and I couldn't find mine and the others were all nonsense, couldn't understand them. There was a tray of ripe tomatoes on the floor. I pushed them by his desk."
"1035"	"(12/30/63)"	"I went to Sears and Roebuck and bought a recap strip of rubber for recapping a tire. A fellow was going to recap my tire and he said, ""You put on the recap and then run over yourself with the car to press on the recap good and firm."""
"1036"	"(12/30/63)"	"I was at work. I went to the sink in the davenport dept. and I was surprised that dept. was not working. That was about 40 minutes before quitting time. When I came back to our dept., some of the lines were shut off and the lights were out. Carl Fisher had our lights out and he had my tickets written out. I noticed he had a mistake made on some of them and he had Vi and some VII and I looked at the drawing and it was VI on all of them. There were ladies' dust caps on the machine. I was going to put them on the pan of work, but only put one of them. I picked up two red soggy rags from the floor. Then I saw a young lady cry by Paul's line and then walk away and Paul's helper Dick then started to cry as of pain and he sat back in the corner and sort of stretched his body as he cried."
"1037"	"(12/30/63)"	"I was in a big home. I was ours. I saw it being repaired. I looked down the street and elephants were coming up the street. People walked and paid no heed to them. Then all at once one of them started to run fast up Broadway Ave. and about three of them were coming up towards us. Then all at once the three elephants started to run up towards us and the people ran alongside of the elephants and they ran by us. A car stopped beside our home. I heard a voice of a man loud talking to a young girl in the car. Then the two men were colored and the girl was white. She opened the door and went outside and walked away. I looked at our bathroom. We had about four or five toilets. I looked under the walls to see if there was someone there because the water was flushed. I saw a young lady's legs standing in one of the booths, so I walked out of the room. I was cleaning a big wooden dish and a fellow beside me started to cry. When he stopped, I started to cry."
"1038"	"(12/31/63)"	"Something was kissing me on the lips and it was like a spirit. I couldn't see it, but I could feel it and it was taking my breath a little. So I started to move my arms slowly. Then I moved and slapped at it and it let go of me. I was driving a new car. We went over a little bank and we all jumped out of the car. It seemed to disappear over a cliff. We stood there and listened to hear it hit way down below, but didn't hear anything. We went over to the dealer, which was about 200 ft. away, and told him what happened. He told us to look over the bank on the opposite side of the hill and I looked over and under where I was lying down and there was a garage underneath the hill and where my car went over, it must have gone into the garage."
"1039"	"(12/31/63)"	"I saw a crate of apples. They were large red ones. I picked one out and asked the fellow how much it was and he said 22 cents. I was walking down a stairway. When I got down, I noticed only had on my under shorts. I felt sort of embarrassed."
"1040"	"(12/31/63)"	"I was by some neighbors'. Mike P. (deceased) came home with the groceries. He stopped by Ann and me and offered us beer. We didn't want any. We just were thru with our meal. A lady invited one of our friends to her house for some drinks. Anna and I didn't go. There seemed to be a murder, but the evidence was not found. The sheriff and a posse gathered. They had a hunch where the murderer would be if he was not murdered. I noticed the sheriff had a small gold badge. Instead of a large one."
"1041"	"(01/01/64)"	"I was in our yard at Rivertown. Someone I know, but can't recall, was using our garden hose. Brother Steve and others were kidding the hose user and he would sprinkle them with water. He tried to sprinkle me, but I stayed out of reach of the water. Then there was someone flying and they flashed a flashlight and flashed at his ray and my ray was so strong it made him blind. He stopped using it to flash at us."
"1042"	"(01/01/64)"	"I stole some money and wrapped it in a blanket. I was going to go upstairs to put on my pants and escape with it. My mother was coming over to my door. I let her in but didn't tell her what I did. A lady dressed in black was in the room. I looked at her. I got hold of her as she tried to walk away. I took off her clothes, laid her on the floor and was going to intimate her. I pressed my penis against her vagina and it wouldn't enter. I awoke."
"1043"	"(01/02/64)"	"I gave a boy $1 to go buy 5 cones of ice cream."
"1044"	"(01/02/64)"	"I looked in the paper and Lincoln was 2nd or ran 2nd. I was examined by a doctor and he said I didn't have the ailment I thought I had. He started to squeeze or pinch out blackheads from my face and a young lady also was helping him. They had my head bent down squeezing blackheads from my neck and the girl was sitting. My head was down so low I could see the girl's vagina. She had no hair. I was taking a good look at it. Then she seemed to have hair and she had it covered with hair. I was in the screw dept. in my old dept. in the flats. I was operating machines on about four lines. I had one of Bill Kotnik's acme's which was by the boss's desk. I was operating about 12 machines."
"1045"	"(01/02/64)"	"My mother took out a pistol and went outside. I heard she was going to shoot me. I got my shotgun and went out for her with my brother Steve. We found her and she had no gun now."
"1046"	"(01/03/64)"	"I was watching my brother Steve and Mary taking care of Judy. They were on the front porch in Rivertown. I was standing on the street. Mary came by with a lady friend and they were passing me without recognizing me. I spoke up and Mary then stopped and we talked. Andy P. came by in a boat which ran on the street. He was piloting it along. I was in Rivertown walking down the street and there were a lot of dogs. Then I came to a field and there were bulls. One was very big. I flew by him. Then I came by Walter Luzina. He got kind of tough with me. He was a leader of a gang. He roughed me up a little and then said, ""Now punch me. He held still and I was punching him on the chin. He would get a little dazed, but didn't drop. I must have punched him about ten times. Then something else happened. I had a knife and I'm not sure what happened, whether he tried to stab me and I took the knife from him. I think I killed him, then I broke the knife blade and I took off in flight so I wouldn't get charged for murder."
"1047"	"(01/03/64)"	"We were walking down an aisle in a church or hall and we found a seat and sat down."
"1048"	"(01/03/64)"	"We picked out a broom and the stick was broken on two occasions. Sandy was bowling and he had a broken stick. We were picking horses and couldn't decide on which one to pick."
"1049"	"(01/04/64)"	"I was watching a rat looking for food in some bushes in the daytime. Then a fellow and I took a walk thru a cave or coal mine with a light, but we didn't see any rats in there. Then later a fellow was with us and said he found a silver dollar in the mine. He had a small piece of it on his person. I had some bus tickets in my pocket and I noticed my pockets were deep and big in my coat."
"1050"	"(01/04/64)"	"I was swinging on a swing high gracefully. I looked at Judy's foot and she had very large veins over her foot."
"1051"	"(01/06/64)"	"We were about a block away from our home and someone said our house was on fire. We ran over to it and it was just lit up inside from the furnace, so we went back to where we were before. A little later someone said, ""Look at your home."" I looked and it seemed to be red hot inside. Frank Lasko as with me. We held hands and ran for our home. On the way I yelled at the people along the way to call the fire department. When we got near the house, it seemed to be red hot. The walls were. I got our garden hose and watered the walls. There was no flame, just they were red hot like a piece of charcoal when it is red hot. The dog was inside barking. He was afraid of the heat. I could feel the heat when I was inside watering the walls. They cooled off and turned back to normal color as I sprinkled them."
"1052"	"(01/06/64)"	"I was in Rivertown and the traffic was jammed. A truck and car were parked alongside one another and there was just enough space for a car to get thru and it seemed they were afraid to go thru."
"1053"	"(01/07/64)"	"I was in a stream of water. A lady was anchoring her boat. She got a push from us and it started. I hung on the back of the motor boat and she was piloting the boat up a stream. There were big waves from a fast big boat that came by and she was afraid of them. We came to a shallow part of the stream. I gave her a push when the boat was dragging or touching. Finally she got over it. I had to climb over a little bank or hill in the water and found some hooks. I threw one in and the lady near the beach said she got one in her foot yesterday. My sister Sue was talking to me or was home and I seemed to be bawling her out about lying."
"1054"	"(01/07/64)"	"We were shopping for a tricycle for Judy. She was riding one in the store and I said it was too small. She was standing and riding it. I heard a lady say they were at the track and couldn't pick a winner because it was a nice sunny day. She liked it when it was a sloppy day. I seemed to have not a winner yesterday."
"1055"	"(01/08/64)"	"I saw a fellow with two keys in a cylinder from either end and was turning the tumblers. Judy was sitting on the windowsill in just her pants and was leaning out and asleep. I picked her up and put her on the bed. Someone was opening the door. I tried to lock it, but the lock would not hold. I saw the results of one racetrack and some of the winners were horses I heard of before but I can't recall them now."
"1056"	"(01/09/64)"	"I had some pipes on the car that I took to a welder and he was going to weld them together. I had a roll of some kind of stripping."
"1057"	"(01/10/64)"	"I had some kind of small packages and there seemed to be bones in them."
"1058"	"(01/10/64)"	"I was living by my mother's house. She had a door and a stairway upstairs in the back of the house. There was a nice breeze or air thru the house. I seemed to be in Florida on several occasions. I saw or met a lot of my neighborhood fellows who were small boys when I was home by Grandma's when I was single."
"1059"	"(01/10/64)"	"Ann and I stopped on E. 55th St. and Superior and there was a couple getting married. Pauline H., a friend of mine, was taking care of or was getting married. There was a young couple in a car. They had big hook noses. They looked like brother and sister, but they were man and wife. A fellow was joking how he looked like a pig, but people should look how they look before they ridicule others."
"1060"	"(01/11/64)"	"I saw Jim the bookie. He was across the street from me on St. Clair and E. 68th St. He yelled across the street t his son to get the balance of his newspapers of his printing and sell them. Then he crossed St. Clair and I was walking towards him when he stopped by a tied dog and played with him."
"1061"	"(01/12/64)"	"I saw Steve Lasko at a distance and I waved at him. He waved back. Then Albert Lasko came over to where I was and we played some kind of a game on a board. I had a partner and so did Al. We won one game and he and his partner won a game. I was running after a young lady who was running away from me. I caught her and was loving, kissing and hugging her. Then she got away from me and I had to sneak up on her. I also was the watching party. I saw myself sneaking on a drawing. I finally got to a position by a railroad station. I saw the girl and made off I was wounded and fell to the ground and she ran up to me. I embraced her and kissed her. She got up and moved away, but came back and we embraced and kissed."
"1062"	"(01/12/64)"	"I saw a dog digging around a hole in the ground. Something happened. I can't recall not, but the hole was blown up or it caved in on the squirrels. The ground was black like coal dust. One squirrel got out of the black stuff. He was all black. He ran in flight from the dog we could see him run down the trail he usually took. I figured there was another squirrel in the black stuff. The dog grabbed a mouthful of it and I could see a squirrel wiggle in his mouth. He released it and a black squirrel dropped to the ground and started to run away, but his speed was slow because the dog hurt him when he had him in his mouth. So the dog went after him and instead of grabbing him in his mouth, he caught him by the tail with his paw and held him up."
"1063"	"(01/13/64)"	"I went to see something into a store and to my surprise it was a doctor's office. He was talking to patients of how he restored limbs for them. Then he told me he had put a pin in one of my fingers. It was stiff and he restored its flexibility. I was looking at my fingers and trying to recall the incident but couldn't."
"1064"	"(01/14/64)"	"I was going to the track with John Yakera. We met Andy P. He also was going. I had a pass and a ticket. John went in and I put my ticket on the fence and then when they were in, I took the ticket and pass and went in. The girl was looking the other way, then she called to me and I said I put my ticket in when she wasn't looking. So I showed her the pass. I said, ""We should get paid for going in instead of paying for entrance fee."""
"1065"	"(01/15/64)"	"We were getting photographed -- Ann, I, Peter, John A., my mother and some friends of ours. We were elected to political jobs. I stopped at St. Andrew's parish and I wanted to go to the washroom, but there were so many things that were washed. I couldn't find a toilet. Then I went around the other or backside. There were women and men there. The toilets were exposed. The women could see you when you sat on the toilet. I was embarrassed."
"1066"	"(01/16/64)"	"I saw some results and one was cash. But I am not sure if it was first, second or third. I went for a wiener and I picked up one of those long one foot. I broke it in half."
"1067"	"(01/17/64)"	"I met Al and he said, ""I bet you have about four winners."" He said one was Buster ? paid $70 and three others he mentioned. I couldn't understand or hear clearly. He sort of mumbled or didn't say it clearly or loud enough."
"1068"	"(01/18/64)"	"I looked into Bob's bedroom and he was sleeping and his penis was erect. We were working on some kind of object, trying to get it functioning right. I can't recall what it was. Judy did her #2 business on the floor. She had a hard time taking down her pants and she made about three piles on the floor. Trixie, our dog, almost walked over it, but I stopped her and then was ready to clean up the mess."
"1069"	"(01/19/64)"	"I said, ""United Nations 4th,"" but I think I saw it. Then I saw Peeping."
"1070"	"(01/19/64)"	"I was looking at the results. I saw Frostberg won. One sheet had Bull or some other name, but I'm almost sure it was Bull. Then it gave the name of the farm it was owned by. I can't recall the other horses I saw results on. I was in bed with one of my daughters. We were under the covers and I was intimating her. I could not penetrate her. I put some saliva on my penis and then I penetrated a little, but my daughter yelled in pain. Her husband was in the room and didn't know what I was doing. I felt a little embarrassed, so I stopped. Then Audrey asked me if I had lettuce and I said, ""Yes and I also have nice red tomatoes"". She wanted to make a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich."
"1071"	"(01/19/64)"	"I had a lunch period at work, so I went out to buy a newspaper and I heard a paper boy yelling, ""Press and news."" I asked him if the paper had the results and he said they did.  I asked him how much the paper was and he said 4 cents. I gave him a nickel and told him to keep the change and he said, ""I thought I could make some extra money today,"" so I gave him an extra 2 pennies and he said, as I was walking away, ""He is just like a woman on his tips."" I walked down the street fast and looked for a place to sit and look at the paper. I was in the shadow. The sun was shining bright that day."
"1072"	"(01/20/64)"	"I was driving my car. I drove up a muddy hill. It was steep. I got near the top. There was a car stalled there. I stopped and backed down the hill. Later I drove up the hill and went over the top."
"1073"	"(01/20/64)"	"I walked to Fairchance, PA with C. Fisher. We were painting the interior of his house. I had on a good shirt, so I took it off because I had a few spots of paint on it. I was painting a fireplace. There were a couple of holes in the wall. I reached in and pulled out a teaspoon. Then I reached into the other hole and I found some loose change. I counted the money and I had more than a dollar in change. We were by our old home in Rivertown, PA and had the paint mixed for painting of our old home. I was up on the ladder painting the peak. I reached out to one side to paint and the ladder gave or twisted and I had a hard time to pull myself back to the straight position. My sister Mary had an old bucket of paint on the ground. I told her to take it by the street curb and take out the lumps and then to mix the paint well because I would use it. I saw Bull in the paper in the entries."
"1074"	"(01/21/64)"	"I had a car that had a visible roof or top. It was like glass and I could see thru it. I walked to the corner and when I got back to where I parked my car, it was gone. Someone drove it off. I was on my way to work and was sort of puzzled what car I was to take to work in Broadway, Ohio. As I was waiting on a side street, I saw some cows walking down the street. Then behind the cows there was a bull. I don't know how he saw me, but the bull came right for me, charging. I jumped up on a freight car and the bull was after me. I then jumped very easily and flew a little in flight from the bull and he couldn't get at me. I saw pictures or movies of people when they were young and then old. You could recognize them very clearly."
"1075"	"(01/22/64)"	"I was walking along with the traffic and a policeman was also with me. I took off a part of a job finished and he would inspect it. I took off about four pieces of finished product and he inspected them. Then he said, ""Let the traffic roll on or we will bottle it up."" I looked at it as it rolled on in two lanes and the road was muddy. We looked at an old mansion. I noticed one of the small decorative small steeples was missing part of the top. Then a city official stopped on the road by the mansion. He knelt on the ground and said a prayer for the official who lived in the mansion. I thought that was a very wonderful thing for a man to do."
"1076"	"(01/23/64)"	"I looked out into a field and there were holes every so far apart where they were dug to put in valves for a gas or water line. This was prepared for a new housing project location. I saw the holes down a line all the way to some woods. There was a gang from White's. We lay down some boards and lay on them. There were hot biscuits on them cooling off. Margie, Juli, Ann and some other men from White's were there. I had one biscuit and then went away and when I got back, the biscuits were all eaten. Later we were up on a construction building looking out at something or watching for something to go by. I'm not sure what it was now, but we laid down some boards and stood on them looking out of the building. George G. got a check from a fellow and wanted to cash it, but none of his friends wanted to cash it. I spoke up for him, hinting he had a check that could be cashed to some of the big boys, but they paid no heed to me or George's check."
"1077"	"(01/23/64)"	"I was looking at a new two-story building built of rock. The rocks were about three by four feet, large ones and some were set so they stuck out like it was a bad job. It was set that way on purpose. Then there was a silo built with smaller rock. Ann gave me some money to pay a bill and I said, ""It will be about 50 cents more,"" so she gave me two quarters. A nickel dropped out of her hand and rolled on the ground by some sort of bench that ran on the side of a building. I looked for it and found a dime beside it. So I started to look around and I was picking up a lot of lost nickels. Ann gave me an extension and I used the light to look for the nickels that people lost as they take out money and a coin falls out and they don't know it has. I saw a name of a horse I can't recall now which paid $109. It started with an L like Lorance, but I'm not sure. I was in Rivertown looking at Swaney's Hill and I saw two young and two old hunters going up the hill. I heard a shot and I looked and a young hunter shot at a rabbit. The rabbit rolled, then sat up for a second and keeled over."
"1078"	"(01/24/64)"	"I saw a pile of red tomatoes. I was fixing something fitting it. I called John, the boss, to look at one of my machines. He started it and the tool jammed. The spindle stopped. He backed the tool out and it was bent. He got a bar and straightened it out. Then he told me to get a coil string. I got some wire and made a coil spring out of it. Nelson was opening up bottles of beer. He was sampling them to see if they were sour. He gave me one. I was drinking it. It was cold outside. Then the sun came out for a while and a couple came into the house with shorts on. They lounged around. I looked them over. The woman had a nice shape and the man was fairly shaped. He had a small waistline."
"1079"	"(01/26/64)"	"We were playing cards. Frank had four 7's and 2 kings in his hand. I saw moon or moons as winners."
"1080"	"(01/27/64)"	"I saw or was repeating Riverside Girl. I was picking up tomatoes and throwing them at some fellows. I was driving my car quite a lot. My brother Steve also drove it up a hill and there was a lot of snow on the road. I was operating B and S in White's."
"1081"	"(01/28/64)"	"I was working in the shop. I was starting out work from one of my machines all day. My penis got erect on me and I was surprised because it was only about three inches long and about three eighths in diameter. I made a drawing of a penis on a piece of paper and put it by my machine. Steve, the setup man, looked at it and smiled an approval. Rose J. worked with me on the job. Then Jack J. came to work with me. I told him Rose worked with me yesterday and he said, ""I know."""
"1082"	"(01/29/64)"	"I was in a kingdom. I was kind of protecting the king. I watched for any developments, then would advise the king where and what to do. There was someone coming to get the king. I went with the king thru different rooms and we eluded the trap. Then I was by St. Andrew's Parish and the fellows wanted me to play ball with them. One fellow was pointing and waving at me to come and play on his team. I changed my shoes to play ball and when I looked at the change, I had the brand new shoes on, so I had to change to old shoes."
"1083"	"(01/30/64)"	"I watched Louie Kaufman, our deceased boss at White's, go out on the roof of a building with a rifle. I watched him shoot it. I thought it was a high power rifle, but it didn't make much noise. Jerry from Dill's gave the bullets to him and it was a low velocity. There were a couple of robbers in our yard in Rivertown. I pointed my pistol at one of the bandits and he started to run in a circle. All I could see his let's go around. I shot at his legs and hit him, but he kept on running. I met an old friend of mine on St. Clair Ave. He was carrying a chicken and two loaves of frozen bread. There was paper coming loose so I took the two loaves and carried it for him. He was complaining that the farmer was keeping the chicken on a diet and it wouldn't be good to eat."
"1084"	"(01/31/64)"	"I bought something from Liddie Fosek. I gave him a $5 bill and he gave me two thin sheets of silver, a little bigger than a dollar bill and he said that each sheet was worth a dollar and I would not have any trouble passing it. Later I had it bunched up together. I got close to the wall and looked to see if it lined up with the wall on the other end. I was on the 6th floor of the White's building in the flats. I looked down the sidewalk and it was high. I looked twice. I said, ""If you would jump down, you would kill yourself."" I was working in Dill's and John Sereno, the boss looked at two clocks on the wall and said, pointing to one of them, ""This one is the right time."" I looked at the sky and the air was polluted with smoke and bad odors. I had a carrot. I was washing it off. It was kind of soft, which meant it was old. There was a pile of carrots near me. I was tempted to take one, but it would be stealing."
"1085"	"(02/01/64)"	"I saw Joy Fling as an also ran."
"1086"	"(02/02/64)"	"I was in some kind of trouble with some colored people. A couple of colored men did something to a train, some damage or then ran it without permission. I saw them doing it so I was going to call the police and they knew I was. So I started to run, then fly in flight. I flew over the colored neighborhood. Some young colored boys saw me and tried to catch me, but I stayed out of their reach. The wind started to blow and I had a hard time flying against. it."
"1087"	"(02/02/64)"	"I walked down a railroad track with a tire tube. I had a flashlight. It was night and dark. I saw the headlight of an engine coming down the track. I got off the track and poured some gasoline on the tube, then put the valve stem submerged in it so the gas would enter into the tube. The engine was near now, so I told my friends to hold their heads down as it passed and we would not be seen. I was with Kenny and Steve K. from Dill's. We were trying to put on a big cover on a ball like which was about three feet in diameter, but had a hard time getting it on so it would cover the ball like a cover that is on a baseball. Then we had Steve to act as the ball and we tried to cover him like we would a ball, but it wouldn't work. Then we were talking of doing chin-ups. We had clothesline ropes strung across. I said that was too weak to hold us up. There was an alligator and a cat or turtle. I'm not sure now. The alligator jumped up and he went up like a rocket, then came down. The turtle also went face on the ground and the alligator chased him, then jumped on the turtle's back. The turtle went up a tree fast, then made a quick stop, which made the alligator fall off going up the tree."
"1088"	"(02/02/64)"	"Someone knocked on the side door. I answered it and a man was there. He started to talk about horses and I didn't want my wife to hear, so I said, ""Get away from here."" He was saying or naming horses, giving the odds and the date, then it dawned on me, so I said, ""Come here,"" and I looked behind the door and it was a woman now and I remember shoot or shot was one of the horses, so I asked her what was the name of the horse and what was the odds. But she wouldn't answer the question because I would not listen to her before."
"1089"	"(02/03/64)"	"I saw Battle of Rocks as a winner."
"1090"	"(02/03/64)"	"I saw 33."
"1091"	"(02/04/64)"	"I won two doubles. One was a 8-5 and the other was 6 and 4 or 5. The 8-5 paid $95. I was paid in cash from St. Charles' church. I saw the double in the paper. A Bob in the first face and a Bruce in the second race. I'm not so sure of the names, but I have a vague picture it was that. I was going to school and I was going to look at the entries, but had someone around and was not in the mood to look. I saw George G. He had baloney for lunch. Louie Kaufman came by and took a piece of the baloney and ate it."
"1092"	"(02/05/64)"	"We were peeping out the window at night and saw a prowler hiding and running from one place of concealment to another as we watched. Then he came to our door and he was a friend of my friend who was with me in the house."
"1093"	"(02/06/64)"	"I was looking at my parked car and I saw my front right brake and the car dropped on one side, then the rear spring broke and then all four springs and then the car seemed to fold up on a heap of scrap metal."
