    "description": "\"Merri Anderson\" is an artist in her late 30s who began writing her dreams down in 1999, sometimes using them as a basis for some of her paintings. However, another main impetus for starting a dream journal was the appearance in her dreams of her sister, older by nearly two years, who had been killed in January, 1996.  (She died on life support with Merri and their brother Rudy -- younger than Merri by four years -- at her side.) This sister, Dora, a well-educated, successful professional greatly admired by Merri, is the most frequent character in her dreams.  The series is notable for how revealing it is concerning her conceptions and concerns in relation to her family members and friends. The concern with color and art work of various kinds is also striking.  (For further information on Merri's series, including a cast of characters, click here.)"
