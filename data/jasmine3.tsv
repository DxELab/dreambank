"C-001"	"#C-001 (2003-05-27 (18)) I'm still having crazy dreams about the undead, from reading that Dracula book. The concept is supposed to be so scary and so horrible, which it kind of is, but it's more cool than anything, you know what I mean? So last night I dreamt that Sandra like came to me in my sleep and like laid down next to me, and somehow I had the notion that she was undead and she was like visiting me. And she wasn't going to, she didn't scare me, she wasn't going to take any of my blood, but I was going to like give her some so that she could like come back to life or something dumb like that. [laugh] And that's all that there is to it. I kind of faded into consciousness."
"C-002"	"#C-002 (2003-05-31 (18)) First of all, there were like several things to it. First of all I dreamt that I got several birthday presents, at this time of the year -- yes, birthday presents! Maybe because Terri gave me a late birthday card or something. One of them was this mechanical baby doll that like it was the form and the stature of a real person, of a full-grown person, but it acted like a baby doll. Its arms like would reach out to you and it would laugh and say, ""Mama"" and stuff like that. And if it was turned on, it would just do that periodically at any time. And Dad was like, ""That thing! How are you ever going to get any sleep?"" But he didn't realize that all you had to do is turn it off and it wouldn't do that any more. And I thought it was a really special gift from somebody, I don't remember who. Then I dreamt that I was studying media in college and I needed something to help me study it, and Dad and I went to this electronics store to get one and the one, the Peavey one that we were looking at was really, really good. It was kind of a mixer and bat kind of combined into one unit. And then there was this other one that was even better [laugh] and this was the funniest part. The Peavey one that we were looking at spanned three octaves, but this other one spanned like six octaves, and so Dad wanted me to have the Peavey one, but he wanted the store person to cut the other one in half and attach the half to the Peavey one and make it one unit. [laugh] I don't get that! And the store owner said, ""Well, there's a much easier solution. We have a larger Peavey model."" And so we ended up getting the larger Peavey model. And then I dreamt that I was working for the baseball team, and not like a DJ but to do like paperwork and stuff. And I had a desk in their offices, and somehow -- I don't remember how -- but I must've put it on my desk. And there was this other girl who had a desk next to me who was studying video and stuff also, and we decided we were going to like hear it, and then I can't remember, but I was off running errands for them or something, and I come back and somehow somebody had talked me into just giving it to her, and getting another one with my gift card, and so I had this nice, perfect model and when I got back to my desk it wasn't there. And then I like rolled around or something like that and then I woke up. And then I was like half conscious, but having other little tiddly dreams but keeping that thought in mind that, I don't know. Then I woke up. I have a little bit more of an explanation about the baby doll part of this dream, now that I've been thinking about it. When I was little, I had two kind of small talking baby dolls. One was supposed to be a boy and one was supposed to be a girl. One was from Brittany and Roxanne and one was from Aunt Peggy. And they would laugh and they would say, ""Mama,"" but they wouldn't like reach out to you or anything. And I think, oh, I know what, when their batteries kind of ran down, they talked like this [low stretched-out voice] and they sounded like an old man, kind of like my tape sometimes. And that was just so weird. [laugh] I think I might have been thinking about that."
"C-003"	"#C-003 (2003-06-02 (18)) I was at this youth center place, kind of like Club Saturday, but they were having this like workshop thing and I can't remember exactly what it was. But I was in this room, like a dance studio, and Samantha and me and Mom and this strange instructor person were in there, and they were showing me a trumpet, of all things [laugh] and they wanted me to just try it out and see how it felt. And I could feel the finger things and I remembered when -- I don't know -- it was just weird. [laugh] And then we went out to this main like cafeteria area and there was a, it was empty and there was a piano in there and some girl was like playing. And I was like walking through there to get out to the door to go out, and the instructor person who was with us gave me this little book, thumbnail size book of songs. And then when I got out to the car, Dad and somebody else were there to pick us up, but I realized that I left my MD machine in the room, so I had to get out and run back in. By this time the cafeteria was full of people, and noisy students. So I went back and got my machine and then I went, then we went to this like funeral thing, I guess for like James's father, and I was kind of perplexed because we said we weren't going to go. And somehow I got separated from everybody else and I was like sitting behind the first row and I was watching the thing going on. Then when it ended, everybody kind of got up and left and I was like left in there. And I got up and I started walking. There was this big, long and there was this big complex at the funeral center, and as I got up and I started walking, there was like this bridge over the pool, and so I walked over that and I started to cross the front lawn. And then this lady came out and stopped me and said that this path was going to lead me into private property because there were condos over there. And she was going to lead me like back to the parking lot. And so she led me to this path that had these sprinkler heads sticking up that you could trip over at any minute, and we were walking along this path and suddenly they came on and sprayed all over us. And then we got to this like little clearing area deep in the woods and somehow Mom found us and found out where I was and went back to the car and told everybody. And I don't remember ever getting back there. I woke up before I got back."
"C-004"	"#C-004 (2003-06-04 (18)) We had taken a car trip up to California to see Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird -- you'd never believe it. Dad said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can't remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don't remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that -- oh, I know -- somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Uncle Charlie and Uncle Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Uncle Charlie how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them like came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door. And we were set off to drive all the way back home, and then I woke up."
"C-005"	"#C-005 (2003-06-06 (18)) For whatever reason, Mom was waiting for an ambulance to come and get her, but yet in the meantime she was going to take a walk with me. Now doesn't that sound weird? And so we went and we walked over to this like kids' playground thing and then -- this is all kind of like mixed up in my memory -- so we were at this playground thing that was all built out of wood and it was like kind of a maze thing, and they had all kinds of neat things. But I couldn't find any of them to show her. And somehow I dreamt that I had the notion that I was at school and time to get out so that I could get to the parking lot where they were going to pick me up. Well, at school the halls were like flooding and they had water up to my ankles, and I took my shoes off so that they wouldn't get all wet, but from taking off my shoes I couldn't keep my balance as well, and there wasn't much more to it."
"C-006"	"#C-006 (2003-06-08 (18)) I was at Camp Airport getting ready to go to Spain, and I had my bags and stuff and I was walking around and walking around thinking, and then I realized that I didn't know what city I was laying over in and I didn't know what time the flight was leaving, and I didn't know any kind of information. So I sat down on this railing to this stairwell and I was taking stuff out of my purse that I didn't need, like this vitamin bottle with one vitamin in it and these papers and stuff, and I called Mom on the cell phone and she couldn't really tell me a lot. And she was there like within two or three minutes of me calling, and she was saying that I should try to meet up with Mrs. Hollander's group but I didn't know where they were, and I think they had left already. And so, as it turned out, it was like late at night and there was nobody around to help me out, and they shut off the lights for the stairwell and I like started freaking out. And I just decided I wasn't going to go, and I like ripped my ticket and I got my bags, and I was ready to go home. And then I woke up."
"C-007"	"#C-007 (2003-06-14 (18)) I was setting up the Peavey system in the back yard because we were going to have some kind of Father's Day party, and I said I was going to test it out. So I played ""Pink"" and Dad kind of left. And Mom and Dad were sitting on the picnic table, but Dad left because he didn't know _________ for the song that ________ was in, and then while he was gone we thought he just left because he didn't want to be at the party. So we continued with the party. Nobody else came over, but we had kind of a party ourselves, but it was in the middle of the day, and I don't know why I would do a party in the middle of the hottest part of the day outside. And then I dreamt that I was at this like class in this portable classroom, and they were doing this stuff and somebody was telling this story about how, if you were in the military and then you leave, you wear your armor home and then you take it off, and then it jumps under your skin and you can never get ride of it, essentially a symbolistic thing. And that was kind of odd."
"C-008"	"#C-008 (2003-06-17 (18)) I don't know how much tape I have left. I know it's going to shut off in the middle of this, but I guess I'll at least try. I haven't had a dream like this in quite a while, so I guess I'm not going cuckoo. Okay, last night I dreamt that Mom and I were coming home from somewhere and it was kind of late at night, but then again I had the notion that it was in the afternoon. And she, I was kind of laying on the bed when we got home, and Mom got this big box from her room and I was laying down, almost asleep, so I couldn't see it. But I could hear her taking something out of the box, and she said she got me an early present and she couldn't resist showing it to me. It was supposedly a keyboard that spans like five octaves. And she plugged it in and she started playing me a song, and, you know, she was good! I can't remember what it was, but she was good. And then she played me a second song and for some reason I didn't clap and go ""Whoo!"" or anything. I was just laying there half asleep. [laugh] And I didn't realize it until she had put it back in the box and then it was like all kinds of stuff on the bed, like rollers and shampoo and clothes and bags and purses, and I like knew that's on the bed. I wanted to see how big the box was. And I realized, I was like, ""Wow!"" So she was going to [laugh] put the box like up in her work room. And then, for whatever reason, she decided [end of tape] ...."
"C-009"	"#C-009 (2003-06-23 (18)) The beginning of a new tape, obviously! [she sings!] Oh well, that's dumb. [laugh] I had a dumb dream last night that I had just graduated from high school, and for whatever reason all of the teachers wanted to have all of us back for ten more days, and especially Ms. Marcos. She had, I can't remember, I think it was something like the fact that the state mandated that shove a couple more lessons down our throats and she didn't get to it. And in order to cover her hide, we had to go back ten days after we graduated and get a little more. And then Mr. Jameson decided he was going to do that too. And I had to go to the Wa______ and I was trying to figure how to get all this in at once. And it was kind of weird. I can't remember much of what happened, but the gym was like this big open, dark area and it just was different. And I woke up and I realized it was only a dream, and I was so grateful. But then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was in a dollar store with this little boy, and I had to buy certain things. And I was buying these gummy dinosaurs, and I like took a handful of them and I took them up to the counter and I paid 10 cents each, and then I woke up."
"C-010"	"#C-010 (2003-06-25 (18)) I was at school again and after class -- it was like the last day before break -- and after class I went to this ______ restaurant called Ceasar's Pizza with Linda and some other people and there was this band there and they were all like singing and having a good time. And we each got one of these little pizza things where you rip off a piece of crust and you scoop some stuff, and that's how you're supposed to eat it. Well, I finished that and then Dad came to take me home and it was flooded. I mean, we were practically swimming through the parking lot; the water was up to our chest. And in some cars there was water like halfway up the doors, but with ours somehow we were in a lower area, it was like only a little bit up to the tires, I guess. And [laugh] the funny thing was, he started backing out and maneuvering out with the door hanging wide open, and he said that he was going to honk real loud to make sure he got all the way out of the radiator, which I don't understand. [laugh] And I don't remember much more; I think that was it and then I woke up."
"C-011"	"#C-011 (2003-07-01 (18)) I don't remember how we got there or anything, but I dreamt that there was this fair thing, and we were visiting this small community with somebody we know, but I can't remember, I can't put my finger on who. And, you know, like they had relay races and stuff -- well, this was kind of an odd type of a relay race thing that a family could do. What it was, was when there's a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don't know where we would get that from. I didn't remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, ""Oh, how neat!"" Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC 110 to DC 12, and once it was in DC 12 mode, 12 volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else. And we were going to play a CD or something, or watch a movie, I don't remember what. But I think I was going to do it out while the storm was brewing and banging outside, and I don't remember exactly all the details; it's kind of foggy now. But that's what it was. And then I woke up."
"C-012"	"#C-012 (2003-07-02 (18)) Dad and I and Mom were at the park and he found this book that he wanted to read to us. Lo and behold it was this, I had made up a story in my head in a dream that was kind of in this book, if you know what I'm saying. And what it was, was a story about a lotus blossom, and it was this leaf that died and in the next life turned into a little branch, which died and then in the next life turned into a flower and then a bigger branch, and then finally a tree. And it was talking about the venerable tree and how there's different trees in different countries, and how respected they should be. And then in the very last part, a bird lands on this tree and the bird becomes the friend of the tree. And then after we read this book, we went home and I don't remember, but something, I was in the tub and it was going, ""Fwaaaaab!"" I don't remember too much more."
"C-013"	"#C-013 (2003-07-03 (18)) I had an assistant. It wasn't really a hired assistant, but another student helping me. And I was back at Westport High School, or Westport College -- I couldn't figure out which one it was. And she was helping me find my room numbers for next year's classes. I think it was Latisha from the Wilcox Center. And she was showing me where my psychology class is, but she said that if I go too far to one side, past the psychology class, I would be in the Special Ed Department and there were all kinds of whackos in there that I didn't want to be around. And so she advised me to go around one way to get to the other thing. And then we met up with Samantha and Derek, who had driven down, I guess, and Latisha kind of turned me over to them and went about her away. And Samantha and Derek and I were trying to find an elevator to get down and we found one. We got down and out to this like pool area, and it looked like the pool was outside, but I guess it really wasn't, because it was an echoey echo chamber around there. And I can't remember if I wanted to get in and swim or not, but I remember that it was an echoey echo chamber. And Derek went in there started walking around and around the perimeter of the pool, saying, ""It collapsed, it collapsed, it collapsed! The World Trade Center collapsed!"" And this was kind of upsetting Samantha, but she didn't want to show it. [laugh] I mean, this is totally off the wall, but that's what he did in my dream. And then we got back in the car for some reason, and we were going to go home, and Samantha was like laying in my lap and crying. She was like the size of me and I could like support her, and her legs were like falling on the floor. I could support her body. And she had dark hair like me. And, but I knew she wasn't me; she was Samantha. And then we kept driving, and then Derek was talking about next time maybe that Mom can run him down. And about that time I woke up."
"C-014"	"#C-014 (2003-07-04 (18)) I didn't remember it very clearly this morning, but as the day went on, it became clearer. That is very unusual because most of the time it works the other way around. First I dreamt that me and Astrid were like playing with toys, like we were kids. We were winding up all of our dolls and our animals and things and we were making a parade the way I used to do when I was little. And she was listening to like a personal CD player. And she was lining up some baby dolls and stuff. And her mother came back and told us we should totally stop that because that's immature; that's like kids' behavior. And then I woke up. And then I went back to sleep and I had another dream that Samantha and Derek were in town and Derek was using this audio program that's different from Digital Performer, but it was kind of similar. Mom had her own machine just like mine in her work room and her monitor was up on her high boy dresser. And I was like kneeling up on the stool, so that I could see it, and Derek had composed this rap thing with MIDI, and I was going to like go over it and sing some melody, like Ashanti sings for Javol (?) and Beyonce sang for JV (?). I was going to do that for Derek and his rap. I was like trying to do this and it like wasn't working right, and I had to close out and shut down, but I woke up before I could do it."
"C-015"	"#C-015 (2003-07-05 (18)) This was the night that Astrid slept over. I had _____________ what am I talking about? And I dreamt that something was going on in my studio while Astrid was sleeping and Mom was in her work room doing something. And I was doing something in my studio, like the sound, and I guess I kind of got turned on. And I don't know how -- she didn't see me -- but I think Mom found out, and she was telling me, ""It's too rough over there; why don't you do that in bed, because Astrid's blind and she won't be able to even see you."" And [laugh] I'm glad I woke up. That was just so ridiculous! [laugh]"
"C-016"	"#C-016 (2003-07-06 (18)) I can't remember what we were doing, but we were going to have some kind of party at the house. And the, we had to have the amplifier receiver in the freezer. We had to have it centrally located there in order for it to work right, and it wasn't big like big and bulky; it was small, it was the size of the microphone bass thing. And I think there was this singing group that was coming to the house, and again Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town. And they were going to have like a party on the porch. And we had like an outside system set up on the porch, and I couldn't, we couldn't get the sound system to work right, so Mom was working feverishly putting the food together and I was like opening the freezer door and messing with the receiver. I changed the selector from A to B so that it would be on the outside system on the porch, and meanwhile while I'm trying to do this to get it to work right, Mom's like yelling to me that she needs me to help her with the food, and she's like taking my trip and almost tripping me. And I told her I can't do that now, I've got to do this, and I think she finally got the picture. And I finally got it to work right for them, and [laugh] it took me a little while to understand which CD they wanted cued up because to me they all sounded the same, by this singing group that was kind of a bland version of the Spice Girls. And, let's see, I think -- oh, that's it."
"C-017"	"#C-017 (2003-07-11 (18)) I was back at Westport High School and I was in the Media Center where there's three stories. And to get to from one to two wasn't hard, it was normal. But from two to get to three, I guess two was like extra tall and three was like up near the ceiling. You had to climb this monumental amount of stairs. And when we would ride the elevator to get to one, to two wouldn't be too bad; that would be normal. But to get to three, it would take forever and a day, and sometimes it wouldn't even go up to three or wouldn't work right. And we'd be nervous about getting stuck. So I would just prefer to climb the monumental amount of stairs and work up there slowly but surely, dragging my book bag and everything. I remember doing that once, and then going kind of down an incline to get to the main building, and then I think there was a cat walk between that building and somewhere else. And I had to go down to get something. I had to talk to Ms. Garland or somebody, so I took the elevator down and then came back up. But then I dreamt that we were at this like little park thing that you could go out and be in. There were swans and ducks and pigs and things, and it was like a manmade park, but these birds just lived in there. And we would feed them and stuff. And they did these like shows, but I never got to see any of them. And I don't remember anything more. Oh, and I remember the swans were real aggressive. They would come down and lick people, and then I don't remember any more."
"C-018"	"#C-018 (2003-07-15 (18)) I was back at this place that was kind of, it kind of reminded me of like the Wilcox Center auditorium except it had a stage, and the room was kind of dark except for some stage lighting that was kind of bluish and a yellowish-whitish spotlight kind of in the middle of the room. And there was like a dance party going on, except the sound system was kind of low and it wasn't really all that loud. But there was cluddy techno going on, and I was with Astrid and Linda and there were some families and parents and things there. And there were some like bleacher seats, as though we were at the Eastport Bayfront Center or something like that. But there was this big open foyer for us to dance around and then there was a stage. And I would be like, I would meet Astrid and Linda around, and then I would leave them with some other people and then I would go mingle around with some other people and then I was going to just dance. And they kind of toned it down a little and they were getting ready to do this show. And what it consisted of was this animal trainer person who was there, and had an alligator that was like almost twice the size of a chichahua dog and he was on a leash and they were walking him around the stage. And all of us people from the Wilcox Center had to line up and walk up on stage and go by and pet the alligator and say something to it. [laugh] This is getting so bizarre! And then everybody was suddenly dressed like so nice. Somebody was in this like blue jacket and this black dress and everybody else was in like black dresses, and I couldn't figure out where I was going to be in line and I like wasn't even going to do this show thing. And Randy's yelling at me from the back of the room, ""Jasmine, go to the back of the room."" And then some other volunteers kind of helped me find my place. And before I could get up to the stage to the alligator, I kind of faded into another scene. I was in my studio and Terri was over working on my machine. And I had two monitors because what were supposed to be able to do is work from the PC and the Mac at the same time with the same mouse, but two keyboards and two monitors. And I can't remember what I was doing, but I was doing some kind of a script or something for that show. I was doing the audio and DP and the typing in Word all at once, and Terri was helping me. And then I just faded into consciousness."
"C-019"	"#C-019 (2003-07-19 (18)) I was already starting college and it was my first day of classes. And I was heading to my psychology class in the Social Arts Building and in my dream it was a lot shorter. It was almost a portable almost. And I was trying to, well, first of all before any of this, the DART cab was coming to pick me up, and I had to run back to the house to get something and I was carrying my Wilcox Center bag in my other hand, and it was so heavy, and I kept tripping and falling and tripping and falling. When I finally got back to the house I asked Mom for some money so I could pay the guy and she gave me some. And then I was there and the security guard stopped me and was talking and talking and I was late for class, and I went up to this portable that was supposedly the Social Arts Building and there was like this little doggie door that was like the first door that I could get in. And I like opened and it and it went, ""Squeak"" real loud and then I just closed it and I stood outside. And when the teacher came out a regular door, and he was like, ""Come on in and sit down. This is the first day, and I've had a lot of people late today. Just come in and sat down."" And so I did. And there was this assistant that was sitting by me, like Melinda would, and this assistant kind of reminded me of Randy. The teacher and the assistant kind of seemed to be doubles of each other, and doubles of this stranger person that was kind of like Randy. And they were talking about these chant songs and these songs with these sounds and these words in them, and the words were like all jumbled and we had to kind of make something of them. And there was this one that was like, ""Leah, Leah, __________"" -- they kept screaming that name, and other students in the class were talking about how in that culture that Leah was a higher spirit, a higher power that they were chasing. And the teacher passed out a packet of papers, it was like a booklet of these different words and what they meant, and his assistant was prodding me to go over to a CC TV and look at it and read what it says, so I could ______ with the rest of them. And I was kind of feeling like I shouldn't bother because I could always look at it at home and I should just listen now. And then I kind of started to fade into consciousness, and I realized, ""Hey, this is only a dream. It's only July 18th or 19th. I don't have to study yet."" And that's when I kind of went back to sleep and faded into the dark."

I can't remember any kind of details, but there was a regular school bus that was going to take me home with a bunch of other people, and this meeting kept me talking and talking, and I missed the bus, so I had to call Mom and Dad and they came and they picked me up. But before they got here, I think I had to go back through the school and back into the courtyard and around because I forgot something, and then I came and I can't remember any more.

And I dreamt that starting the class we were going to start in a regular classroom and do a little bit of study on theory. And I don't remember too much except there were these things that some black girl copied off the board for me, and I could hardly read her handwriting, but I did recognize this formula that was kind of weird, and I couldn't put my finger on it right at the moment, but then I thought about it and I decided that that formula was the formula for finding the frequency of a note. And then I think -- I can't remember what we were doing -- everybody was kind of at a place that had a regular desk and then some other stuff. And for whatever reason, right at that moment I was out of class and I was setting up the Peavey system in this big open foyer because somebody was going to have a wedding or a party or some kind of a reception. And I turned it on kind of low, I thought it sounded from behind, but I guess from the front it was a little louder. Up in the balcony there was this guy that was yelling at me to turn it down some. And while I was like on the floor in this big open wooden floor, huge area rug room and there was these balconies all around, I guess kind of like the rotunda at the Dome except it was square and it had a wooden floor, but the acoustics were the same. And then, once it was on and I was kind of playing some easy listening stuff, I got word that the party had been like postponed for an hour or so, so I shut everything down and I was back with the class and we were going up this set of stairs to this band room. We weren't really in a line, we weren't going in any kind of order. We were just clumsily traipsing up the stairs. And this lady -- Irene Doppley or something like that -- I don't know who she was, but she pulled me aside and she gave me this present. And I was home in my studio and I opened it, and it was this inline amplifier that's supposed to make a signal from a microphone or instrument stronger with a little bit of effect before it goes like to a main house system. And it was like a little bigger than this tape machine. So that was really bizarre. [laugh]"
"C-022"	"#C-022 (2003-07-27 (18)) I was in college again, but they were treating us like babies. There was this one woman teacher who had maybe fifteen or twenty of us that she had to take around to a various number of classes and we had all our classes together. And we had six periods a day, just like in high school. And fifth and sixth period we could go to by ourselves, but first through fourth we had to follow behind her in a line and she would leave us with these teachers and then come and check back with us. I think that was kind of a development from the Wilcox Center. This one class was supposed to be -- I can't remember why -- but in my dream I couldn't really stand up right. I had weak muscles and I kept wanting to let my head just drop to in front of my chest, and I couldn't hold my shoulders up straight. And the teacher dropped us off. We were in this big foyer, kind of like the Wilcox Center auditorium, and this professor was, I think it was Dr. Stephenson from Westport College, and he was leading this chorus of people a little young than me singing, ""_____________"" and so on and I wanted to go and join with them, so I came to the front of the line and the front of the like block of people and I stood. And again, I was having trouble holding myself up straight, and that one teacher kept coming over to me and tipping my head up and like straightening my shoulders and I just could not hold them up straight. Then, as we were singing and breathing and learning the song, the floor became more bouncing and more trampoline-y and more like a mattress, and it got bouncier and bouncier, the more we did. It became kind of like a moon walk thing almost, but it still looked the same. And when I tried to stand the way you're supposed to stand when your stand -- feet next to each other, everything in alignment -- I just could not stand; I would keep falling down. So I had to stand with one foot in front and one foot in back a little ways. Then I could sort of stay up for a little longer, but I would still fall down. And I don't remember too much more."
"C-023"	"#C-023 (2003-07-28 (18)) I was watching something on TV that was Celine Dion celebrating her birthday in France on a beach. And she was like jumping around and dancing and singing this like club and techno song about ""I got my suntan and I got my ________, I got my this and I got my that,"" and part of it was in French, I guess. The next thing I knew this person came to the house, and I realized it was her and she was kind of short and kind of fat and she had short, dark hair. And she was wearing this tee shirt with like writing and stuff all over it. And she was kind of blah, she was kind of sarcastic like Terri is. And I would say things like how great it was to meet her, and how this is so exciting, and she would just laugh and kind of like ""Everybody says that."" And then we had a slow dance together, and I just couldn't stop crying because I was so touched. She did actually say something nice through her sarcasm, I can't remember what it was. But I was just so touched, and I don't remember anything else. ... in my album there was this line that goes, ""I can't believe it ___________ to me"" [singing] -- and part of it was a little flat and a little off key, so I figured I would highlight that area and try to transpose it and try to fine tune it by maybe 30 cents or something like that. Well [laugh] somehow it kinda got all whacked out and it just went totally off the wall, and then it sounded like [singing again] , ""Oh, I can't believe __________"" and it sounded like a tape that was wearing out. It was the funniest thing. [laugh]"
"C-024"	"#C-024 (2003-07-31 (18)) We were having some kind of party in the living room and that there was some kind of difficulty going on. I think we were going to watch a movie and have the sound system on, and the VCR wasn't working or something, and there was some kind of commotion about somebody dropped a glass of water. It was very vague. And then, since the VCR wasn't working and we couldn't watch the movie, then I decided I was going to set up the mixer board and stuff, and I like, I think I dropped a glass tube of some kind and it shattered all over the floor. And then I could finally sit down and eat the taco thing, and I don't remember too much else. That was dumb."
"C-025"	"#C-025 (2003-08-02 (18)) I was going on a date with Doug to a baseball game, and the thing was, Doug worked at a restaurant near the Dome, so he could just stay at the baseball game and watch. But I, with the sound things, and I was going to kind of show him what I did, but we ended up eating lunch at this restaurant there and it was like a walk-through buffet like pizzeria thing. And you would go through and you would get some pizza and you'd get some other finger foods, and then you'd go in this ____________ for your drink. Well, I think for a minute Doug turned into Dad and he got me this like sushi soup type of stuff, and I was ""Yuk"" when I had my eyes on some pizza or some chicken fingers or something like that, and I didn't even have time to get a drink. So then we walked down a ramp that led like right into the baseball field, and ___________ and somehow I finished my yuk soup. And then I drift into another scene and I'm walking along with Dad, and I'm up on the second floor where I do my DJ stuff at Gate One. And it's dark, and it's like in the middle of the night and there are only a few lights on in there. And there's a spotlight like from the ceiling shining down to the first _____ like right in front of where I would work. And the floor up on the balcony is like _____ in linoleum instead of carpet, and it was kind of strange. I was thinking, ""Man, do I have to set up in this total darkness?"" And it wasn't really a scary darkness, because darkness isn't scary; it's just a wide open like familiar space. I'm comfortable in the dark. And then I think all the offices were dark and locked up. And then there was -- I don't remember -- going somewhere out to the truck, and then I woke up."
"C-026"	"#C-026 (2003-08-03 (18)) Well, it's not really goofy, but still.... I dreamt that I was back in Westport High School again, and I was there like on an extra day, an extra day like after school had ended or something. And I was at this luncheon with the Spanish Honor Society people. Can't remember what I was doing with them, but I was just having lunch, I think going to MacDonalds or something. Then I came back to the school and was helping out with the awards ceremony, and then we were out in the bus lane waiting for this city charter bus to come and pick us up and take us all home, kind of like when we were at the Wilcox Center waiting for our cabs. So we were all at this bus lane, this girl named Astrid was showing me her award and telling me about various things, and then the city bus comes and I get right in front for some reason, and it's going to take us all home just like a school bus would, except it's not. All of a sudden the cell phone rings and it's Mom and Dad wanting to know why it's 4:00 o'clock and we're not home yet, and I told them all the things I've been doing and it's impolite to make a call on the cell phone during the assembly. And so, of course, that didn't go over too well. So I got home and sitting at the dining table and Dad's asking me to explain why I didn't call sooner and all. And I'm sitting there and I'm at this placemat thing that ______ for papers and we ran out of them, sitting there typing with my fingers as though there were a keyboard there, but there wasn't, just a placemat. I'm sitting there typing away, but there's like nothing [laugh] . That was dumb. And Dad comes over and he's like, ""I'm sorry, I can't read that draft."" And so then I get the drift, and I start writing it all down. And before I can finish, I woke up."

They were kind of frowned upon like artificial or fake. So and one of the _____ really accept the fact that this was necessary. And they had the doctor come up and prove that she couldn't really do it the right way, and then they would let her use a key-based knee (?) type of thing. And there was this one particular type of drum set that you had to lay down on the floor and like kick your feet and use your hands in order to do them. Oh my gosh [loud noise on tape] , in my dream she was like 70 years old and couldn't even try to do that. That was odd."
"C-028"	"#C-028 (2003-08-06 (18)) Linda was wanting to come over for 4th of July and go down to the street dance type thing with us on the weekend and enjoy the dance and things at midnight. She wanted to be sitting down in my studio remembering all of our people overseas. And then I realized that it was something like July 10th or 11th and that 4th of July was last weekend. And then I kind of found out that Linda and her family had kind of hired the downtown, the band and everybody to have another 4th of July party and act like it was 4th of July. And so I was there with her, and I don't remember too much. But we were walking around and listening to the band. I dreamt that it was a beefed up version of my Peavey system and I hired somebody to work the board so I could walk around with her. And what else? I also dreamt that I was going into -- I had this teddy bear that was like a s_____ teddy bear, and he had a lavalier microphone attached to a long wire, and it was kind of like, kind of attached in some way. And I wanted to replace it, and I also, I can't remember what else, but I went in and I took care, I wanted an adaptor, so I ran and I took care of that. Then I realized I didn't have my purse or anything with me, so I ran back out to the truck, and, of course, running is like barely even walking in a dream. And then I woke up before I could do anything."
"C-029"	"#C-029 (2003-08-10 (18)) First of all, I was back home and I was back at Westport High School, but then again I had the feeling that I really wasn't supposed to be there, but I had the feeling that it was extra. And Mr. Jameson, my boring PE teacher, was having me do this report, and in the locker room there were these little match books with people's names and numbers on them, like famous people. And he would give you a number of a person he would want you to do a report on, and you would go to these match books in the locker room and find the correct number of the person, and _____ the match book with some references that you go to, I guess. And he was going to give me this person to do that was #42, but he wanted me to wait and come back the next day and ask him what number it was. And so the next day I slept in until 9:45, and I had to skip school in order to give this gift back to the radio station and I had gotten some gifts from somebody in my dream that was like a little address book that I couldn't really see that well, and some pencils and some other little diddly things, and I was going to put it in a basket and donate to the radio station, I guess, to sell in a fundraiser or something, or like a _____ gift, I guess. I was going to skip school so that I could go do that. Well, I was laying in bed listening to Lionel Richie on the bedroom machine, and Cooper, Aunt Christine's big dog, was there, and I was ______ I was laying with him and I was holding onto him like he was a person, and he was like laying his head on my shoulder and like kind of licking my ear or something.

"C-030"	"#C-030 (2003-08-13 (18)) I was back home again, and I was on my s_____ upstairs and we had somehow I was getting to have all these tons of things on my hard drive, and I needed the space for audio and I didn't know how these things were getting on there. And I, you know how sales people call sometimes and they solicit their marketing and stuff? Well, this girl called the house and she was selling things, and I started asking her a bunch of questions about things and she didn't really know the Mac platform that well, but she knew about things ____ and I thought that maybe the fact that the beautiful angel statue's wing cracked off, I thought that maybe that was screwing up my system somehow. [laugh] And I told her that, and, of course, she probably thought I was crazy. And she decided she was going to come over to the house to see what I was talking about, and to help me out, and then I kind of, I went online somewhere, which is something I can't do, and I was trying to download some kind of audio or something, but instead this green dinosaur was getting downloaded and opened and all, and I couldn't close it. I couldn't do anything. I had to do a restart to get out of that. And I couldn't even do that. [laugh] And then she came over and she was like hanging out in the house for two days, not really doing much. And then I can't remember, I think we fixed my angel statue, and then her supervisor came, and he was a real nice man that actually knew what he was talking about, and he helped me delete all these things and I was telling him, ""Okay, let's shut down the right way this time."" And he said, ""Okay, I'll do it with the keys."" And he actually did it the way you do it for Windows, and I was starting checking on, I was, I guess I wasn't sure what operating system I was using. And he did the Windows key, the ____ and the _____ just like they taught me at the Wilcox Center. And I think there's more to it, but I woke up. I think this came from watching Bobby, how his setup is a little more different than ours, and he knew all these games and stuff. I guess that's what I'm thinking of. "
"C-031"	"#C-031 (2003-08-14 (18)) I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night because Mom wasn't there; she was out with Uncle Larry. But people were still fussing around. Aunt Christine was at the kitchen table, putting packing tape and newspapers in a box, so you can imagine what that sounded like. And then there was all kinds of other stuff going on. And while all that was going on, I kind of fell asleep for maybe ten minutes and I had a dream that Aunt Christine and Mom were going to drive me over to Grandma's house so that I could find a place to sleep. And so we got in her truck and we were driving, and we got there and it was turned into like a store. There were like racks of stuff there and her old carpet and things were still there, but it was all opened up and there was like this store and they were like selling like tourist gifts. And Grammy was there and she was like directing people around, and, of course, fussing like her usual self does. And there were no bedrooms there any more. And I think suddenly I was home in my room, and I had a feeling that it wasn't really real, but I went up to my bed and I laid down and I turned on my unit that's by my bed there, and it was so quiet that I had to bring it onto the bed next to me and like lay there and just it was okay. And I'm imagining this, but I just had the feeling that it wasn't real, that none of this was real. And so then I knew I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house, but I don't know what, even though I was kind of going to sleep in my dream, I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house.

"C-032"	"#C-032 (2003-08-16 (18)) I was staying in a hotel by myself that was like a few blocks from home because I was, there was a solo competition thing and I had to be there a few nights. And they had, I think Mom was there; we walked down there. And I forgot a few things and I was thinking how once they showed me around and once I got settled, I could always walk back [tape flipped] . I forgot a few things, but I could still walk back to the house and get them. And I dreamt that, you know how they want me to have mobility and all, I dreamt that I was going to say that I forgot my cane, because I really did, but my motive for going back to the house and getting it was to get my CD player, which I forgot also. [laugh] And I dreamt that this hotel was kind of pretty ornate. I don't remember too much because it was a few days ago. And there was something else really interesting a few days ago, but, of course, I forgot. We've just been running and running and running and I have this dumb prepaid legal tape that I'm recording over, so I guess it can just run on and on and on, and it's like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Now I remember what I was going to say before. A couple nights ago I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School again and I was preparing for this school-sponsored trick-or-treat thing for kids, and I had boxes of like food and candy and stuff in my book bag, and it was all on a dolly, like a cart thing, that I was ready to just wheel down the elevator and go off to where I needed to go. I was like upstairs in front of the Guidance Office. So I had Angel watch it so that nobody would mess with it while I went to go get some things out of my locker and go do a couple other things. So I'm doing a couple other things and then I come back and all the stuff is gone off the dolly cart thing, and Mom is upstairs in front of the Guidance Office with her bicycle with all the boxes on it. And Angel's like, ""I stole your book bag"" and she like threw it at me, you know, like they do sometimes. And I think Mom and I were going to go off to where we needed to go on the bicycle, but I don't know how we were going to get down the stairs. And then I woke up."
"C-033"	"#C-033 (2003-08-17 (18)) To start with I don't know if I was up here or back home, but I was at this bar with Mom and a few other people, I think one or two of my friends too. And there was this machine there, this vending machine, that you would put a quarter in and you would put a square, rectangular piece of bendy plastic in. It was like three dimensional. And then the machine would play a tune like ""Old MacDonald"" or ""London Bridge"" or some kids' song like that, while it was making the kid a figure. And it had like a little window where you could watch it through. And I can't remember, it wasn't scary, but the machine played ""London Bridges"" and ""Bluebird"" and a couple other things like that, but some of them I couldn't recognize. And I don't know what that had to do with anything, but I also, at this bar I was supposed to set up the sound system and do something, record something, I guess. And I didn't have the Peavey system; I had this big clunky thing. And somehow I made a recording with my voice talking over some music that's playing and making some announcements and stuff. And later on I played it back on my personal CD player. And it was so loud, my voice was like clipping, and I couldn't turn the volume down. It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle. [laugh] And that was kind of crazy. And so I figured, ""Next time I have got to pay more attention to the V meters, and they had these racks of equipment and they had a tape recorder, a CD recorder and a couple other things like the radio station does. And I had to stand on a chair and I still couldn't see all the meters well enough. So then I kind of woke and went to a different scene. Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that Dad came up here. He drove up here [laugh] and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Burt did at the farm that one day. But it wasn't a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, ""Oh no, he's going to be tagging along with us the next week and he's going to rain on our parade."" And he also saying things like, ""Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You shouldn't have to fly home. We should all drive home together."" And I was like, ""Oh no,"" that's the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I'm so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it's like boring when it's just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we didn't use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home. And then I woke up, fortunately. Let's see, I'm trying to remember."
"C-034"	"#C-034 (2003-08-24 (18)) I'm back from my trip, but I dreamt that I was still on my trip. First of all, the weirdest part, I dreamt that Melinda had this car that had this alarm thing that she didn't know how to shut off, or else she couldn't turn off unless she was going something like 50 or 60 miles an hour, so I think I was in Mr. Jameson's PE locker room again. I keep having dreams about stuff like back at Westport High School, and I don't understand it. So I was in Mr. Jameson's locker room waiting for Melinda to pick me up, but yet I'm still on my trip. I don't understand this notion. [laugh] And there was like this indoor race track thing that Melinda was going to drive by and kick me up and go. And the thing of it was, she had to go as fast as she could and I had to jump in as fast as I could so that we could get to the 50 or so miles an hour she needed to shut the alarm off. That sounds like a movie to me. [laugh] And so I'm waiting there and I don't really remember her ever, I heard the car with the alarm going on because she had to slow down a little to get into the race track thing, and I like grabbed onto the door and like jumped in and slammed the door and we raced off. And I think we were going kind of slow, but she finally got the alarm to shut off. I couldn't move around or anything. And then I dreamt that I was back in that locker room, and I had these pants, of all things, these pants that had an alarm on them. [laugh] And how it would get activated is if you would touch the end of the belt strap to the belt buckle, that would complete some kind of circuit and it wouldn't go off until you had the belt actually buckled. That was weird! Then I can't remember -- oh, I was at either Aunt Christine's house or Uncle Larry's house -- I can't remember which house. And we had all these aunties visiting us. And Dad was supposed to ride up on his bike any minute, I think, and come join the visiting party. And for whatever reason, I had a portable two-way radio, not in my pocket but literally stuffed down into my pants. I don't know why, but I didn't have to be actually keying the transmitter. There was this Auntie Lovely, Mom called her, who had another one, and supposedly was listening in on everything we were saying, and I didn't actually have to be keying the transmitter to let her hear what was going on; it just transmitted by itself. And then, when we were sitting there visiting, Uncle Larry was setting up the boombox and just as he was setting it up, this Auntie Lovely lady is talking to me through the unit, and it's real, real loud, and she's saying that she's almost there and she's going to be here real soon, and not to cut the cake without her or something. And I was thinking, ""Oh gosh, how embarrassing."" And I was hoping that they couldn't tell it was actually me. I was hoping that they could just feel that the sound was like in the air or something. So I figure, ""I have got to do something."" So I came in and I went into the bathroom, and I was going to like turn the volume down or turn that thing off or something, but then I kind of drifted into another scene. And this scene was that Mom and I had our car to drive up in Jackson and I had made a CD of the blue Wee Sing tape with the ""Bluebird"" song and everything on it. And for whatever reason, I had heard it three times earlier in the week and I wanted to play it again while we were driving around town. And so we did, and we were playing ""London Bridges"" and ""Bluebird"" and all those other things while we were driving through town. And it wasn't scary or anything. It was just that there were other relatives in the car and I didn't want them thinking that I was a baby by wanting to play that. And I think shortly thereafter I faded into consciousness. Oh no, I didn't. There was more to it. Oh my gosh, this goes on and on and on. I'm going to use up this tape. I dreamt that after driving all around and stuff, going home was just like a bicycle ride away, and so Mom and I were going to just ride the thing home. [laugh] And we sat out there talking to Aunt Christine for another hour as if we really didn't want to go home, but we knew we had to. And it was like 11:00 o'clock at night and we were still talking. And she gave us a blanket and a sheet and a little portable boombox machine that was actually like a kids' thing that was shaped like a bunny rabbit. And Mom stuffed it in her bicycle basket and then we started bicycling home in the night. And that's -- oh, and I didn't wake up yet. I dreamt that we got home and I was squished between Mom and Mrs. Dougherty on our porch swing, and we were telling her about her trip and some of the things that happened. And that's when I woke up finally. Oh, that was just so weird. [laugh] I mean, I can't even begin to sort it out. I mean, I think, they always say that the subconscious is nowhere near as bridled as the conscious mind. I think my conscious mind is severely ridiculing my subconscious for coming up with such weird whacko ideas. [laugh] But, you know, there must be a factor going on in me somewhere that I need to pay attention to, I mean, as bizarre it may be. One other thing, I don't remember too much about the dream I was having last night, not last night but the night before when I slept downstairs on the air mattress, but I do remember, you know that thing that Mr. Romane taught us in 4th grade? It goes, ""Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?"" That was a little song that he taught us, and he wanted us to move our hands up and down according to the intervals of the notes, and that, for whatever reason, kind of scared me -- not in the dream, but in the class that he taught it to us did. And moving my hands up and down according to the notes made it feel worse because I couldn't put my hands how I normally put them when something scares me like that. And in my dream a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was in a public bathroom and they were playing that over the intercom, and it wasn't too much of a thing, but it was a little thing. And so I think half awake and half asleep, I turned over the way that I do. But I got the worst back ache and I realized that on that mattress it's not good for me to lay like that. That was crazy!"
"C-035"	"#C-035 (2003-08-26 (18)) I was in this elevator with Melinda and a couple people from the Wilcox Center. It was really big, and had these glass windows kind of like the ones from the pier. And I had the notion that we had to get to the 14th floor of this building and we were kind of stuck, and we had to kind of ride up and down for a little while until somebody called it from the 14th floor and got it to open. And down below there were these people bouncing balls in a courtyard. We were looking through the elevator windows and we saw. And I kind of shifted to another scene that I was like with the transition people, and I had these raw cucumber slices and I like put them up against my eyes and kind of squinted to hold them there, to get kind of goofy like they do in the cartoons, because I used to do stuff like that when I was little. And they got so offended, thinking that I was making fun of myself and people who had terminal legal blindness. And I don't know where all that came from. It was small, but it was kind of crazy. So anyway, I think I did a pretty good job of filling up this tape. For once I will have timed it so that I'm done when it's done. Now I can finally take off that little piece of scotch tape that I put on the one side to let me record over this ""blah, blah, blah"" tape, and I can take the tape off and it'll just be a regular tape. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. [laugh]"

And then I was still asleep and dreaming, but I felt that I was laying here in my bed. And, as I was dreaming, essentially I was asleep, but I didn't know it, so I was dreaming that my hand could reach over and change it to 104.7 like I like to hear in the morning. But since I was sleeping, I had that tactile sensation, but I really wasn't doing it, so I didn't hear any audio feedback that that was happening. And I was sleeping still. I didn't actually physically get up, but in my dream I did. I got up and I looked at it, and it was even showing me the numbers of where it was going instead of the time.

This is a tape that used to be something boring that came in the mail that had a Braille label and I managed to rip it off, and I used this tape for me and ____ to goof around, as you could hear at the beginning. And so now I've got ample space left and I can't bear to just waste it, so I'm going to use it for some more dreams. I had the neatest one last night. First of all, let me start off like this, this is one of the bizarre parts. I dreamt that Celine's song, ""Prayer"" [she sings part of it] it starts off and the two verses go on just like they're supposed to, but in my dream there was no third verse and that magical key chain that she does in most of her songs. It was a car commercial in place of it. Can you believe it? And that's how I dreamt that it was recorded, and there was just nothing, it was like a big disappointment. And then I dreamt that I can't remember where I was or what I was doing -- but I was at this building -- I think it was a school or an office building or something; I can't remember what. But I needed to get on this elevator, and it was kind of a scary one because the building was twelve stories and I needed to go up to the 10th floor, so I hit #10 and we got there surprisingly fast. And I can't even remember what I was doing. Come to think of it, I think it was the Dome. I had to get up to the very top to do something with the sound board or something. And so I was at #10 and then I needed to get back down because I left my papers with the receptionist. And I got in the elevator and I needed to go ten stories down, and I hit #10 and I didn't grab the railing, and it just started to drop rapidly. And it's one of those things where you feel like you're falling and your reflexes make you physically jump and sometimes make you wake up. Well, I didn't wake up, but I felt myself jump, and I grabbed the railing and then I was okay, but it was like, ""Ahhhhh,"" free-fall. And that was really scary because I could feel myself getting closer and closer to the ceiling and then grabbed the railing and then I was okay. So I got down, and I had the feeling like the door wasn't going to open immediately, but it did. And you know what was fascinating, there was so much more to do, but I can't remember. I let the day get away from me because I was putting this off."
"C-038"	"#C-038 (2003-09-22 (18)) We'd just come home from our trip and last night I had a bizarre dream. I was in a bunk bed, if that had any effect on anything. First of all, I dreamt that I had to retake my AP test, and it wasn't the Spanish test; it was more of a test of the usage of English grammar and spelling, but mainly on what words had certain implications. And for some reason I had the notion that that test brought on a lot of feelings of pain and sadness and fear and all like that in me because in my dream I had the notion that I took the test a few years ago and I think I missed a question or two or three, and somebody who was giving the test wanted to give me a chance to redo it. And it was on a pink sheet of paper, but I had to put my new answers on the white sheet, just these three questions. And on the pink sheet were a couple of multiple choice questions at the top. Then, you know how Spanish verb conjugations have six lines going vertically down? Well, on these six lines, there were three sets of six lines, and on the first set of six lines I had to write, ""Oh, do you know the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man? Oh do you know the Muffin Man that lives on Dreary Lane?"" And on the next set of lines I had to write, ""Oh yes, I know the Muffin Man,"" and on and on. And on the last set I had to write, ""Now we all know the Muffin Man."" And I think there were one or two other things like that, and I had the notion that you were supposed to spell ""do"" like, ""Do you know the Muffin Man"" ""d-e-w"" [laugh] and I was going to have something major wrong on the test because I didn't spell it that way, but I wasn't sure, so I left it. And I answered a few of the multiple choice questions about certain words, but they were like whacko questions. I can't remember them exactly, but it asked about the odd meaning of odd words with kind of a strange implication factor. And I dreamt that I was telling somebody that having to finish that test brought back a lot of pain that I felt when I took the test that I all forgot about. And it wasn't necessarily just a fear, but it was a fear-sadness type of a thing. And I don't know what all that's about; that was weird. But somehow I felt, I woke up in the middle of the night because the air conditioner was too cold, and then I went back to sleep, and dreamt that it was Halloween and it was 5:00 o'clock in the evening. I had no candy to give out except for a little bag. I had no sound system on the porch because Mom kept putting off and putting off getting on her bike and going to get some candy from the supermarket. Dad was putting off and putting off going to the garage and fixing the Peavey system. So I dreamt that not only did I have to set up the Peavey system and all its parts, but I had to set up the CD thing and the wireless mic and everything all in about ten minutes, and I was feeling really, really overwhelmed. And there were these two teenage boys already ding-donging the doorbell and trick-or-treating. And I just barely had something to give them and a few decorations out. And then that was that. I faded into another scene that I was re-recording over the lullaby tape because the last song had accompaniment but no words. And I dreamt that I could just put the tape in and hit ""record"" and the recorder would automatically mix the new increment signal with the old. And it was a song that goes, [singing] ""Golden slumber then you'll rise, ________ away to ________. Sleep pretty baby, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby."" But anyway, I was re-recording that and then I faded into consciousness. I sort of had the notion that I had really don that, and I was realizing that I should have first copied the tape sound track accompaniment onto a CD RW, then mixed it with my mixer with my voice and recorded that mix onto the tape, not just the voice. And somehow I had the notion that that was all correlated, and the taking the test thing really had an impact on me. I mean, I didn't really feel it, but I sort of did. And I wondered have I taken any tests lately that have had some subtle implications that have blocked some subconscious things on, or what's the deal here? So that's that. I'm using up tape like crazy, I'm sure."
"C-039"	"#C-039 (2003-09-24 (18)) I was at Memorial Stadium, supposed to do a DJ thing, but I was kind of lost and wasn't sure where I was. And I dreamt that I was on the opposite of the field from where I usually am. I'm usually at Gate 1, but this time I was on the side that has the sound booth, that was like about Gate 4, and it was kind of scary, not in the ""whoo"" fear sense, but in the sense that orientatively scared, and that I was like at this concession stand and I had to go up, but for a minute I was perched at the very tippy top, the absolutely toppest seat that you can have in the actual ball field area. I think it was the 5th or 6th floor, and there was a railing and I was looking down. And it's not very often that I'm afraid of heights because I look down, but that time I looked down and I was like, ""How the heck did I get up here?"" And I was thinking how somehow the gates were going to open in five minutes, and the equipment was supposed to be set up around Gate, and I had to get there in five minutes, and I was at this tippy top seat. And I didn't have any CD's with me, and I was trying to think of some excuse how to get them to lend me some of theirs. Like, for example, that I didn't know I was supposed to be here today or something dumb like that. And before I could even do any of this, I woke up."
"C-040"	"#C-040 (2003-09-25 (18)) I'm not sure how much tape I have left, so I guess I'll have to be prepared to stop when I hear the thing coming to the end, and then start my sentence over again when it auto-reverses. Anyway, I had a kind of a blah dream last night. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, Dad had this mission to do somewhere up in the middle of the state. I think it was a medical thing. And he was going to leave -- I think it was Thursday -- and he was going to leave in the middle of the night and he was going to be gone Friday, Saturday and Sunday and he was going to be coming home sometime on Monday night. And while he was gone Mom and I and everybody -- it was kind of understood that Mom and I were going to go up to Modern Media College (?) by ourselves [laugh] and have a tour there. And get this -- Samantha, Sandra and Derek were going to meet us there. [laugh] And we were all going to come home and have a big house party at home. And I think they were going to hang around for the week, but I can't remember. They might have been going to be gone by the time we got home, I can't remember. But it was some party that we were really looking forward to. And so I think it was that he left in the middle of the night, and then it was the next day, and early Friday morning he was home. And for some reason, I can't remember why, the trip for us to Modern Media College was off, and we communicated to Samantha, Sandra and Derek that they should come meet us down in Westportrsburg instead. And they weren't supposed to get here until Saturday afternoon. Well, you know, Dad has to be thinking about every single thing. He was starting to do a lot of that around the house, and I was thinking, ""Why the heck are you home so soon anyway?"" And I couldn't wait for Samantha, Sandra and Derek to get here, but I woke up before they did. And also in this dream, again before any of this happened, I dreamt that we were watching this spoof on the Mermaid movie, and there was this part to it that I never saw before. It was like telling some of the historical aspects of some of the characters that I never knew, like I guess some of Eric's friends. And Eric's friends were Arabic, and I dreamt that Eric was Arabic like Aladdin is. I guess the media is taking over. And I guess the movie showed the history of it. Wait, I think it's going to flip. No, it's not, I've got a ways yet. Anyway, it showed the history of Eric's background, which I'd never seen before, and I think there was one brief scene in the movie where King Triton was eating French soup or spaghetti or something. [laugh] That was odd! Now I know there was something else to this, but I can't remember what it was. Oh, I know, during all the nit-picking and stuff, I was on the phone with Jane, and she had a lower voice, and she had matured a little more, and she talked about things that were more diversified and she was a little more pleasant to talk to. And I guess that's that. I guess it came from the fact that Mom and Dad are going to take this defensive driving course to kind of lower their insurance rates, and it's four hours each day on two days, and it was on a Monday and a Tuesday, are the two days that they're going. And, you know, I get a ____ for them Tuesday and Thursday, so, of course, I wish they'd go on a Monday and Wednesday, but it's not given on Wednesdays. Oh well."
"C-041"	"#C-041 (2003-09-29 (18)) I was going to just go ahead and type it out because it's really too complicated to be describing on this tape. But maybe not; maybe I'll do alright. I dreamt that I was having this vision that when Dad was a little boy he was afraid of the same sounds that I am, and that they affected him the same way. And I was having a vision that if a nice person were there to help him through it, it would have been a lot better for him. And the chords of C, E and G, the interval that would get me, is from G to E descending, or any chord for that matter from the top to the middle, top to the middle, top to the middle like, ""Ding [higher] , ding [lower] , ding [higher] , ding [lower] ."" And I guess in this dream I had a vision of somebody doing that on a keyboard and Jimmy's three years old crying, and that was weird. And then I kind of jumped over to another vision, that Mom had these candles. And they were candles, okay? Candles do not make sounds. [laugh] There were these candles and they had different sounds, but there were three of them and they were called C-E-G candles because when you would light them, they would produce the chord of C, E and G over the sound system, along with a bunch of other crazy sounds. And [laugh] this is bizarre. And Mom wanted to try them out with the sound system like at top volume. And it wasn't going to be a scary thing; it was just going to be a thing. And when she lit the candles, it was like -- you know how 1930s and 40's jazz was like, [musical sounds] -- well, it was kind of like that, it was like the funny jazz that we can't stand. And I guess that was the extent of it and then I woke up. I think the candles came in because Mom got some candles from Clark and Marilou. And they were just smelly candles; I can't imagine where I would get the thought that they would make sounds. Anyway, that's that."
"C-042"	"#C-042 (2003-10-02 (18)) We were -- Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town again, and we were watching a video for my 18th birthday party, which I sort of remember attending simultaneously. It was like we started watching the video and suddenly I was there, that kind of thing. I remember it was just like my graduation party except it was like a year after, only this is not really what my 18th birthday was like; this is how I dreamt it was like. We were at the Hilton and I focused in on this crystal chandelier that was like, ""Whoo hoo, _________,"" because I had seen some crystal chandeliers in the ____ing catalog at the ramp (?) place. And somebody was sneaking in to do something, it was Sandra I think. Well, then I was like there at the party, and, you know, dancing and partying and stuff. And of all things, Sandra had Digital Performer on her laptop and she was like -- what should I say? -- recording and mixing the sound right there, kind of like what Dr. Moran was doing with Cake Walk in class -- no wonder! [laugh] I can't remember anything about what she was doing, but then the next thing I knew, we were in my studio and she wanted to transfer the tracks to my desktop so that I could work with them, and I did a lot of hokus pokus last ____ and stuff and she said that my task ____ board can do a lot more than what I usually use it for. And what it is, in reality, is that it takes a_____ audio, turns it into digital, sends it down a USB and __________ because digital audio from a USB converts it to, it's like an external sound card almost. That's why I don't need an internal one. And it also had faders and a couple other controls on it that you can move tactilely and it'll send mini messages to the real faders to move. And Da_____ ______ thought that that feature would be great for me because I'm more tactile than visual, but I found that it was a lot easier just to go to the mixer page and look at one channel at a time and move the faders there because the task scan doesn't have the automatically _______ faders which is clicked in the position when you open up the program like some do. It doesn't move automatically as you move the faders on the screen; it has to synchronize them. And that is a real pain, trust me. And but so Sandra was doing all these things ________, but like ______ teachers that don't help teach me and __________ haven't discovered it. She was doing it right from there, in my dream, of course. And I said, ""Wow, I should be able to do that too."" [laugh] And let's see, then here comes the most bizarre part. I was in this supermarket with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and we were like tasting candy. There was this one mix of candy called Amazing Grace that had like white chocolate balls and different stuff, but I had this plastic sign banana thing with a picture of a wave form on it, and it was represented as of the audio from the Wave Form editor. And I was [laugh] down in this big center area, court like type thing in the supermarket with all kinds of people walking around. I was sitting there moving my finger along this sign banner, trying to highlight and edit the wave form. Now talk about bizarre. And I think shortly thereafter I woke up. You know, sometimes when I sit there doing all that editing, I say to myself, ""I'm going to be seeing wave forms in my dreams."""
"C-043"	"#C-043 (2003-10-07 (18)) I was at Westport College, going to my classes, going about my business. But in my dream my classes were kind of boring, and I had the notion that Mom was telling me that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hospital for some reason. And I can't remember, but she told me that she had really changed. And I had a vision of kind of in this dream, I kind of had a vision of the scene that Mom was telling me about. It was like a vision within a dream, of Mrs. Dougherty standing out in the hallway in front of the little theater at Westport High School kind of crying and feeling really dejected, and saying through her tears how she was just totally so disappointed with all her students and totally jaded by all of them. And she decided that teaching high school music just wasn't for her, and she was going to have to find some other profession, but it was in a really boring field she didn't really like. And I don't know why, whether it was for a nervous breakdown or for something unrelated or what, but she was in the hospital. And I dream that Mom was going to pick me up from Westport College at lunch time and take me there. And I had this thank you card that I wanted to give her from graduation, which I really do; it's sitting on my desk. But in my dream I was going to give it to her when Mom brought me over there. And I started out at Westport College in the morning, and instead of being in my class, my first class was in this bedroom and the guy was like 18 and he was a black guy and he was an instructor. I had a feeling it was Lorenzo from the electronics class. And it was me and him and four other boys that were going to be in his class that was taught in his bedroom. [laugh] And he and the guys left, and I just kind of sat there bored for like half an hour, drawing and writing, and he came back and I said, ""Okay, I'm ready."" And he just said this silly little poem to us and then it was time for us to go to lunch. And I stood out where I usually wait for the cab, but in my dream I was waiting for Mom. And then I woke up. I think this came from the fact that Mrs. Dougherty called Mom and wants her to help hem dresses, and I want to give her that thank you card, and I'm kind of worried about how she's doing this year. I know her kids seemed better last year, and I hope they're better this year. Anyway, that's that."
"C-044"	"#C-044 (2003-10-08 (18)) Consisted of a lot of different components and scenes last night, so I'll try to remember what I can. There's no guarantee it'll be in any kind of order, but oh well. First of all I dreamt that we rented the Coliseum. I'm not sure if we rented the Coliseum or if we were just going to a dance that was held there. But we had the Coliseum, we were there, and it was going to be this Valentine's Dance with this band, Tommy and the Fiends (?), I think, or something similar. And some of the fireman people and different friends of ours were going to be there. And I dreamt that, for whatever reason, we were riding our bikes over, so we wore our sloppy clothes over and we were going to change into our dresses when we got there. And I was going to wear my nice red dress and some nice jewelry, and my Mom was going to wear her Franny dress. And you know what? I had the notion that this was a Valentine's and a Halloween Dance -- is that bizarre or what? Well, so anyway, we got over there and Mom forgot the dresses, so she had to go all the way back home and I was sitting in the Coliseum lobby and Dad should meet me there. And I think I was there before him. And I had the notion that all of our friends were there too, but I didn't know who they were. And somebody up at the desk suggested that they all watch Braveheart while they were waiting, and it was like a pay per view movie, and anybody who wanted to watch the movie had to pay. But they said, ""If you want to watch the movie, show me by looking at the TV. If you don't want to watch the movie, look over at that thing on the wall over there."" And, of course, I was just looking down the whole time, so I think it was obvious that I didn't want to watch the movie, but I wasn't sure. And so then all of a sudden I think I was in school and I was waiting for them to bring the costumes in school. And I was in Dr. Moran's lab and I had the notion that I had written a report in there and I had to print something, like Mom brought the first three pages of my report but she forgot the fourth one, so I had to go in and I had to print my fourth one. And that was successful. And also, then after I printed my fourth report page, I went to Cake Walk, even though it looked totally different than what I'm used to it looking like in real life, and I dreamt that I had, I was mixing like a scene from the Little Mermaid, and I had too many tracks and an audio track, and I don't remember what was in them except it was the Ursula scene. And I had to mix down the two _____ tracks into audio track, then I had to mix the two audio tracks down into one, so I had to do a lot of complicated maneuvers in order to do this, and in my dream I had a nice big cursor that I could follow fast, and I didn't have this ""when you flow"" factor like I do in school. And then as I was doing all this, a girl came on next to me and said something like, ""Hey, what are you doing?"" And she kind of distracted me, and I think -- I can't remember -- but then the scene like suddenly changed and I was back at the Coliseum, but I was outside like on a beach, and I dreamt that now Dad wanted us to wait for him on this beach, and he was coming with Mom with the dresses after a while. And they were having a little party on this beach, and I was sitting under a little umbrella so that I wouldn't get burned by the sun, and I was sitting on this like lawn chair that was like a couch almost. So I put my feet up and was laying back, and there were other people milling around getting like food and c_____s and stuff, and I had this small radio, about the size of my tape machine, maybe a little bigger, and it had an antenna that was kind of standing up, and it was on, but it was kind of quiet, and I was concerned about when people go by, was it going to be really odd or what? [laugh] You know, like ________. And I was laying there, like, ""Dee dee, la dee dah,"" taking it all in, and then I woke up. I never did get to the Coliseum dance."
"C-045"	"#C-045 (2003-10-12 (18)) I had like a really stupid dream a few days ago, and I thought it was too silly and too weird to put on this tape. I just wanted to forget about it. But today, I'm doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there's got to be something to it, so I guess I'm going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was Mom, Dad and I think Aunt Christine and Burt were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was Mom and me and some guy -- I don't know who -- and Mom had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. Mom wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw Mom do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don't remember too much more. There had to be more though."
"C-046"	"#C-046 (2003-10-13 (18)) It wasn't all that odd, but I wish I would quit having dreams about programs I used to mix sound. I mean, it's getting a little crazy now. [laugh] I'm not really sure which of these scenes came first, but I think this is the first one. I was -- how come I can't talk this morning? Okay, I think I'm ready. I was at this -- no, wait -- first I was at the house and my Mac machine was on the front porch. In place of the white bench there was a little table where I was sitting and working. And I was working on some part of DP all visually because the rest of my system was all upstairs, but for some reason that was there, I guess because in my dream Dad figured we could both work side by side, because he would be in the foyer and I would be out there. But the rest of my system wasn't there with it, and I was thinking, ""How in the world am I going to be able to get this back to my studio where my audio system is. Even my task scan was still up here. And just about that point I was deleting a few sound bites, and I was working on something in DP, and Margaret and Ken's mother and their family were inside. I don't know how they got there; they didn't walk past me from the front door. And I think Melinda was there too. And it was like a post-graduation. We didn't get to come to the party, so let's have the party at your house kind of party, even though in real life they did come to graduation. And so I got up from my work for a minute and head into the kitchen to go say hi and then come back and shut down. But before I knew it, I was dancing with them, I was partying with them, I was opening presents with them. And it was dark by the time the party was like in full swing, and I realized I didn't get to shut down. And Dad said, ""Don't worry, I shut down for you already."" And that was that. And then out of the group of people that was there, there was this one black girl, and her name was Arkisha, and Dad was talking on the phone to a Geico agent named Arkisha before. But this girl Arkisha was about my age and she wanted to go to Westport College with me, and she said that she had these friends that were in this Spanish band that were doing some kind of recording test in Dr. Moran's lab, and it was like they're weren't testing out the equipment. The test was on them to see how well they knew how to use the equipment. And Arkisha thought that I knew a lot and wanted me and this other boy to come and help them because they needed assistance. And so in my dream Westport College was like just a walk away, like up on 7th Street, and it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk over there. So we walked over there and I was barefoot, and I had like real sloppy clothes on, and we were walking around the school. And in my dream it was neat to feel the surfaces of the floor and stuff with my bare feet. And we went into Dr. Moran's lab, and it was bigger and it had a blue floor. And there was this little area off to the side where people let bands go when they have to record, which there really isn't. It was like an enclosed glass area with a stage and a sound board. And we were in there and Dr. Moran said that I couldn't help those boys because I knew too much and that I wasn't going to be just a hand, I was going to be wanting to tell them lots of information for their test. And so I was going to go home, and so I was walking out and walking home and again, it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk home because I only had to go like two blocks. And then before I got home, I kind of started waking up, and then I realized where it really was and that it really was too far to walk. And then I kind of faded into consciousness."
"C-047"	"#C-047 (2003-10-14 (18)) At this point all I can remember of my dream last night is that we were all sitting around in the living room naked, like we do talking (?). And there were these people outside kind of milling around. A little later on when we put our clothes on, they ding-donged the doorbell. They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don't know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, ""I made __________ over there."" And then they got a little more serious and said like, ""Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on,"" or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and Dad wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, ""There's got to be a better way to defend myself."" And, I don't know, he said something crazy like, ""You'll scream and you'll get maimed and killed."" And I think that I woke up."
"C-048"	"#C-048 (2003-10-15 (18)) I had kind of an interesting dream last night because it was like very vivid. I dreamt that we were going camping with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly on a Sunday up to, I think it was something like Goldhead State Park, or something like that. And Astrid, when the dream took place, it was like a Wednesday, it was like a few days before camping, Astrid was over and, well, I think even before Astrid got there, Dad was being a little crabby like he gets some times, and Astrid shows up and then Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly show up. And I'm thinking, ""Oh good, we might be able to go a little early,"" and, of course, a lot of people to be with, so things will be under control. And I think Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly came into my bedroom and I was like half naked, and I got a top and I put on a top, and I had to go pee and do a bunch of other things. And little did I know, but Astrid was sitting around bored most of that time. And I came into the living room and she was telling Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, ""Twice now this has happened. She asked me over and got totally distracted,"" something like that. And I came and sat down next to her. She was still talking as I was walking up because she didn't now I was coming. And then I sat down and I took her hand and I talked to her to let her know I was there. And she moved her hand against my shoulder, which she's never done before in real life, and I was like, ""I'm sorry, I just had a lot of cleaning to do and stuff."" And then when she was, a little while later, she leaned up and kind of kissed me on the cheek. [laugh] And then, here comes the really bizarre part. I dreamt that this camping trip -- well, not just for this camping trip -- it had been done before, to have my whole system and everything piled into the back of the car, have the back seat taken out replaced with my desk and all my equipment. And I think I was counting on this setup for this trip because it was going to be quite a drive and I had some work to do for, I think for Dr. Moran, but I'm not sure who. And I can't remember what in the world I was working on, but it was some kind of sequence. I kind of was thinking at that point that I would have access to the thing at school before I left [laugh] , and I could do some of it there. And then suddenly in the course of all this, the scene shifted and I was at Dr. Moran's lab, except it was a huge room, and there were 40 or 50 work stations, kind of like in the commons on the second floor of the Business Tech Building that people were telling me about. Well, this place was like that except the work stations were like I'm used to working at. And somebody, like two or three work stations down from me, wanted to put a picture of Santa Claus on their desktop, and actually it was a picture of her uncle dressed as Santa Claus. [laugh] And I heard somebody warning the person, like the Santa Claus picture that she had might have a virus in it, but nobody seemed to really concede. And then next thing I knew, everybody had Santa Clauses on their desktops because, I guess in that situation, it would be like a network and I guess what would happen to one would happen to all of them. But I had a Santa Claus on my desktop, but I wanted to get rid of it because I wanted the picture that I had before which I can't remember what it was. I didn't have a picture in real life, but in my dream I was used to having a picture of me in my home studio, I think. And so I wanted that picture back. And in the a process of trying to get rid of this Santa Claus and get my picture back, something happened, and I can't remember if it was serious or not. But it was kind of in a fog and I faded into yet another scene, that I was at home and I was listening to like the American Idol on 94.9, and it had somebody doing their version of Celine's ""On the Line"" and it sounded darned close, but it wasn't. And then they were doing like other people's versions of other songs. I can't remember exactly what they were. And then I woke up."
"C-049"	"#C-049 (2003-10-16 (18)) Man, I seem to be having really neat dreams every day these days. I don't know what's up, but I dreamt that I was with this performing group. I don't know if it was a chorus of singers or a dance group, or just a group of friends, but it was some kind of group. And I had a notion that we were either going to perform or have some kind of fun that looked like performing. But we were at this big hall, like the Bayfront Center, and there was an ice rink, and I wanted to get on the ice rink so that I could dance and ice skate with the others. But there were these, all these things around the perimeter, like cover things or grate things that I was afraid of and I was afraid of stepping on. And I was bare foot and I was trying to navigate between them, and more of them kept popping up, and so I had to just back out and not go near the ice rink. And I know there were more scenes, but this is what I get for waiting this late in the day. I don't remember any more."
"C-050"	"#C-050 (2003-10-18 (18)) Well, I guess you could say I had three dreams last night because it spanned three different areas. After all, they say we have a minimum of three dreams a night and a maximum of nine, so I guess I remember all three last night. First of all, this is kind of, we were watching -- oh, wait a minute -- I think there were even some more. I remember a fourth part to this. My goodness! Seeming you remember little parts, your imagination cues and you remember the rest. Dad and Mom and me and even some other people were on this boat, and I can't remember for sure, but we were going to dock somewhere for the night, and we were going to keep going and then we were going to come back and dock in a different place for the night. And I think what it was, is we were trying to figure out where to dock. There was this docking place that was kind of old-fashioned that was built with like a porch swing and some interesting things, and a little lodge thing. And I don't remember why we chose that place, but kind of for the reason that we chose bed and breakfasts over just hotels. And let's see, I really don't remember the details, but it was something about this place where we were going to dock, kind of it was an open, it was a real live environment, like we were under water, but it wasn't; it was on top. It was like this hotel place. And so then the next scene was, is we were in this hotel place kind of sitting around, but it kind of turned into our living room, and we were watching -- or at least I was watching -- Celine's Las Vegas show on TV, and how some of the things were just so complicated. And then at the end of the show it had a feature that showed her dying of a virus that she contracted from Reyna, and that was like the worst thing. And then I think the next part of the dream was that I was in Dr. Schumann's class for Psychology and he was showing us different pictures in the book, like a baby, or a horse, or other things and asking us, ""What do you think people would think when they see this symbol?"" And the class was like totally out of it, but I was real involved and real excited about what he was talking about and everything. Then the next part was that I was in the bathroom of the Social Arts Building at Westport College that kind of put me in mind of the Bell Building at Westport High School. And there was this boy in there that, well, I just sort of knew that the alarm box in the bathroom wasn't working and this boy knew that a fuse had to be replaced, and he had the correct kind of fuse with him. And the boy wanted me to be in there with him when he was doing this because he said that I knew something about electronics that he was unsure of. He had this kind of real mamby pamby lack of self-confidence. So how it ended up was that I was sitting in the bathroom stall on the toilet, not really having to go, just sitting in there. And I heard him clinking and screwing and messing around, but I didn't see what he was doing, of course. And I was just sitting on this toilet totally terrified in fright of what was going to happen if the system sounded. And I was kind of like cowering down and something like that, and the boy assured me that when the alarm system is tested, it's only going to sound at like a quarter of the strength that it would if it was really a real incident. So believing him, I was a little at ease, but I was still real frightened of the whole thing. And [sigh] , let's see, oh, when he finished and he put the thing all back together, he tested it and it was only a quarter of the intensity. In fact, I could barely hear it, and he was like, ""How do I get this thing to come on full?"" meaning the alarm system. And I was like, ""I don't know, but you could ask the maintenance people."" And he was a nice boy. He wasn't one of these teenage sadists, so he gave me time. He said he was going to give me time to get outside and get far away from the building and all like that, and when I went out the back of the Social Arts Building, it was like the track on the PE field of Westport High School, and I sat down near these people that I thought I knew. I started talking to them and they said how, for degree-seeking students, how your first semester was like four general ed classes, boom, boom, boom. And that's what they took, and they said how bored they were. And I was glad I wasn't in their position. And I think that the last part of this dream was that I was back in Dr. Schumann's class, and he wasn't showing us symbols like a baby or a horse. He was showing us more serious symbols like what does it mean to speak to people, how do you think people feel when they have their eyes covered? What happens when they hear certain things? And just real in-depth things like that. And again, the class was like, ""Uh, uh, uh, uhhh...."" And I was raising my hand and wanting to talk about some of these things, and he was like looking around for the rest of the ""Uhhhhh, uhhhhh"" people and trying to enlist them into paying attention and stuff. And then I woke up. [laugh] I have a voice analysis to give about the second part of this dream, the part about being in the bathroom with that boy while he was fixing the alarm box in the bathroom. I think that, first of all in this case, the bathroom does not represent a cleansing environment. It might, but most likely it represents a live environment which would be the worst place that a person would want to be when an alarm system sounds. But what it could be is it could be a cleansing place that appears to have some kind of frightening thing to overcome in order to cleanse yourself. And, of course, the alarm system is the major element of fear in this part, and represents something majorly frightening. The boy, I tend to think, represents a higher power, because the boy really is sympathetic to my being afraid of the alarm system, but he wants me to participate in the operation that he is doing, even though he knows that I'm majorly afraid of it, because he thinks that I can contribute to it in some positive way. And he assures me that it won't be as bad as I'm making it out to be. And also he isn't, he gave me plenty of time to escape when he did want the system to sound at full capacity. So I think there's something going on here, something that needs to occur in my life that may seem frightening, but is worthwhile and I just to have to go through it. [laugh] I don't know. This is deep, man. [laugh]"
"C-051"	"#C-051 (2003-10-20 (18)) I was like a b___ enrollment student doing Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at Westport High School, and only being excused for the time I had to go to the college. And I had a test that I had to take in Psychology at the college, but the test was given to the office of Westport High School for some reason and I had to go by Ms. Teddy's office and get it. And I had to do a couple other things that I can't remember, but I want to know why I keep dreaming about being back in Mr. Jameson's class. It was boring, so I really don't want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am. And I dreamt that I was in Mr. Jameson's class and we were lifting weights and listening to his boombox, and I had to get out of class and go take my test, but I was kind of chicken and didn't know how to ask him and he wasn't even around. And so I had the notion that I'd better just leave and go take my test. And then I woke up."
"C-052"	"#C-052 (2003-10-21 (18)) I had kind of a funky dream about Astrid. I dreamt that it was kind of daylight, but I was still half asleep, and there was somebody in my bed and I thought it was Mom, so I rolled over and put my arm around her like when I do when Mom's in my bed. Well, after a while, she turned over and started talking to me, and I realized it was Astrid and she was kind of holding me too, just like Mom does. But for some reason she was calling herself Krystal. And we were talking about various things, like I don't think she told her Greek mythology story again, but she was thinking how, she was just chatting like people do. And, let's see, I think we got up and we were rearranging my closet, putting some clothes in order and stuff, and I was showing her my porcelain dolls and she was like changing. In life we just dress in front of each other because, first of all, she can't really see so it's not a big deal to her. And, of course, I'm a natural body person so it's not important to me. And so it just works out both ways and we just dress right in front of each other. So that's what we did in my dream. And I had this glow worm that I was showing her [laugh] and the glow worm had like a head band with a butterfly, and she was going to take the butterfly off the head band. Here's where it gets bizarre [laugh] . So anyway, she wanted to take the butterfly off the head band of the glow worm and put it on a ribbon to tie around her waist -- I don't remember how and it was kind of a little scary -- but I was, for some reason she like did something really weird and I had to explain to her about a woman's body and why her private area was important to be clean and covered and all. And she seemed to understand, she seemed to be taking it like a sisterly thing. And then I woke up. And it's funny because oftentimes when I first wake up I can't remember my dream at all. And I just have to think for a while. And sometimes they come to me in the middle of the day. Most people it's just the opposite, and that's how this one worked."
"C-053"	"#C-053 (2003-10-22 (18)) We were going up to ________  again, or somewhere up there, I wasn't exactly sure where it is, and we were going to stay at this rental like party house with, instead of Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, we were going to stay with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Aunt Christine and Burt and Josie and Bobby. And there were about two or three bedrooms on the bottom floor, like two bedrooms on the top floor, and one bedroom at the very tippy top of the third floor. And mine was up on the third floor. Mine was the top one because I had like a lot of sound equipment that I was bringing in for their party, and, come to think of it, it wouldn't make sense to put me and my equipment on the third floor. It would make sense to put us on the ground floor! But in my dream I was on the third floor and this place had an elevator, so I guess I could get it down alright. And to get there I think Mom and Dad preceded me because I had one more day of classes or something. And so I was on this bus, and I had two Peavey Escort systems for some crazy reason, I had a bunch of other stuff, but I wasn't sure exactly what. And I never actually had it in my hands. I had a few people helping me get it on the bus and into this cargo bay, and then when I got there, I don't remember getting there; I just remember suddenly being there. And I don't remember too much about the party we were having, but I do remember staying there, and I sort of remember something about us being together for like a little party or something, and it was outside on the deck. I had the Peavey system out there with the wireless mic. And then we kind of all went to sleep. I had the notion that the party was on the last night that we were going to be there, so after the party I didn't take the Peavey system down and bring it back to my room or anything, I just left it set up. And we all kind of went to sleep. And I remember that night I didn't go up to my room on the third floor with some other equipment piled into my room. That night I just went to _____ and I crashed in Samantha, Sandra and Derek's room with them. And the next morning -- you know how Dad likes to leave out of the house like 4:00 o'clock in the morning if we've got to drive across the state so we can get home at like a reasonable hour? Well, that's what we did, and, of course, I don't have any brains at that hour and then I think we were in the car and halfway through coming home, I realized I forgot both of the Peavey systems and all my other equipment. I left it there. And it was really a bad thing because Halloween was right around the corner. And we called Uncle Burt on the cell phone and he said, ""No problem, we'll swing by that way on the next step on our trip. We'll bring it and drop it off for you."" And we said, ""Okay, that would be great."" And, let's see, oh, when we got home, Uncle Burt had sent a new bag of Halloween things for me, like some plastic rats and some spiders and two statues -- no, three or four statues of cats coming out of pumpkins and ghosts and various things and like lab (?) statues that were like about as tall as my figures now. And there was a statue of Sir Mix-a-Lot, and at the base of the figure it said, ""Baby Got Back."" [laugh] And, of course, Mom was complaining. Oh, and there was one other thing he gave me. It was like a head, a pilgrim head on a stick with a stand. And Mom was really upset because she didn't want to store all this new Halloween stuff. And she was like totally spoiling it for me. And all this stuff was meant to be a thank you for DJ'ing their party or something like that. And then I began to fade into consciousness and I was still kind of out there, but I realized that my Peavey system is on the porch. I just handled it last night, but I was wondering if I had left the wireless mic and other stuff over there. And then when I really came to, I realized that I only have one and it's all in my c__________ and that was just a dream. [laugh]"
"C-054"	"#C-054 (2003-10-24 (18)) I was, I got like a, it was not like a mini disc machine, but it was sort of like that, and it came with five or six packs of like little mini CD R's and it was like a mini disc, except the medium was CD's instead of they're like mini CD's. And I don't remember actually, but I remember thinking how good it was that I had five or six packages of these things. And I don't remember too much except I think Dad wanted me to wrap it up and take it down to like the beach or something so that we could have a party out there and I could like open it for my birthday or something. And then suddenly the scene shifted, and I was in the downstairs bedroom listening to a couple CD's, and I dreamt there was a CD changer in there, which there really isn't, and it was like 6:00 o'clock in the morning when I was doing this. And Mom comes in and all of a sudden I was trying to turn it down because I'm a little embarrassed that I'm like just here. And she said, ""It's alright, it's alright,"" and something like that. She told me something else that she's going to do. She's like going to do something in the kitchen or something. So she goes in the kitchen and all of a sudden the kitchen radio in there, I had the notion that it's a CD changer also, and all of a sudden the CD that I was listening to jumps over there to her and she has to listen to it, and it was kind of a dumb one. And I can't remember anything more. I think I woke up after that. There was something else I remember about this dream now. For some reason, after Mom and I had talked, I was laying there on the bed thinking up a story."
"C-055"	"#C-055 (2003-10-27 (18)) I remember a bunch of scenes, but I can't really tell you which ones came first. But I'll do my best at putting them in order. This is going to be another one that uses up a lot of tape, I think. First, I think, I was having lunch with Ms. Garland at this little strip of shops and restaurants that I had the notion was part of the Westport College campus or just off of it or something. We were eating there and there were some interesting places there, and I was watching the time close because I had to get up to class. And so I went over to the Fine Arts Building, which looked more like the Media Center from Westport High School, and I went into class. Then next day I was there with Mom and it was like evening time, and I think I had asked her to take me to a bar or take me dancing or something, since I'm 18 now. And so we were going to this little restaurant place that we thought was going to be cool, and they had this table and chairs outside with their sound system set up and this band that was playing some good stuff. And we were dancing and dancing for a while, I think, and then she's like, ""I've got to take you somewhere else for a minute, but we'll come back here, I promise."" And she took me into this store, or some kind of place, next door in the shopping plaza thing. And it had an ivory-colored, off-white colored floor. It was almost yellow because of the lights. It was like Circuit City or something. And she was going to like boost me up on her shoulder. She used to be able to do that, but now Dad's only strong enough to. But anyway, in my dream she could still boost me up on her shoulder. She's like, ""One, two, three,"" and I was like perched on her shoulder and she was showing me this shelf way up high that had like six keyboards laid out on it. And I was like, ""Wow!"" And so then she got me down and we went back dancing at that place for a while [laugh] and I'm trying to think here. And I think we danced or something, or we ordered some food or something, but then the scene just sort of like changed, and I was in the Fine Arts Building, which like I said, which kind of looked like the Media Center at Westport High School. And I was trying to find my class, I was trying to find Dr. Moran's lab in there, and I was walking around this hall and I came across this room that I went in. It was really dark and there were three or four girls kneeling in there rehearsing this song in harmony, and I didn't know then that I didn't know the song, and I had this like furry purse with me that was black and I sort of in my head called it a mink purse. And so I didn't really know them and so I just left, and I was coming down the stairs, and the stairs were real, real narrow. There was no railing on one side, and there was a sort of a ""meh"" railing on the other side, and I was going down the stairs and I managed to get down alright, sort of. It was really steep and really narrow, like I dream about stairwells being sometimes. It wasn't dark and scary like they are sometimes, it was just hard for me to navigate, especially with the purse that turned into my book bag in the other hand. And I got down and Mom -- I can't remember if it was Mom, I think it was Mom -- picked me up in the truck, and we were going to the park. And when we got to one intersection there were like, I couldn't see them but she told me they were there -- there were like two fire trucks, a rescue truck, and a ladder truck, I think -- four trucks all together. And I kind of felt like maybe Dad was in one of them and they were going to a call. And they were all running their lights and sirens. How it would work was they would only run their lights and sirens when they were moving, so when they stopped at a red light, they wouldn't run them. And so it seemed that they would always be an intersection ahead of us, and when we would catch up to them and stop at their intersection, we would all go at the same time. And then when their lights and sirens would race past us and I would hear them real loud for minutes and then they'd be like past us. And then they would wait at the next intersection until we got there, and they wouldn't go until we got there. And then they ran their lights and sirens real loud in our faces again. And they did that like three times and I was like terrified when we got to the park. But fortunately, when we got to the park, they turned down another street and were gone. And then I woke up. [laugh]"
"C-056"	"#C-056 (2003-11-02 (18)) I had to go to school at Westport College and I had to ride a bus, and for some reason my classes didn't start until 9:00 o'clock so the bus could wait until 8:25 to come and it would be okay. Well, let's see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there's a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martenson is out, his name is Austin Reilly. In my dream Austin Reilly didn't think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can't remember what we were talking about, but Dad and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn't get to write the paper. And then -- this is the crazy part [laugh] -- there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn't. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn't have that kind of time. And I can't remember why I put it [laugh] . We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany's pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and Dad was walking out the door, he said something like, ""But I'm not sure, but you guys just hate it!"" And then I woke up."
"C-057"	"#C-057 (2003-11-03 (18)) We were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby's all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby's, then it got to the point they didn't really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby's. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had -- what should I say -- this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry-go-around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a -- they didn't really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I can't remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite [laugh] or something stupid like that. And, let's see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage 1 sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I couldn't get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And Mom was like, ""She's asleep, she's asleep,"" on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up."
"C-058"	"#C-058 (2003-11-04 (18)) I was in bed in this strange place, and Mom came up and I was kind of half asleep and half awake, and started picking the scab off my foot with tweezers and it hurt so much and I screamed. And then she was gone. So then I was out to find her. So we were staying in these like three or four level house unit things, like we were exploring across the street from the park on 5th Street and I saw that it was becoming daylight by the time I got out there. And Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce had one and they were sitting out on their front porch. But I couldn't find the one for Mom and Dad and there were a lot of them that didn't look like anything. So then I was just trying to run back and find mine and I couldn't. I couldn't find -- there were like ten of these things in a row and I couldn't find mine. And then I sort of woke up."
"C-059"	"#C-059 (2003-11-04 (18)) We were with Merrilee and she was doing this little home video presentation like type thing and we were going to help her. I don't know if it was Merrilee or Terri, but I think it started out as Merrilee, and we were in her house and we were doing some talking and singing and stuff by video. Then I realized Merrilee turned into Terri and she was taking pictures of us naked, just as normal as anything, in this like bare garage area. And I had to go home and get another set piece, and I ran back and I set up, and they didn't need it after all. They were just going to take pictures of us on the couch. And that's all, I think."
"C-060"	"#C-060 (2003-11-05 (18)) Dad had some kind of city meeting to go to, and Mom wanted to go to an art show, and I guess I was going to go with her. And there was something about, ""Okay, this is the rule: we're going to each do our own thing and we're not going to run into each other."" And so we set off on our bikes, and there was like this booth set up that we were supposed to go see, but we never really.... Oh, I know, she was going to go see her art, and afterwards we were going to do something together. And I was kind of being babysat at a fire station while she was going to look at her art. And they were doing something inside like a show thing and I got to go in and see it. And I was worried about them doing their sirens and this and that, but they said they weren't going to do that for some reason. While I was outside talking to a lady in the back, I heard three sirens, one each had two tones at different intervals, and I told her the intervals that I didn't mind. It was one broader than the usual. I don't know, but it was broader than the one that gives me nerves. So then we went inside and we got to see this show. It was kind of dark and we were all like sitting on the floor. This was this girl, she was playing taps on like a huge bugle thing, and then she had a keyboard that she was playing some jazz on, and apparently she got her right and left hands mixed up because her mother kept saying, ""Wrong arm, wrong arm,"" or something like that. [laugh] And then there was this Indian dance that was like shaking shaker things or something. Then suddenly I was with Mom again, and we were going off to, we were going to find someplace to dance and have fun because it was a Friday night, and I don't know if we ever found a place or not. I seem to remember looking at a menu at this bar place, but it's all I can remember."
"C-061"	"#C-061 (2003-11-08 (18)) Samantha, Sandra, and Lee and Derek and Mickey were in town. I don't know if Lee was there, but I know the others were there. And I had the notion that Sandra was getting married again. I wasn't sure if it was remarrying to Lee, or if it was marrying somebody else, but her and Samantha and everybody were like keeping everything all secret for some reason, I guess they just didn't know, and they were all kind of unprepared. She was just getting herself together. And I didn't really know if I was supposed to be her DJ sound person for her reception or not, and I was going to go over to her and ask her and say, ""Hey, what about your reception?"" because I had to know whether I should pack up the Peavey system or not. And I don't remember what she told me; I think she said, ""I'm still not sure."" So [laugh] that's pretty unsure. And so I packed everything up, just in case, and I think we were in the truck going down there, and Derek was driving, and I was there and there was somebody else, I think it was Mickey in a black dress, and all the other people on a different vehicle. And then I kind of woke up. I didn't think this was important enough to put on here, but then I realized that maybe it is because it kept coming back to me all day today. And I think it came from listening to the graduation footage and all the commotion that was going on in our house that we'd been hearing all their voices again, and thinking about when they were in town and all like that. And I guess that's all I have to say."
"C-062"	"#C-062 (2003-11-12 (18)) I was at our house, but somehow I was in the dining room and our machine was set up in there for some crazy reason.

But Dad was waiting for me to finish something so we could go for a walk or something, and, you know, in real life it's set up so Dad and I have separate logins so that our display settings can be set. Well, I dreamt that in my dream I was so in a hurry, I shut down and I forgot to logoff. And instead of shutting down, it was doing a restart and acting all crazy. And Dad was leaving out the door without me because I had to stay and attend to it. And I think I woke up. [laugh] That was really stupid. I'm kind of wired for sound tonight, can you tell?"
"C-063"	"#C-063 (2003-11-14 (18)) Let's see how much of it I can actually remember. First I dreamt that me and Samantha and Sandra and Derek and a couple other people were staying in this house, like a bed and breakfast, except the owner wasn't there. It was just the place was all to ourselves. And we were doing a bunch of things, I can't remember what, and it was our last night there and somebody warned me that they were going to have to do a fire drill just because it was in the protocol that they had to do it, but that none of us had to be there when they did it because they just had to test the alarm system. So I was getting dressed and I was getting my clothes on really fast, hoping that I could get out there before they actually did it. So I was getting dressed and I grabbed my bags and I slipped my shoes on and I went outside. And I put my bags by the truck, and I started walking down the alley a little ways so that I could be further away from the building, I guess. And I was just standing, when I thought I was far enough away. Well, Samantha, she comes out and she has this red thing in her hand. I guess I thought it was one of the sound emitters from the building [laugh] , and she had it in her hand, and I start running, and she says, ""Oh, smart girl!"" And she catches up to me and she stuffs this thing in my back pocket, and I rip it out and I throw it and I keep running. And she grabs it and she runs after me, and she comes near me with it again, and I ran some more until I was far enough away and then I stopped. And then I dreamt that I was in class. I didn't know if it was Business Law class or one of my new classes for next semester, but I was in class and they were doing busy book work in class, which is very rare, and I was doing mine and I was looking at something that I wrote. I mean, I was looking, I had this paper and it was, it had a big design on the top of an Indian holding a bow and arrow, and I was looking at something that I had printed on it from my machine upstairs here, like I had a printer. And I printed right over the top of this bow and arrow picture, and it was a big, like half a page, picture. And it was something very personal. It was a journal entry about the thing in the last scene about staying in the picture, running away from Samantha. And then I was like in the kitchen with Mom, and I was standing up on this -- oh, wait -- after the bow and arrow paper thing, some girl kind of got a little faint and leaned on my desk, and the teacher came to the other side of my desk and was trying to support her. And I got like smashed in between them so that I could hardly breathe. I was feeling very faint, and I couldn't duck my head and get out from under them or between them or anything. And I can't remember any more."
"C-064"	"#C-064 (2003-11-15 (18)) It was pretty long, but I think it speaks a lot. I dreamt that Mom and I were going to go on this Halloween party boat and we had tickets and she had bought them for $4.99 somewhere. And we were going to kind of slip out because the party went from like 9:00 until like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, so we were going to slip out after he went to bed, and we were going to go. And she was sleeping in my bed here, which really she wasn't, but in my dream she was. And we were talking about, actually I think we were laying on the floor and we were talking about how we were going to go, we were going to go and keep sneaking up behind us. And then I go downstairs and he sees how, I think he heard a lot of what we were conspiring to do. And he picks me up and he holds me and he feels really sorry that -- what should I say? -- I guess that he'd made the image that he had, and something else like that. And I just come out and tell him that Mom and I had these tickets to this party. [laugh] And the party was supposed to be on a boat, and they were like for, they for cheap, and that we were going to go. So we go, and, of course, I was expecting like a big boat and a band and a show and a party and stuff. But this was like, you know at an airport there's a long hall that connects to the plane? Well, in this situation there was a building that was an art gallery, and there was a long hallway corridor that was leading to this square room, and there was a gray rug, and it was supposed to be the boat. This square room with a gray rug was supposed to be a boat, this big party boat that everybody was talking about. So I knew -- and even though it was supposed to happen at night, it was light outside, and the only seats were the ones that we were in. And I get on first because I'm afraid that we're going to be late, and Mom is there looking at pictures and she says she'll be meeting me. And who comes on and joins me, but Dad instead. He like takes her place. And, let's see, so we start sailing, and it's like, they like do something, seal off the engines like they do on a plane, and we kind of shove off from the building with this square room, sailing through the water. Maybe this is because all I see of the plane area is a square cabin, but anyway, pretty soon, when we're sailing, the floor goes away, the glass in seals it goes away, they put some, that orange construction fence around and a board for the roof and just a seat and that's all. And then it stops and we're like swinging around inside of it, there's like water in it, and really not a party at all. But Dad had me dive to the bottom and show me where there some connection made underwater for the sound system, I think, which I don't know why that would be, if there's no sound and no party. But anyway, let's see, I think we go past a beach and Mom just kind of swims out from the beach and comes and joins us. And then I kind of woke up. That was really a bummer because I was expecting to go on this party, but it wasn't. It was just a dumb little ocean cruise thing. I think this comes from the fact that Lib Fest (?) was last year and she and I went to see Swarner (?) and we had a great time. And this year BTO was playing last night, but it was their TV night. That and Third Watch was on. And tonight is Creedence Clearwater Revival and Astrid's coming, but if she doesn't come for whatever reason, we can go, I think. So that's that."
"C-065"	"#C-065 (2003-11-17 (18)) Let's see, how should I start? Well, first of all, I don't know if I was back at Westport High School or still at Westport College, but I had some classes to go to, and I was oftentimes I would go like to the bathroom in between classes. Well, in this one class that I was in, I met the teacher and she said that I really needed to not be late so much because I was getting behind in material. And, oh, this is so weird -- this class was a PE/ Music class. We were going to be like singing, but she said we had to get stronger by doing things like sit-ups and [laugh] lifting weights and stuff. And so we would do a combination that, and I think there were like no more desks and I was like standing in the back of the room, and she was teaching us about theory, and she was showing how chromatic scales are a lot easier to play, but major scales sound better and more complete. And I'm trying to think, I don't remember the examples she gave. This room was like kind of small, but there were like, I don't know, two or three rows with people in front of where I was standing, if that means anything. And this teacher was like a nice woman, she was wearing jeans, I think. And I don't think Mrs. Dougherty ever wore jeans, and I don't think Mrs. Hagerman did either, but she seemed like jeans was like something about her personality that she was more like Mrs. Hagerman, more casual and what have you. But suddenly the scene like shifted, and I was at home and I was fixing some kind of lunch for myself, and I hear this funny sound in the living room and I can't figure out what it is. And Mom said that she had borrowed and brought home a Yamaha Clavinova, not from Dr. Moran's lab, but from this teacher. And she said that the teacher had told her that I was kind of like, kind of bashful about touching it, and she wanted my Mom to work with me with it. And [laugh] let's see, the thing of it was, when you would walk towards it, it would make this funny buzzing sound, like when you first, I don't know, a feedback loop in the lower frequency range, I guess you could say. But it didn't do that at home, I don't know why, so I saw it in the living room and Mom was trying to convince me to sit down in front of it, and it started shrinking and shrinking and shrinking, and before I knew it, it was the size of something for a Barbie doll. And then I woke up. Well, wait a minute, one other crazy twist I remember about this dream: when it was shrinking and shrinking, Mom like took a piece off of it, and I realized that it was chocolate with like vanilla frosting, and that it really wouldn't make any sound if I were to touch it and try to carry a tune. So she cut off a piece of the chocolate from the edge and I had a bowl of ice cream and she just threw this piece of chocolate in my bowl of ice cream. And I really didn't want to finish my ice cream, but I woke up before I could."
"C-066"	"#C-066 (2003-11-20 (18)) At first I wasn't going to record it, but then I realized if I'm going to be true to myself while I'm doing all this psychoanalysis, I have to record it. I can't just portray myself favorably like human nature says we do, because then I'd be calling the kettle black, trying to figure out everybody else's mishaps. So no matter how embarrassing it might be at times, I'm going to try to tell all that comes into my life. I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, and they were kind of planning something for me for Christmas, and come to think of it, we were planning surprises for each other for Christmas. And we had just come back from some beach thing. I think we were coming back from a long walk on the beach that was nice, and we were all riding in this van - Samantha and Sandra and Derek, Nikki and me. And Mom and Dad were there. I sort of like had the notion that they were there because I heard them talk, but some driver was driving us around, like one of my cab drivers. And we were talking about various things, I can't remember what exactly. But Dad was asking me questions like, apparently in my dream he had heard my CD that I had burned from Music and Computers class, which I really haven't burned it yet, and he was asking me questions like, ""How did you do all this stuff?"" and ""Do you know how to play any songs?"" and this and that and the other. And the van driver stopped and we all got out, and we went into this place that was kind of like the foyer area of the Radisson Hotel that we go to for awards and ceremonies sometimes, except this place was carpeted, and it was big and spacious. But I didn't know exactly where we were, but it was someplace fancy and elegant. I kind of had the notion that it was a furniture store because there were couches and chairs and tables and stuff spaced out all over everywhere. And I think there was a staircase off to the side, and it was kind of brownish carpeting. And Dad had me -- think it was Lee, I don't know if it was Lee of Dad -- but one of them had me sit down at this set of keys, like the model we have in school, and play ""Joy to the World."" And I put my hand at the top of the middle C octave, but as I was descending down the scale, like you do in the first line, I realized that the thing was like up sideways and I like, I don't know how to explain it, but it was like instead of horizontal, it was almost vertical. It was kind of like at an angle almost. And after you got down to G, the C octave just kind of disappeared and you had to take your thumb and go along the side of the unit with these ""dup dup dup dup"" things on the side, these little rounded keys after G. F, E, D, C were on the side; they were little rounded things. And it got more and more horizontal and more and more horizontal, and then I realized it was all white, but amazingly enough I was able to play this song perfectly. And Dad was pretty amazed, and he said, ""You have to have one for Christmas."" And he said that this model that we were sitting near was kind of an old-fashioned type of model, and he was in search of one that was, I don't know, like a few generations up, I guess you could say, you know how units are. But somehow I wasn't really supposed to know [laugh] and Sandra -- we were back in the van and Sandra was like, you know how Sandra is in surprises -- she's very good at keeping them. And then -- what should I say? -- down, a little while later the scene just shifted, and I was in the dining room and I saw the manual for the model that I was going to have, and I was going to take it over to the monitor and read some of it. But I woke up first. And that was that."
"C-067"	"#C-067 (2003-11-22 (18)) I was at home and there was this woman who came over to talk to me, and she was an elderly woman like Margaret Henderson, except she was calling herself Mrs. Michaelson, and she was talking like Mrs. Dougherty, so apparently she was a figure that was all of those rolled into one. [laugh] Bizarre, man. And I was sitting on the stairs and she was kind of like laying on the stairs above me and like leaning on her elbow so she could talk to me, and she was saying how it would sure be nice if I could be coming back to Westport High School and attending a chorus rehearsal so that I could be in the concert. And I was explaining to her that I wish I could, but I have college. And you know how people sometimes lay a guilt trip on you and stuff. Well, she was like trying to do that. Anyhow, she had this sweet old lady kind of a voice, and Mrs. Dougherty doesn't lay a guilt trip on people if they're not actually in the group full time, but this woman did. So she was talking to me about coming to rehearsals and all, and I can't remember, but I think she gave me a teddy bear and some kind of diamondy-like Christmas ornament. And I'm trying to think what else. I let it slip away because I went back to sleep this morning instead of record it. A thing with me is sometimes I wake up with a really dry throat and feel like ""bleah...."", I'm in a groggy sleep state, and if I get out my tape machine and record my dreams, I'll sound like really far away like I do sometimes, and I'll be all dry, and you know how that goes. So I think I wait until I'm a little more awake and I'll sound a little more normal, but then I forget half the dumb thing. And sometimes I'm too lazy to reach over and grab this thing, so I guess I'll just have to do that."
"C-068"	"#C-068 (2003-11-23 (18)) I was coming home from school and my driver said that he wasn't going to have any calls for a while, and it was the middle of the day and he wanted to take me to this theme park and I kind of had to say yes. So went there, and he drove me over this great big bridge to get in there. And it was kind of more like a playground than a theme park. They had all of this furniture and things out of wood and they had little play things out of wood, but there weren't really any rides per se. So we were for a little bit. He sat and he waited for me, and I took like I don't know how long, a little while. And then I decided that I should call Melinda and see if she could come meet us here. And she wasn't there, obviously, like she never is. And so then I was home and we were looking at this catalog at dresses and things and Mom was telling me that she had a dream about the chickens, and that they were eating, like they hadn't eaten in two days because of seed. And I went out there and fed them, and they did that for me. There was a white one and a brown one, and they were eating out of my hand like feverishly. And I think that's all there is."
"C-069"	"#C-069 (2003-11-27 (18)) First thing that I can remember is that I was walking down the street with Astrid, kind of early in the morning, and down at the end of 24th Avenue there's 4th Street, and down there at 4th Street there's a bus compound. I mean, there's not really, but there was in my dream. And I could see the buses leaving from the bus compound, and there was a school bus that was coming to the house for me, and so I had to, Astrid and I just ran back to the house to try and beat them, but we didn't make it."
"C-070"	"#C-070 (2003-11-27 (18)) I had a chicken -- Brenna -- and she was like up here in the white bird cage, and I think she was there because there was something prowling around in the yard. And she'd been there a few days, so I decided that it was kind of time to take her out again. So I took her out and put her in the yard."
"C-071"	"#C-071 (2003-11-27 (18)) Dad and I were at the park reviewing psychology, and we found this bench to sit on, and there was this dog that was laying near the lake, just laying there and seemed just exhausted. We threw him some bread and he ate it, but other than that, he didn't want to move. And then these other two dogs came running down the sidewalk, barking and yelping almost in unison. And they were just going over to that other dog, going to terrorize the heck out of him. And I stood up and yelled at them and ran them off, and they had collars, I think, because I heard them clinking. And Dad got up and went off and ran after them and he came back and he said he caught one of them and he had it in a covered box. And he said he was going to report the owner to the SPCA or something. And then I think I woke up. That doesn't make any sense at all."
"C-072"	"#C-072 (2003-11-29 (18)) First I dreamt that Mom and I were at Westport College and going around to my classes, and it was like a holiday, so they had like stands where they had free food. And I was going around with a box collecting some, and Mom decided she was going to take it home. Let's see, they had everything that they were giving away, even little bags of chicken nuggets, and I kind of, I excused myself because I had to go to class. We went out riding bikes and I was riding the tandem by myself and Mom and Dad were riding their bikes, and I was doing all kinds of silly stuff, like spinning around and around and around and around and kind of, you know, like that. And coming up to the point where the sidewalk changed, this is at Oceanside Beach area, and I realized that they had gotten really far ahead of me, and that I should just catch up. And where the sidewalk changed there was this big round cover, and there were a bunch of little ones in front of it. And it was like I couldn't go around it so I had to ______ down and walk over it, and the bike was so light I could pick it up and carry it. And I went until I caught up with them, and Dad had realized that my chain had fallen off, and he put it back on, and by then there was some lightning and thunder. And we were starting to turn around and head back home. Now I have a more vivid memory, and I remember when we turned around and headed back, the tandem was full-size again and I was on the back of it with Dad and we were riding home. And then the scene kind of like shifted, and I was here in my bed and it was dark, and I was listening to the radio, which in reality it didn't come on yet, but in my dream it was on, and it was this techno-y rap kind of thing. And there was this scary techno song that had a s_____ score that goes, ""Dee dee dee dee dee,"" and then, ""Bee bee bee bee bee bee bee,"" and then, ""Dee dee dee dee dee."" And in my dream it was just really scary because it had that interval in it, and so I reached over and I was changing it to something else, that was, I guess, something smoother and easier. And then I realized that there was this person in my bed, supposedly Mom. I had the feeling that I knew who it was. But the person's skin was like wet, and I was thinking how it would be alright to listen to the techno-y song if Mom was there and I could hold her and all, but it was some person, maybe even a doll with wet skin, and so I had to get away from that scary thing and go to something else. And then I woke up and it was light out."
"C-073"	"#C-073 (2003-12-01 (18)) I had a very lucid dream last night, very lucid and very memorable. That is why it's still with me in the middle of the day, because I was too lazy to go get another tape this morning. So that's that. I don't think I'd do as vivid of a description if I recorded it in the middle of unconsciousness, like when I first wake up. But anyway, last night I dreamt that Mom and I were walking home from someplace and we were talking about getting Dad this vintage collectible fire truck, remote control activated thing, for Christmas, you know, like the things Derek used to have. And we were saying how great it would be because it was nice and painted, and I had the notion that he collected fire memorabilia, but he doesn't -- Quinn does. And so we were talking about getting that for him, but then I realized that when you make it back up, it does this stupid back-up alarm sound and that wouldn't be good. So we decided not to get it for him. But, you know, he got it for himself, and I kind of had the notion in my mind that he had agreed to -- I guess play with it while I wasn't home, kind of like I blast the sound system while he's not home. But anyway, in amongst all that ruckus I dreamt that I was watching a Celine Dion Las Vegas concert on Mom's TV in her room, and I guess I think I remember watching her sing a song of some kind, kind of like a _______, something in Latin, in a black dress. [laugh] And then the pace picked up a little bit, but instead of singing, for all her dancers and cast, she was like suggesting fashions that would look good on them, going around and giving them these clothes to change into. And this one girl got pants that were slightly longer than the shorts of the others, and she asked why and Celine politely put it that her thighs were a little big and she needed something longer to make them look prettier. And I don't think that went over too well with the girl. And then, in the middle of the TV thing, I heard Dad's fire truck thing that he supposedly got for himself in my dream, outside. Speaking of back-up alarms, there's two of them going at the construction site across the street, but they're not the scary kind. I don't know if this will pick them up or not. They stopped now. But anyway, I heard his thing that we supposedly got for him outside in the back yard and I had the notion that he was running it in the dirt, and I couldn't see it, and it was going, ""Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"" and I could hear it from inside, so I was kind of like in a panic. And I went in my closet and I closed the door, and I sat and I covered my ears, but it was still the same level, in fact it was coming a little closer and getting a little louder. And he was even running his belt sander to cover up the sound so I wouldn't hear it, and it was still audible to me. And, you know, in real life that wouldn't be true. [laugh] But soon after I woke up and I realized it was all a dream. [laugh] They've been advertising the Hess (?) truck, you know, that they do every year on pretty much everywhere I've been listening, so maybe my subconscious was remembering the little truck that Brittany had that would make that crazy sound when it would back up. And Brittany was sensitive, though, she wouldn't do it while I was around once she figured out that it scared me. In fact, she was trying and trying to turn the sound off of that thing. And I think I was combining those two. You know, I don't know, I think that it's one of those crazy things that just comes up as a figment of the imagination. I don't think it means anything. One more thing, while I was cuing up a VS tape to record ""American Dreams"" last night, there was a Celine Dion Oprah Winfrey interview preview thing, and she was singing, and I had to put the tape on fast forward, but I wanted to watch the picture, so it was like, ""do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-ahhh."" [laugh] And I guess I was imagining all kinds of crazy things going on as I was watching the elaborate Las Vegas show go by really, really, really, really fast. And I think that's it."
"C-074"	"#C-074 (2003-12-03 (18)) I think I had a dream about walking into outer space last time, but I'm not really for certain. I'm not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we're in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth's gravitational force. And it's like, this doesn't make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you're out of its gravitational force, but I guess it's the orbit that I'm thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free. So that was a messed up dream with nothing to it, I guess."
"C-075"	"#C-075 (2003-12-04 (18)) I had kind of an interesting dream last night, but this is one that I don't really see the sense in yet. I dreamt that I was working on DP or something to that effect. It was some other kind of program that was kind of similar, but instead of just being in my studio here on the west wall, my machine was set up on a little wobbly table inside my closet, and I only had a little bit of elbow room one way or another. And the light from the monitor kept it from being too dark in there. And somehow I had a little bit of some kind of sound system in there. And [laugh] I'm trying to think now, what happened. Oh, I think before any of this I had lent my machine to Terri, I mean the whole shebang, the monitor and everything, because hers is one of those all-in-one things and hers was down and out for whatever reason, and she had this paper thing she had to finish for her job, and so I lent it to her. And she brought it back to me and was setting it up in my closet like I needed it to be. And, let's see, I didn't feel claustrophobic in my closet. I felt okay, and I seemed to be content in that little mess. I was still a little crowded out, but I was okay, other than that. And I can't remember much else. Oh, I know. The scene kind of like shifted all of a sudden, and I was in the church, and instead of listening to just eight or ten magical singers, I was listening to this great big, huge choir singing and accompanied by an organ. And their songs were all right, but they weren't that impressive. Things are never as impressive as they should be in dreams, for some reason. Whenever I would dream of opening presents, usually they're like boring things. And things are just usually not as exciting in dreams as in reality. But maybe that's for the fear that they won't be. And that's all I can really remember. I think the thought of working comfortably in my closet relates to the fact that I think I would be just fine if I were by myself and nobody knew, like what I was doing or how much time I was spending on one thing, and I was just working along at my own pace, twiddley-dee, twiddley-da [laugh] . And I guess lending my machine to Terri is something kind of literal. I wrote the Christmas wish letter for her, and hers is like so old, running always 8.6, bless her heart, she can't even get online. And I've offered that if she needs to run around on a faster platform, she's done enough printing for me, she should come over and run around on a faster platform for a little while. But I guess that's just some crazy thing that entered my mind."
"C-076"	"#C-076 (2003-12-05 (18)) I was first, and most prominently, even though I think it was last, I dreamt that I had to go back to Westport High School for some reason, I didn't know why. But then I went in this office that was kind of dark and it had several layers in it, like it had several steps down in places, like the sound both at Memorial Stadium. And I realized that it was the VE Specialist's office and I had to talk to Ms. Coombs. And I told her that I'm not back here to take any more academic classes. I've already graduated. I'm back here, I think it was to take chorus class or something, which I guess that would be explainable because I'm working closely with Mrs. Dougherty and I'm volunteering at Westport High School and I have one of Westport High School's volunteer ID's. And then Ms. Coombs finally got it and then Mrs. Hollander came up, and I was practicing speaking Spanish to her, and I was telling her that Mom will be there with her painting on Monday, and different stuff like that. And from what I remember about what I was speaking, it was correct grammatically. And, let's see, what else? Oh, before any of that, I was here in my bedroom with this really long tape that was given to me like in the four track format that the Library of Congress records in, and it was this kids' cartoon tape about different historic events that happened. It was about Christopher Columbus and his Spanish friend that came to America, and they were just being real goofy and silly on the tape. And I was trying to get to the part, I guess it was the other side of the tape that was talking about reading music, and Mrs. Dougherty wanted me to listen to it. But there was so much of this Christopher Columbus goofiness that I didn't get to the other part. I can't remember too much more, but I have this vague memory that me and four other people were in this crowded little store like an antique shop, but we were practicing singing in there. We were each dressed up as a different character, which they were last night, and there was an accompanist there kind of leading us. And we sang something and like everybody started crying, and I didn't and I was wondering what was the big sad thing here. I couldn't figure it out. And I think that's all."
"C-077"	"#C-077 (2003-12-11 (18)) I had a dream about sound last night, and now I've just got to remember what it was. We were at this place like Scenic Point or Becker Park, and they were having this kind of little festival thing with cupcakes and different little craft booths and different things going on. And there was this little area only reserved for VIP's and only VIP people could go there. And it had this little orange net fencing surrounding it, you know like they do sometimes at blockade sites. Well, there was a gap in the orange net fencing and Dad was putting bulb (?) and just ___ back there. We didn't know it was only for VIP's and we didn't have a pass, and once we got back there, everybody was very accommodating to us. And we went up on this deck and we saw like some sound equipment, like a couple mike stands and a couple amps and mixers and things laying around. And that was pretty cool, but then the deck was like the deck of like a house or something that had a door on the front, like the front door of a house. But when you went in this front door, it would be like really, really dark with only a little window at the top. And it was a narrow hallway, and it was deep. I mean, I should say it was a deep way down from the deck to the floor, and there was a window up high. The doors had windows in them. And the window light reflected against the wall and it looked gray. And we go down this tunnel. Well, first of all, in my dream I like was in a hurry to get in this door because there was a lot of sophisticated equipment in there, or so I thought. And I think this is an important part of the dream. And I went in the door and let it close behind me, I was so scared and petrified that it was so dark, that I opened the door and I waited a few minutes for Dad to come with me. And he came with me and we, it seemed a little lighter when he was there with me. And boy, I'm using up tape like crazy here. Why I can't stop stuttering and la la la blah. Oh well, anyway, it seemed lighter when he was down there, and there was some kind of a sound system in there that had a couple of subs that went, ""boom, boom, boom"" with some kind of rap beat, you know how it goes in those big cars? Except it wasn't that intense; it was about the level of mine, but it was just kind of isolated and not a whole lot of highs or anything else. And I thought, ""Hey, that's cool,"" and I had a feeling like it was like a testing site. And went down this hall and we came out. It led into like a nice little shop thing, and this shop had everything from like candy canes to little ornament ball things, to baskets of goodies and stuff. And I had a feeling it was like somebody's house, but it was a shop too, and there was a lady there that was real nice and kind and accommodating to us, and gave us something, I don't remember what, from her kitchen table, something like a sample to eat. And then we went out the door and we were back at the Becker Park place, and Dad said, ""Want to do that again?"" and I said, ""Yeah."" So we stepped into the orange fencing, we went up on the little deck, I saw the equipment up on the deck, we went down in the little dark tunnel thing with the subs that were booming and went through the lady's little shop, and, hey, that was fun. It was like a round, round, round circle. We did it a couple times. And then I had Astrid with me and Dad, and I was leading Astrid up onto the deck and down into the little dark tunnel thing, and the tunnel thing seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it. I think that's symbolic. And this time I was leading Astrid through it, and I lead her, she wasn't scared at all, of course. Well, even though she couldn't see, she knew it was kind of dark in there and cramped and tight, and she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And then I led her into the shop thing, except it had transformed this time, and not only was it that lady's shop, it was like somebody's bedroom. And we were like snooping in somebody's bedroom and they had a whole stack of CD's and stuff, and Astrid was wanting me -- and all of these CD's were new, they were wrapped, like the shrink wrap. And Astrid was telling me, ""Tell me what this one is, tell me what this one is,"" and some of the titles I could read and some I couldn't. And just before I woke up, there was this CD that had the cover of like a green spider web, and it had white lettering on it that said ""50 cents,"" you know, like the rapper guy. And then I woke up. Man, that was something. And, you know, it's evening time and it stayed with me the whole day. Isn't that amazing! But I think this is kind of symbolic. In the past I have had a few dreams about a roundy-roundy-round circle that just is continuous, like, for example, I had a dream one time that a cellar went down into a sub-cellar that led out into a, like a netting tube that you would go up and get in the attic. And when you were in the attic, there would be a whole bunch of stuffed animals and it would be kind of hard to breathe in there. And you would have to fight your way through tons and tons and tons of stuff in order to get out of there. It was kind of like Mom's attic is. And then you would be in the house, and that was a circle that involved dark and scary places. Now this circle had a dark and scary place, but it was only one, and it involved sound, which makes me think about life when I analyze this. The fact that the tunnel seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it, I think has to do with experiences that are new and odd and scary. They seem easier each time I have the same experience, and I think the first time that I went in there when I was so scared and petrified and I waiting for Dad, I think some experiences are like that. I am afraid to do them on my own, and even though he's more critical and slower and harder, I want to have somebody help me through them. And I think the lady's shop symbolizes like a house, like almost being in a home-like environment. I don't know, I'm drawing a blank there. But the fact that I had Astrid on this round circle thing with me, I think is that I think I've had enough in the sound industry that I can start leading Astrid through it. And that's all I have to say for now. My throat is dry and I've used up enough tape. Another thing I thought of, I think the fact that we started out that an event at Becker Park or Scenic Point and going in that VIP section and people not minding us just barging in there has to do with the fact that coming into the sound industry in all this stuff, I started not knowing a darned thing and being at events like that, at public places, and wanting to go behind and wanting to just jump over those stupid fence things, and wanting to go talk to the people and they never really minded it. And that, inside the VIP fence is like inside another world. And I think -- I don't know if this circle was about life, or if it was about the other world contained in the sound industry, or whether it's about both. I don't know, but that's that."
"C-078"	"#C-078 (2003-12-14 (18)) Was kind of involved, but I only remember bits and pieces of it now. First I was in a group of singers, a special little group that Mrs. Dougherty had put together, and we were practicing singing, ""What Child Is This,"" but somehow nobody else sang and I ended up singing it like a solo. And she was saying ""Good job"" to everybody, even though nobody else sang. That was funny. And I think we were getting some kind of stage ready for some kind of performance. We were deciding who was going to be where and what we were going to do. And then she took me aside and she asked me, she told me that she knows how to read music on a staff, but she wanted to know how do you read music in the form of mini data in an arrangement window, you know, like with the vertical keys and the lines and the grid and stuff. Well, that's what I was going to teach her how to read. And I was going to write a little book on that at home, but I was having a tough time finding some paper. And there were some other things going on. I think somebody wanted me to hurry up and get out of the house with them to go somewhere, and I didn't have time to make this book. And just before I woke up, I was writing out part of it. I remember something else about this dream now. This was a really important part. I don't know how I could forget. I dreamt that the phone rang or something and called me away from what I was doing, and I had to leave my computer like at the desktop, the Mac. And I ran to the phone and got called away, or something, and when I came back, I found Dad sitting in my chair getting into my folder of word processing, all my journal and stuff, and just reading. For some reason he sized the window down to a little tiny, tiny thing and he was just reading, and he said, ""I see you _____ a word processor here. Why would you be doing that?"" And I'm thinking, ""Ahhhh, this is the death of me!"" And I finally convinced him that he shouldn't be looking at that, that that's a private thing, and somehow I didn't need to give any more of an explanation. Then some older lady was working with me and she took me online to get something, I don't know what, but something audio that was playing through the task scan, and somehow she shut me down without getting me offline, and usually in the world, you just automatically get offline when you shut down, if you don't already. But I was all up in arms that I hadn't been disconnected from the line, and so she had to start up all over again and get me offline and shut down. And I don't know what happened after that."
"C-079"	"#C-079 (2003-12-16 (18)) We were babysitting that girl Brittany from the Barrett's house and she's kind of an immature kind of blah kind of person, and she had this program, you know, like they give out in the theaters, that kind of program, for this ________ concert that I'm supposed to go to for Christmas. And I asked her if she could tell me what the date was that the performance was going to be, and she didn't really know how to count; she kept getting all mixed up. She kept telling me, ""26, 25,"" and I kept telling her, ""I think you mean 12/25."" And she's like, ""Oh no, it says here 26, 25."" Wonder what that can mean? And she was opening it up, and for some reason it had all these stickers in it and her ticket, and I don't know what the stickers were for. They were like hearts and flowers and teddy bears. And I couldn't really read the date; it was too small. And then I went into the kitchen and there was this thing sitting on the counter, and I picked it up and I thought it was a piece of chocolate. And I took a little taste of it, and it was lipstick, and I was like, ""Bleah!"" And I've never really done that, so I don't know where that came from. And then I was coming out to ride the bike with Dad, and I had this dress on that came to my mid thighs, and it was really cold, but I had this dress on. And I don't know why, and I was going to ride the bike in this dress. And that's all I can remember. I think I woke up after that, but I don't know."
"C-080"	"#C-080 (2003-12-17 (18)) After my exams were over and I was in my last meeting of Electronics class, Mr. Martenson kind of really like surprised us and said that he wanted to take us all on a trip to the beach and stay there overnight, and so that we could look at the sunset and the wave length and the frequencies of light and how they change. And I was really surprised that we were going without any further notice, without any bags, without any anything. [laugh] And so the kids in the class didn't really want me to go because they were afraid that I would get lost, that I wouldn't know where I was going and what I was doing, and stuff like that, like I've always had to deal with. And I was just kind of bull-headed and assertive and said that I've been to the beach lots of time with my family and that this will be nothing. And so next thing I know, I was there and we were all sitting around and talking and I was swimming with them in the water. And we just kind of swam around and I guess we stayed the night; I don't even remember too much. But when we got back to the house, it didn't even look like what I'm used to. It was this big, fancy, ornate lobby which they're known for and I had to get something out of his class, so I had to go upstairs. Oh, for some reason we were sitting in his classroom that was more like a living room, and it was dark and we were just all talking about the trip and what a wonderful time we had. And then we all went out and I was kind of going in the opposite direction of all the people and waiting for a minute or two because there was this whole table full of candy. They had like big dishes with lids on them, and I'm sure that anybody could just go in there and get some. But then I kind of lost interest. They hung around and they hung around, and I figured I had to get home and I think at the time I had the cell phone in my pocket, and I turned it on in case they needed to locate where I was. And they had this -- it must have been three stories, but it was real open and each story had real high ceilings -- and there was this roundy roundy round, real narrow staircase, just about my arm span wide. So I was hanging on, each hand to a railing on each side of this running down these stairs and spiraling around and around until I finally, I didn't even get to the bottom and I heard them calling my name on the intercom. And I couldn't really say anything or yell out that I was on the stairs or anything, and the office was right in front of the staircase. And the office had clear doors like the Learning Support Center does. And I can't remember actually reaching the bottom, but I remember being in the office and meeting up with Dad and not knowing what was going to happen after that. And then I woke up."
"C-081"	"#C-081 (2003-12-21 (18)) First I dream that, in addition to my three classes out at Westport College, I was taking a fourth one here at Westport High School, like a dual enrollment thing. So what I was supposed to do is go to Westport High School, be at that class from like 7:20 to 8:00 o'clock, then go out to Westport College and be at the next class by 8:30. So this class was taught by Ms. Burley, which was the teacher that I had my first semester of the 9th grade, and she was strange, bizarre, bland, and I could never figure her out. She taught critical thinking and learning skills, which was a really boring, stupid course. But in my dream she was teaching that class again, and I had to take her class at the college level, and it was like a dual enrollment thing, I guess. And Melinda was there, and I think I went to the first class, but I didn't go to that class any more after that. In my dream I only had three classes at Westport College and I only went to those three classes. And in my dream I had no idea what my classes were at Westport College, and I got a notice in the mail and a little card that had my exam score from Ms. Burley, and I had gotten a ""D"" on her exam. [laugh] And I was thinking to myself, ""Now gee, I don't even remember taking that exam. I don't even remember having that class, so what's up with this grade?"" Then I remembered I had the class, but I skipped it, all but one day, and I didn't take the exam. And then the scene kind of changed and I was at this picnic party that I think was at like the remote park like Lake Hiawatha, and we were -- it might have even been Clementine Springs, I'm not sure, but we were by some water and it was kind of a nice even temperature -- not real cold and not real warm. And there were trees around and there were picnic tables all over everywhere. And it was somebody's birthday. And there was this guy I knew who was kind of like my best friend, and there was supposed to be Melinda's family and some fireman people in the neighborhood. We were going to all get together for this man's birthday. Anyway, I had the Peavey system. Where I got power for it, I don't know. Don't ask me. [laugh] But anyway, that wasn't an issue in my dream. It was just supposed to run. And, let's see, there was a birthday cake, and here's the funny part: I had borrowed Astrid's keyboard because somebody was going to play and I didn't know how to, and it was set up and connected to the Peavey system and this guy was just jamming away, whose birthday it was. I didn't know who he was. And then I went off to do something else. I think I was running streamers from one tree to another. And then, before I knew it, I was back at the guy, and the thing turned into a cake. And I'm thinking, ""Oh, my gosh, what's Astrid going to say?"" [laugh] That was crazy. And that was a cake and everybody was cutting up and having a piece. Oh geez. And then the scene suddenly shifted and I was at this movie theater setting up the Peavey system there. There was supposed to be some kind of screening of some kind, some kind of VIP party, and things were really, really running late and it was kind of like I was going to be sitting around for the next few hours waiting for people. And then I woke up. That was a strange conglomeration of things. Also another funny part as this dream was ending and I was waking up and fading into consciousness and coming to, I thought back about my classes at Westport College, and I was thinking, ""Could I have really gotten that grade on that exam or what here?"" And I couldn't remember any of my classes. I had to think about when was my lunch hour. Then I remembered I had Electronics class, then I remembered Music and Computers class, and then I woke up a little more and remembered Psychology, but I couldn't remember the first one. And it wasn't until I was like fully awake for a few minutes that I remembered, oh, it was Business Law, which I was a little doubtful of how I was going to do on that exam, so that might be where this dream got started. Also another part of this dream could have come from the fact than when I interned at Memorial Stadium, during the baseball games they'd have all kinds of corporate plugs, people could win things and advertise a corporation. And Sam Ash Music sponsored a happy birthday thing for every game, and they would tell the birthdays of famous people. And they would show the organist's fingers playing ""Happy Birthday"" and then suddenly the picture would materialize into a birthday cake with a Sam Ash Music picture on it, so that might be a seed of that thought."
"C-082"	"#C-082 (2003-12-22 (18)) I had three classes to go to and that they were in the afternoon. The first one started at like 1:00, and why I keep dreaming about having to go to classes, don't ask me. I'm sick of dreaming that. But anyway, my first one started at 1:20 and it was like 1:16 and Mom was sitting at the dining table just writing and stuff like that, and I was telling her, ""You should go get the truck and bring it around. I'm going to be late for class."" And she said, ""No you won't; you'll be fine."" But it got to the point where I was shaking her by the shoulders and yelling and crying, telling her to get moving because I was going to be really late for class. And it was kind of hard because I was just screaming. And I can't remember, but I think it was like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" kind of blah. Then I was in this party room with these people and it was supposed to be something like a dance performance thing. It was going to be filmed on live TV and I was just kind of in the audience with the people. And it was a small room with a kind of a wooden floor, and it was, I think it was for the show ""Fame"" and I had the notion that ""Crispen"" won it last year--who the heck Crispen is, I don't know. And I was going in and out this room and going to the bathroom and few times, and then I came back and I was sitting around with people and they were talking about what they were going to do. And this one girl was doing some homework and needed to use bright (?) calculator, and it was really acting funny and we couldn't figure out why. And then suddenly I was, it was Dad out at this little tiny building that I guess resembled the church that we had the party at, but it was more like a movable portable facility than that. And we had to go there for some kind of business, but I wasn't real keen on going in there because I had heard that their alarm system was real unreliable and could pretty much go off at any time when somebody so much as shook the place the wrong way. And so I stood back a few feet while they opened the door, and things were okay in there. And in my dream I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't want to because I was afraid that sitting down on the toilet and going would either make the alarm off or I would be lucky enough to be in there when, just happen to. So I didn't, I kept walking around for a little bit, doing different things, getting stuff ready for some kind of event. And I finally went to the bathroom, and then I woke up, and I had to go when I woke up."
"C-083"	"#C-083 (2003-12-24 (18)) I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something. And we were in a band room and we were kind of being taught by a man, but instead of rehearsing or stuff, we were talking about Greek mythology and we were talking about how to go around and take the path and the journey to find Theseus (?). I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And Mom was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and Mom was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn't yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He's the cab dispatcher. And, oh, Mom was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don't remember ever getting there. And before that, I dreamt that I was investigating around by the tree, and that I had a longer, a box that was longer than it was wise and kind of not that high, and heavy and dense, and it was wrapped in green paper. Now I don't know if this is a prophetic image or if it's just wishful thinking, but I tend to believe it's just wishful thinking. And now I don't remember any more."
"C-084"	"#C-084 (2003-12-27 (18)) I was attending this special school for like handicapped people, I guess because they were an institution known to do a lot of help for people and make a lot of things go well for people, and so they thought it would be good for me to go and visit them and see what they could do for me. And, believe it or not, it was like this private school, K-12, and since this was my first year with them, they put me in a first grade class. [laugh] And I went to this first grade class for like two days, I think, and then I realized that this was not just a health institution that would try to help you. This was a school that they were going to try to put you through their twelve years of education no matter how old or young you were, and how many you'd already been through. And then the scene kind of shifted, and I was like, I had a place that I had, somebody had given me. It was like a dinky little apartment thing, and I was living on my own. Actually I was living on my own part of the time and living at home part of the time. And I was in this dinky little apartment getting some work done and stuff, and I called home and it was like 5:00 in the evening and Mom and Dad were like, ""Where the heck are you? If you're going to leave the house, you tell us first."" They didn't even know I had this place. And then I was, I think it was the next day, and I was going back to this place, I was going to bring them my high school diploma, show them that I had already graduated, show them that I was in college now and disconnect myself from them. So I went in the office and I had my high school diploma, and I chatted with the ladies; they seemed really nice. And I just told them, ""I don't wish to take any more classes here. Thank you."" And I walked out, and I showed them, and they seemed so impressed. I couldn't figure out what were they so impressed about? And I think shortly thereafter I was kind of in the phase of stage 1 sleep and waking up, and I was thinking how, I had the notion that the campus that I attended now of Westport College was really called Panella's Park High and it just had facilities for college students in the back forty, kind of like. But when I was fully awake, I realized that I was still attending Westport College. How come I keep having dreams about these educational conflicts? I keep dreaming that I'm back at Westport High School or that I'm not really where I am yet, I think because it's still for me to even believe."
"C-085"	"#C-085 (2003-12-29 (18)) Mom and I were coming home from a trip to Jackson and we were outside the airport and Josie and Bobby and Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and her and I were opening gifts. And the plane was like going to leave in five minutes. Then it came down to that we missed the plane because we were opening gifts, and I figured, ""Okay, we're just going to have to stay in Jackson for a few more hours until the next outgoing flight."" And that was kind of good because we could go to somebody's house and stay a little longer. Well, it just so happened that -- I know this is very unrealistic -- but Dad drove all the way up from Westportrsburg because he somehow found out that we missed the plane. See, we were going to tell him that our flight was cancelled, but somehow he found out that we missed the plane. And so he drove up and he was going to get us and bring us home, and he was mad, mad, mad at that old red hen, hen, hen. [laugh] And we also missed the Bryan Adams concert and I was jumping up and down and saying that, ""You have to take me to an equivalent one."" Something else, but I can't remember. And that's basically it. When I was waking up and realized that all this was a dream and that missing the plane was a dream and the concert was still on, I was real relieved."
"C-086"	"#C-086 (2003-12-31 (18)) I had the notion that I was interning at some kind of TV station like Time Warner, yet it was kind of like the Dome at where I was. And I think it was, I couldn't really figure out what it was, but I was in this control room and I had like all kinds of video equipment and a small like mixing board in the back. And there were like this real crowd of people in there. I couldn't figure out who they were, but this one guy was supposed to be the manager and his name was Derek, kind of like the guy we missed at Whitaker Hall, and there were a couple of guys that I thought I know, and there was a whole bunch of people that I didn't even know that I was kind of wondering why the heck were they there. And we were supposed to get this show on the road, and I was supposed to help somebody with something. And there were about four or five people crowded behind the board trying to do all do the same thing at once. [laugh] Gee, where have I heard this before? And, of course, I was just kind of sitting in a little corner observing all this commotion and ruckus going on, and then I kind of faded into another scene where I was walking down the sidewalk and I had to go through an obstacle course. And I was trying to tell somebody about my experience when I was going through an obstacle course. And one of the things I had to go through -- I didn't really have to go through anything but this one thing. In front of Jean's house where she has that fence, white picket fence, it kind of came out to the sidewalk and enclosed and made a box, and I had to crawl in the box and they close the door and then open it on the other side so I could get out. So when they closed the box, it was so small and tight, I could barely like move through it, and there was a top on it like I was in a bunny cage. And then I came out the other side of the bunny cage and I went on my way and I was okay. But when I was in the bunny cage, I thought I'd never get out of it. I think this came from when I was like 3 and used to sit in the bunny cage and feed the bunny, but I never used to mind because I could get out from the inside."

But anyway, it was either -- I think it was a cross between Westport High School and Oceanside Elementary. And I was skating on roller skates through the hallway, I think because I was just there to kind of help out with something. I wasn't really there to actually go. And I can't remember too much except I was in PE class again, and we were doing jumping jacks out in the courtyard thing."
"C-088"	"#C-088 (2004-01-02 (18)) For some reason we were going to a baseball game, but I wasn't going to like do any DJ'ing or anything like that. I was going to like sit and watch the game, and we were hoping that I could like sit in the press box and go to the sound booth or something like that. And we were describing who we were and Mom just casually mentioned that I graduated from high school. And the lady whisked us and said, ""Here, let's put you in the graduate section."" And there was like a VIP area for people who had graduated from high school. And she took us off down this little hall and brought us in this little booth. It was kind of like a sound-proof booth. And they passed out -- there were like five of us in there and there was one lady. I was sitting up on a high stool so that I could actually see down and out the window what was going on. And, of course, I couldn't always see what was going on in the field, but I could see all the people in the bleachers and stuff. And this lady was like in her 70's, and she was like, ""Can I trade with you?"" And so I sat on the far right, down on the lowest stool I could, and I couldn't even see up above the window. And she sat in the middle in between like the five of us. There were like three boys and only two girls. And she passed out like snacks and little prizes to us; it was like complimentary things that came with being in that section. And we were supposed to get to hear all kinds of like inside stuff, but they didn't send it over our system. Ours -- and get this -- this was the craziest part -- the system that they had us hear did not carry the songs that, the periodic songs and announcements that Bobby mixed, and apparently we were just supposed to watch the game without sound. And they played teenage rap and R&B stuff over the system that we heard. And that was crazy. I wanted to hear Bobby's mix. And I was thinking about how, when I was there at regular games in the sound booth, and I got to listen in on him talking about what to do and when to do it, I missed hearing all that because that was like really the inside scoop, the ultimate inside scoop. And, of course, to be able to coordinate it to listening to Bobby's mix and looking at the monitor when I could see what the video person was doing. And also there's another part to this dream that I remember. Before any of that, I dreamt that I was having a sleep-over birthday party with Astrid and Linda and Darlene and one or two other people from the Wilcox Center. I think Frieda must have been there too. And I think we had like just woke up and we were going down to have breakfast. For some reason Linda and me and one other girl were sitting on a towel eating in front of the TV. And Linda was bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me, like she does, about letting her go into my studio and make a copy of a CD. And [laugh] she wanted a copy of like Ace of Base and now that I think of it, I don't know why the heck she would want that one because she doesn't like that kind of stuff. But in my dream that's what she wanted a copy of. And I was thinking of how, when Mom gets breakfast on and everyone's eating breakfast, I'll just run up there, make a copy real fast and bring it down and give to Linda so she'll have it and I won't have to have her mess through all my stuff and everything. And then when I got in there and I was sitting down to make the copy, I realized that I didn't have an original, and therefore the STMS was going to scream and yell in my face, and so I had to put in my personal CD player and do an analog. And that's when I kind of woke up. [laugh]"
"C-089"	"#C-089 (2004-01-07 (18)) I don't know exactly where to start because this was another one of those rambling saga-like type dreams, but I'll start at the part that I can remember the best. I dreamt that -- I think this is where it starts -- I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn't know if I was at Westport College or Modern Media College, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who's the sound engineer, great. He's left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hollander B3 organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his 70's. He was kind of in his 70's or 80's and he kind of barely knew what he was doing. [laugh] And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn't getting much out of it because I couldn't see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play like chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was like bad, to say the least! [laugh] He was like, I don't know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn't know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn't go with anything that was going on. And then, I don't know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that Dad and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don't remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember -- this is kind of crazy, man. I don't know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It's one of those things where you think it's going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don't know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it's there, and we were like getting settled and stuff and we're ready to take off, and I'm ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it's the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And [laugh] the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie [laugh] , that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that's bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man -- as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don't ask me! [laugh] But it's becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla's favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don't know, it's called ""Farralene"" (?), it goes [singing] and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it's not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don't know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess."
"C-090"	"#C-090 (2004-01-08 (18)) I know there was more to it, but this is all I can remember so far. First of all, information: sometimes when the chickens get elderly, they get kind of in poor condition, and some age better than others, I guess, just like people. But in my dream there was this white chicken and Dad wanted to wash her off on her back side because she was really getting messy. And so he was going to, he wanted to see if I could hang onto the chicken for him, and he was thinking of putting her in one of the like a harness thing, like you would a dog. And I said, ""I don't think so. I will hold the chicken with my arms and keep her from getting away."" And so, sitting on the picnic table with the chicken, she's white, but she kind of has the build and weight of a Rhode Island Red, and they're kind of hard to contain because we only have one left, and she's a red Rhode Island Red, but for some reason in my dream, she was white. And I'm holding the chicken and he's dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dallying around, and I can't figure out why. And then I say that I need to, I realize that it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven't had lunch, so and the chicken looks hungry too, believe it or not. So I tell him that he should hold the chicken for a minute so that I can go get some seeds. I went inside and got a bite of my plate and I was kind of disappointed because I was smelling fried food in the chicken, but what I got was only a baloney sandwich. Then I came back out with some seed for the chicken, and I guess that kept her busy for a few minutes, and then we continued the operation. And he was telling me how bad she was looking, how it looked like she had a ton of bacteria and stuff because one time one of our chickens was like in bad shape. And then I think we were done and I let the chicken go. And there was this truck that was going by that had sirens on it and back-up alarms going forward, and I like fell to the ground and rolled over and laid there until it passed. And I can't remember anything more."
"C-091"	"#C-091 (2004-01-12 (18)) We were up in the territory of Modern Media College and I only had like two or three days, maybe even two or three hours before I started classes there. And we were like outside in like a park area, and I had to go into the building to use the bathroom, and I needed to ask the counselor and the secretary for a calendar of like time off and stuff like that. And so I went in this like real just blah building and it was like the lady who came out wouldn't let me go any further until I showed her my ID and I could prove that I was going to be a student in a few days. And I dreamt that there was this man counselor that I knew that she directed me towards that I had a feeling that I had had a real technical discussion with before, and that I felt real comfortable with. And he wanted to know if I had decided what kind of mixer board was best for me, and I told him I hadn't yet. And I got the calendar and I went back outside and then I woke up."
"C-092"	"#C-092 (2004-01-13 (18)) I don't know if this is all going to fit, but I'm going to try. Last night I had a dream that I was at this theme park, and I can remember bits and pieces of it. Bad me -- I let it drag on until it's 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon now, but I didn't have time to record it this morning when I first woke up. So I dreamt that I was at a theme park with Melinda, and it was kind of a school field trip like type thing. And there was this ride called the Kumba Roller Coaster -- it was either the Kumba or the Montu -- it was kind of like Six Flags. And we'd go on this roller coaster and we'd roller coaster around. It would be an ""Ahhhhhhhhhh!"" thrill ride. There was also this ride that I liked that was a slide that would like spray you with water as you were sliding down this big, tall slide, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you were going by, like it had a really neat sound system, which that and spraying water just don't go together, but maybe they did. I think I heard something like that at some kind of theme park, and that's where I got the idea from. And once you got down to the bottom of this big slide, you'd fall into this swimming pool that was really deep and you like swam to the other end, and that was okay. And we only had a little bit of time left, but I wanted Melinda to go on this slide with me, and she said, ""No, no, I'm too chicken; you have to go by yourself."" And so I went, but it was kind of funny because the slide wouldn't spray me with the water and there was no sound. All that it was, was that you could slide down the slide and that was it. And I imagined in my dream that this slide was pink and that the pool was pink, instead of blue like they usually are. And so, sorry folks, the tape is coming to an end. I will start over on the next one. Alright, I don't expect this tape to last me more than about a month's worth of material, maybe even less, but it's just a junky marketing tape anyway, and it's no good for anything else, and this is better than having it thrown in the garbage. So, let us begin! I am going to start over and repeat a dream that I wasn't able to fit on the last tape. It is now close to 9:00 o'clock at night and I am kind of fortunate that even part of it has stayed with me this long because I just didn't have the time to do it this morning. So anyway, I dreamt that I was at this amusement park, and I was there with Melinda, and it was kind of like Six Flags, except in my dream it didn't really have a name. And we were like on this school field trip and her and I were kind of running around together, and I think everybody else kind of just ditched us. And we were like running around going on these rides. There was this huge, open park picnic area in the middle of the park that kind of reminded me of Westport College Quad, except that it had like picnic tables and stuff and like amusement park type fencing and white-colored tables. And there was this one ride that was like the Mod II or the Kumba, and it was just a roller coaster. You would have to walk up very high to get to it though, like a boardwalk; you'd have to climb stairs and go up ramps and snakes and winds, kind of like you have to do when you're at a theme park, except this was all in the open and on a like a wooden boardwalk. And I wanted to get Melinda to go on that, and I think maybe we did, but I have no memory of actually being on a ride. Then there was this other ride that I really, really liked supposedly, and it was supposedly a pink slide that you would slide down and it would spray you with water from the side, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you'd be going by. Now spraying water and a cool sound system don't exactly go together, but, you know, in theme parks sometimes they may have everything all water-tight. And I was trying to get Melinda to go down this slide with me because we only had a little bit of time left and I wanted to make us do this before we had to go. And the slide was pink and I went down it; she was too chicken. And it didn't spray and the water and it didn't make the sounds. It was just like a slide, because I think the park was like going to close, but I didn't feel like it was. And then I like landed in this pool of water, like you would expect at most theme park rides, slide things, and when I first landed in it, the pool had a pink bottom instead of a blue bottom like they usually do. And then as I was swimming behind this other girl, and I became aware that I was swimming over like a grate venting and my feet were about to touch the bottom, then the pool turned blue like they usually are. And you know how in dreams when you dream about swimming, or at least I do, the water like tosses you around and you like, you sink to the bottom as though gravity were holding you down, but you can still breathe by some miracle? This is how I always dream when I dream about swimming in a pool. I don't know why. Usually the water wants to pull me up because I'm a female and I have the female fat buoyancy thing. Dad just sinks like a rock. But anyway, I have to really fight to get down and stay down if I want to dive under water, but in my dream I just sort of sink and I can still breathe. [laugh] But anyway, enough of that. And so, I don't know how I got myself like all dried off and everything in such a hurry, but we went back to this like classroom that was at the theme park and there was a TV, they were going to show a movie. And I was kind of thinking, ""I want to sit where I can see the movie,"" because I thought it was going to be halfway interesting, but Melinda said, ""Nah, nah, let's sit over here in this section where we can goof around and nobody will see us!"" And it was close to one of those like candy machines that they have at Westport College. And before anything else could happen, I woke up."
"C-093"	"#C-093 (2004-01-16 (18)) I had kind of a typical dream, something you would expect from somebody who has a class that they're going to the next day. I was dreaming that I was up at the right time and all and waiting for the cab, but instead of the cab coming for me, Melinda and Chelsea showed up at the door, and Mom and I got in their van thing, and we were riding along and Melinda and Chelsea decided to take us to Mr. Denton's house. Mr. Denton was my economics teaching in my senior year that, I don't know, he thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all his kids were really kind of ""blah"" anyway, and so was his class. And so he thought I was just so intelligent and so wonderful, but anyway, we went to Mr. Denton's house and they took a bunch of pictures. And he still had his Christmas things up. And we, I was looking at his little village scene set up things and they were really cool. And then we went to the beach, of all places. And we bummed around at the beach, and we were talking about various different things, I can't remember what. And then finally they decided that they were going to take me back to class, and I got there in time for Speech class, but I had totally skipped Ethics class. And I was trying to persuade Mom not to show the pictures from Mr. Denton's class to Dad because he would know that I skipped Ethics class. And I think Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to go somewhere and they were going to come back for me for lunch, but I woke up before any of that happened. Oh, and I dreamt that I was real afraid because the cab people were going to say I was a no-show, so they'd automatically cancel the return trip, and so Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to come and get me and we were going to go have some more fun after my class. And then I woke up."
"C-094"	"#C-094 (2004-01-18 (18)) I finally got the gift that I had been wanting for some time. And, you know, I've been having these dreams. So I finally had it, and it was finally in my closet and I was so proud. And Dad was going to help me set it up in my sound studio, but first I had to learn how to flush the toilet without making it clog up. [laugh] And the trick of it was you had to hold down the handle until just after the stuff had made it down, and then let it go immediately after that. And if you didn't let it go, or you let it go too soon, the whole thing would be for naught, which for real life, in both of our toilets, we have to hold it down, but it's not the end of the world if we let it go too soon. So a couple, I tried it like three times, but it didn't really work right, and we had this big Jacuzzi like tub in the upstairs bathroom and Dad had to take a dream clog stopper out of the tub to kind of let some more air into the pipes, I guess. That was crazy. And, oh my gosh, there was a big flash of lightning outside. But anyway, I can't remember what happened after that, but somebody was going on a plane somewhere. I think it wasn't going to be Mom and I going up to Jackson. I think it was going to be Dad and Mom going somewhere, and I was finally going to get to investigate my gift. And I woke up before any of that could happen and realized it was a dream. If I keep having all these stupid dreams, I'm not going to know the real thing if it does happen. [laugh]"
"C-095"	"#C-095 (2004-01-20 (18)) First of all, I think the first, I had a lot of elements that were real fragmented, now when I think about it. But I think I laid through a lot of stage one, just kind of half conscious awareness from 5:30 to 6:00 this morning, so that's how it got all fragmented. But some elements that I can remember first is that my application into Modern Media College I was pretty sure was going to be rejected for some reason, and I had kind of resigned myself to the thought that I just can't be in the sound business because my vision prevents me from doing some, perceiving and acting socially, and I think I move around too slowly on some of the programs and there's no way in the world that I can operate these big huge mixer boards. Now this is all what I'm thinking in my dream, as I'm standing in this yellow room with big boards all over everywhere, almost like our kitchen is now, except it was huge like a warehouse. And I was just standing there thinking, and I had the feeling like there were like tons of people around me, but nobody was saying anything, I didn't hear anything. I was just thinking all of this. [blowing noise] Ummmm, a big blob of snot! Anyway, now that that's out of the way, then the next scene that I can remember is that I was at home. It was like the night before I had classes, like last night was, and I was sick with some kind of cold or flu or something, and I was laying on the couch with Mom and we were kind of almost asleep. And I was singing to her. And I had some kind of thing where I still couldn't go to sleep and I had to get up and take some kind of medicine, so she got up with me. And we went in the kitchen, which was kind of normal, the way it used to be, and she had me take a few pills by drinking down some water and taking them. And then she gave me applesauce that had like peanuts chopped up in it, and I think I ate it and it was good, and as I was eating it, I woke up. [laugh] That was kind of crazy, but I think this is a very telling dream that brings out some of the inhibitions that I have and this subconscious fear that I have, that no matter how hard I try, I'm not going to be capable in this field. And even if I were to realize that, I would be just devastated, and I'd probably be like a societal hermit for the rest of my life. At this point I don't know what else to do with my life. I know that's bad, but it is, it's true. And I guess I've been thinking a lot about going away. I've already started a little box of stuff, and I practiced filling out a practice application on last year's, in last year's catalog, and it slipped down behind my bed. And I figured, ""Oh heck, it's just last year's scrap copy anyway; it doesn't matter."" And I even had a duplicate in my catalog, but I think that might have had something to do with it."
"C-096"	"#C-096 (2004-01-21 (18)) Astrid and me were at Westport College together, and we were in this office waiting to see our degree program advisor, and I had the feeling it was supposed to be, I was already seeking an audio degree at Westport College. And I can't remember the exact title, but I remember thinking in my dream back to an experience that I felt kind of inferior, when we were in a class, kind of it looks like kind of at Modern Media College with a huge mixer board, and there was this one guy who was doing most of the work in the hands-on learning. And the other five or six of us -- there were like ten others of us -- and we were just standing there watching. And I figured, ""How am I ever going to learn if I keep going at this rate?"" [laugh] And so I was thinking about that when we were sitting in this office. You know how they have the U line, the queue thing? Well, it was dark and they were playing a movie for us while we were waiting because we had to wait like forever and a day. And then I think I had a memory that I was going to ask Uncle Robert if he could lend me his copy of ""A New Day Has Come"" because it was in surround sound, and I was just dying to hear the thing mixed in surround sound, which in real life the truth of the matter is that I saw it in a collection of others in Sound & Vision. And whenever I listen to it, I think, ""Man, would this be great mixed in surround sound!"" And so I was going to borrow it from him and play it on his sound system, since he had a SA CD player, and I think when we were standing in that office waiting for that guy, I was like crying about something, I don't know what! And we were supposed to like, I don't even know what we were going to say. I didn't even know if we were going to see a man advisor or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Ms. Maggot from Stephen King's memoir, and I think I was going to see somebody like her. And so then I dreamt that I was at Uncle Larry's house -- how I shifted to that scene, I don't know. But instead of being at Uncle Robert's, I was at Uncle Larry's house and I was going to play ""A New Day Has Come"" in surround sound, but somehow I woke up before I could do that. That was kind of dumb, wasn't it?"
"C-097"	"#C-097 (2004-01-23 (18)) One other note about this dream -- first of all, it kind of scares me to think that I came in at the top of the building and I went down. If that's going to be how my career's going to go, that's a ""Pppppppt!"" But anyway, the path and elevation is that I came in at the top and I went down and around, and I helped somebody while I was down. Then I went back up and I felt really claustrophobic and tight. And one thing about that little attic space that was supposed to be a recording booth, there was nothing in it except a toy teddy bear and a party hat. Now tell me what that's about! [laugh] But anyway, there was no sound board or anything; it was just a toy teddy bear and a party hat. And then I went down, and I went outside, and then everything seemed to be going good outside. So I don't know what all that's about. Also I didn't taste any of the little desserts and things that were laying out, but I looked at them, so I think all this could be pieced together in that maybe when I get to the very top of my career, somebody's going to act really immature and keep me in a very tight, confined, pretty conservative little area, not physically, but mentally. And then when I get a little more space and I'm a little more established, I'll be outside feeling good and bold to do anything I want. And understand that all of this is what my mind is seeing, it's not necessarily, I don't believe, that these dreams are saying psychic things about this is what's going to happen to you in the future. It's what my inner eye sees, or thinks is going to happen to me. It's nothing guaranteed, so that's my take on that."
"C-098"	"#C-098 (2004-01-27 (18)) I was taking this music class on Saturdays from 10:00 to 11:00 at Westport College, and it was kind of put that way loosely because we could go whenever we wanted. And it was supposed to be so that it could be getting credit without actually interfering with the rest of my schedule. And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it's kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It's really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I've been listening to, I think that's just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot. And I dreamt that Merrilee was involved in all this because she was kind of the music teacher's assistant, and they were holding this seminar on a Saturday, and they weren't sure who was coming. And I said I was coming, but I didn't know about anybody else. And that's pretty much it, I think."

"C-100"	"#C-100 (2004-01-28 (18)) And then I went back to sleep and had a dream about Modern Media College. I dreamt that, first of all -- this is the crazy part -- I think I've been watching too much TV -- there were these four or five people in my room that were kind of talking to us and all, and there was this one boy who wanted to see my DP program because he wanted to learn to mix too. And I said I'm going to come back and show it to him, and I went and told Mom. These four girls were the ones they weren't sure about. Apparently I had the notion they had been discovered in a room that had a meth lab underneath it. Oh, my gosh, I don't know what's up for that. But after that scene I was at Modern Media College, which really I started off being at Westport College and I sort of found myself there at Modern Media College, and it was a real maze. I came in with Mom and Dad, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And Mom and Dad kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I didn't taste any of the treats; I don't know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I -- oh, before that -- this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six-channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, ""Oh thanks, they belong here."" And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and Mom and Dad were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, ""Nobody can get in here like this."" He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I don't know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos [?] and finally I brought up my master a little. And I went back to my seat and then I woke up."
"C-101"	"#C-101 (2004-01-29 (18)) Dad was in my studio surfing the internet on my machine for some reason, looking for gosh only knows what. And he was on the phone talking to somebody and I thought that he might have brought up one of my journal entries from my folder full of stuff, and so I just kind of said, ""Dad, I'm sorry, but this is time and you have to move, you have to let me close this out."" I closed it out and underneath it was the website that he had been looking at, and next thing I knew, I was sitting down in the chair and he was on the phone talking to some relatives. It was like I was listening in on a conversation almost. And I wasn't really on a website for any purpose; I was just exploring it. And apparently it was like a, you know the front of a Christmas cherub's (?) box that was real kind of crazy colors? That's what the theme of the website was for some reason. And I was kind of thinking, ""Okay, I can do a search on the internet for anything I want."" And shortly after that I woke up."
"C-102"	"#C-102 (2004-01-30 (18)) I was at like a fair thing with Mom. I can't remember if Dad was there or not, and I think that Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry were in this somewhere. Oh, and I think Merrilee was there. Mom and me and Merrilee were walking into this little park thing. It was kind of like a scaled-down Six Flags, and we walked in this path of flowers and little animals in cages and stuff, and then at a certain fork in the path, there was this sign that Mom read to me and it said, ""Piggy Zoo Zoo."" [laugh] And it was kind of funny. Mom said that we're going to have to go into this auditorium, and we went in and we were seeing this like play. And Mom met up with Dad and Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry, and Merrilee kind of disappeared. And they went and sat in the seats in this play, and I stayed behind and I sat at a table in the back of the theater facing the wall, meaning that my left shoulder was facing the stage and my right was facing the door. And I was in this little entrance way hallway and I was facing a wall to the right. And I was doing homework, and I was listening to them doing their play while I was doing my homework. And for whatever reason, I had this tape machine. I think I was listening to like notes I took from class, like if I had recorded a lecture, and I was like listening to that intermittently, and get this -- the main actor onstage came off the stage, came all the way back to where I was and said, ""Excuse me, Ma'm, but you cannot be taping this for any reason at all, any reason."" And so I was really embarrassed and I shoved it in my bag, even though I wasn't recording, but then I can't remember a whole lot after that. I think we were listening to this play some more, and then we went out and then we came back to like a hotel room. And Dad was there and we were talking about something, I don't remember what. And then I woke up."
"C-103"	"#C-103 (2004-02-01 (18)) First of all, we had our PC over on the desk in the foyer like we have, that kind of squarish desk. Then for some reason on the roll-top desk we had a Mac in addition to mine upstairs. Now I think that was because somebody who went to the school system regularly needed to print out grades, and they had to print out grades on this special perforated paper that would only print in that kind of a printer. And so in my dream I had a solution to my writing dilemma. I would compose my stories up here, then take then down there on a CD and print them there because the printer would take perforated paper or regular paper. And the roll-top desk in my dream was like a huge, grand and stately thing. And, you know, I don't remember a whole lot else. Let's see, you know, it's a bummer. I don't remember anything else that happened, but what I can say is that I did a lot of typing for an ethics report yesterday and reading, Mom did a bunch of reading and I had the system on while I was doing a lot of this. And when I would look up to kind of rest my eyes, I would see, I would be looking at the desk from like right up next to it, and so it would look really huge. You know, all the shelves that are up there; that's what I'm talking about."
"C-104"	"#C-104 (2004-02-02 (18)) I was going with Dad to this big expansive, empty parking lot to take the Peavey system and practice my speech. And he said, ""Okay, we're going to leave in a few minutes,"" and I realized I didn't have my personal CD player or any of the other accessories that I need for here to give my speech. And so I figured it would be better to delay things and make them wait a little than to get there and be totally unprepared. So I took a paper bag and I dropped in my personal CD player, the mini disk recorder, some cables, my wireless mike receiver and the wireless mike itself. And then I was thinking, ""Okay, I'm ready to run out the door."" And then I realized I don't have the XLR cable to connect the receiver to the board. The wireless mike receiver connects to the board with an XLR, and I realized I didn't have that so I had to dig it out of my drawer. And also I realized I had to dig out the transformer that powers the wireless mike receiver. I had to look in a few places and finally I found it and I threw all that in a bag and I was running out the door, and then I realized it was dark out. I had taken most of the day to get this stuff ready. And each time I would put something in the bag, I would turn and run out the door and, I mean, out of my door and halfway down the stairs and realized that I had forgotten one more thing. And I'd come back and I'd put it in and I'd run down half the stairs, and then I was, ""Oh, I forgot one more thing."" And by the time I was all done with it, it was dark, and we just decided that we would go tomorrow. And then I woke up. [laugh]"
"C-105"	"#C-105 (2004-02-06 (18)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Lee and Nikki and probably Jason were all in town again and they were all in our house. And it was like they had all flown in and I think Samantha and Sandra and I were visiting, and I think we took a walk around the park and everybody but Samantha ran ahead, and Mom and Dad and I and Samantha were on this walk, and I was -- see, this is a dream within a dream again. I dreamt that I had this dream that Connor had given me like a miniature guitar thing as a souvenir from his show; not a real one, but, you know, like a, I guess like a little refrigerator magnet, hang it on your mirror type of thing. It was like on the end of a graduation tassel. And I dreamt that I was telling all this to Dad and Mom and Samantha. And Dad was like, ""Now, what would be the point of that?"" And we couldn't convince him because it was a lack of facts. And now that I think of it, I don't think that would be something that he would really think bad about, but in my dream he did. He was going on about, ""What would be the point of that?"" And why in the world would somebody do something like that? But then again, in real life he's always doing insane things that I'd never guess he would, so I guess that's where that would come from. And then suddenly the scene shifted and we were at home, and it was like bedtime because it was like 9:30 or 10:00 at night, and, you know, we think it's bedtime, but they go on hours into the night. So this is the crazy part! Samantha and Sandra and Derek and me and Nikki were all going to sleep in the same bedroom downstairs, the master bedroom, with Mom and Dad. They were all going to sleep in the same room! [laugh] And I was going to be up here all nice and peaceful and quiet and everything. And for whatever reason, I took out the mermaid doll and I shoved it under my pillow for some reason, and I was getting adjusted and I heard them all jumping up and down and screaming, laughing, having a good time. So I figure, ""Okay, I'm missing something, so I'll go down there and check it out."" And Samantha and Sandra and the guys were kind of wrestling. I don't know where Mom and Dad were, but then I realized that I was totally naked and was probably embarrassing everybody but Samantha and Sandra, and I said, ""Oh, fashion, fashion,"" and they covered kind of my chest. And Sandra took each of my hands in hers and spread them all wide and kind of showed me to them, and was like, ""Yeah, fashion!"" [laugh] And that was okay because, of course, it was Sandra. And so then I came back up here again and Sandra and I kind of talked about what, I do not know. And then I was resting again, and then I could overhear Mom was in her workroom and Samantha was in there talking about how bummed I was because of what Dad said about my dream thing. Oh, and Derek and Louise came up here because they wanted to listen to some news in the bedroom, and it didn't work, so they asked if they could turn on mine and I saw, ""Sure."" So I moved over to the left side of the bed here and I let them sit down on the right side, and I think Nikki was there too. And my radio turned into a TV and they were watching TV and they were watching TV, and I figured, ""Alright, I'm going on the couch."" So I went on the couch, and that's all I can remember, and then I woke up."
"C-106"	"#C-106 (2004-02-12 (18)) Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were in town, and Uncle Charlie was listening to my mini disk machine because I was like showing it to him, and there were some audio files on one of the things there that he was listening to. And for some reason I was going on a website that I could look at the results of the Top 40 countdown, and the songs were listed from like 40 to 1 and they had these little icons next to them with pictures that were supposedly the pictures of the CD covers but really had nothing to do with the song. I think that comes from like in Word documents and things, you have a list and you've got these big icons and list information, and it's just all over in your face, which is how I like it. But that's the way it is. I was doing that, and I kind of left it there because I had a feeling that he was going to want to see it. And then I went out in the front yard where they were, and I discovered that Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were then sitting, laying in this like silk tent in our front yard. They had like pillows and blankets and sleeping bags and stuff in it, and they were literally camped out in our front yard. And I couldn't figure out why, but this is the really crazy part -- Uncle Charlie had these butterfly stickers -- not really stickers, but laminated pieces of cardboard with shiny hologram butterflies on them and birds and all kinds of crazy stuff, pictures of bicycles and birds and cars and just stuff, and they were all squares the size of mini disks, and he could slide them into the mini disk player instead of lifting the lid with the latch. He would slide them into to this like a slot, and he had this like projector thing in his pants, and he would hold the unit so that the front of it could send an infrared signal to the projector saying it would project it on a screen in my pants! And he was looking at jpeg pictures and seeing these crazy hologram butterflies up on the projector thing, and hearing audio files too, not just through the player, but on a sound system in there and stuff. It was crazy! And then I think I woke up."
"C-107"	"#C-107 (2004-02-14 (18)) I had a crazy dream about DBS mainly, which is kind of crazy because I never dream about them. But first in this dream I kind of had the notion that I was riding with Dad in the truck in the middle of the night with my bag of stuff and the Peavey system, and we were going on a long, three-hour trip to do a DJ gig somewhere, but I don't actually remember doing the gig. I don't remember coming home, I don't remember where it was, I just know that I was sort of getting ready. Then Mom and I -- I think I do remember getting home from the gig and Mom had to take me to the DBS office to pick up some paper, and they had this big, huge complex, not just a little office in a big building, like they have. And so we walked over there when we got there, and we were just going to pick up the paper and leave, but Carolyn wanted to talk to me. And somebody else did too, so I can't remember anything about what I said, but I think I said, ""Hi, hello,"" to Carolyn. And then there was this other person. She was kind of younger than Carolyn, but she was a little more kind of uppity like, just a little. And we were going around, I don't remember why, but she gave some kind of direction to Mom. They had this like field area out in the back that was for mobility training, and she wanted Mom and I to walk to it. And it was like a street, like a city street, with like just empty fields and nothing on either side. And how that could be anything big for trade, I don't know. And so we started walking down this road and I realized that there were these -- every so often in certain places, there were these like cover things, but they weren't covered, and half was silver and half was black. And when you would step on them, you would get an electric shock because apparently they wanted to do like conditioning to keep you in the middle of the street. And ever so often there would be one on either side, and if you stepped on it, I guess the silver half was the positive and the black half was the negative. I don't know, you'd have to be between the two of them, because you know how that goes. I think I had my white cane with me that time, and even when it would, when my tip would touch it, I would feel it through my hand, which I don't know why because my tip is plastic and the aluminum part is really insulated really well by the rubber top. I don't know, I guess I just wasn't thinking when I created this dream. And so we were going along, and at first I didn't mind, we were walking along and it was kind of pitch dark and we could see where the street was, but sometimes they'd have them in the middle of our path. Then they got to the point where they weren't just every so often. They were like all over, and they were getting bigger with more voltage on them, so it felt stronger. Mom still didn't mind them, so then she was carrying me over some of them, and she was getting them all and she was going, ""Ooh, ah,"" but she didn't mind them. I was like petrified and she kind of didn't care. And there was no like turning back around and going back because this path was like a circle; it would lead you back to the building. We got back to the building and we had to go upstairs for some reason because there was a bathroom in there, and they had you take a shower after you've been on this trip, if people have any feet yet, if they're not black yet. But, you know, the really wild part, after we were on that trip I noticed that there were a few here or there inside the building, and so by that time I was like afraid to take any step in any one direction because these things, I didn't know where the heck they were and when they were going to pop up. And in some cases, when we would be in the hallway, they wouldn't be there, and sometimes they would just pop up, except in the building they wouldn't be black and silver; they would blend in with whatever was around. And so I never did take my shower as prescribed, but I had to go up and down the elevator, which wasn't just for anybody to use. Somebody had to specially activate it for us, so we went down the stairs a few times too, and we noticed how steep the stairs were. So Mom and I had to make a sign that said, ""Beware, drops off."" And I was kneeling on one stair and laying on the other, and there was the most awful smell on the stairwell, like gym sweat. And somebody was coming up beside us, and I moved over and left them pass, and I finished my sign and then I stuck it up there. And then we went down the stairs, and then, thank goodness, that fiasco was over. Then my dream continues though, we met up with Dad at the Coliseum and Mom and Dad were conferring outside and I went in and I was giving our information to the person at the desk, like how old am I, how old is the person I'm with, this and that and the other. And it was more like applying for, applying for some kind of government aid just to get into a dance. And the guy said he had a check for me because I had made that long trip and did a Peavey system gig. And so it ended up that I didn't have to pay to get into the dance, but he paid me for something. And so it turned out, just before I woke up, me and Dad and Mom, we sat outside in the lobby and were eating some kind of lunch before the dance really got started. Now what I don't understand is when I was on the DBS mobility trail, the ________ mobility trail, I don't understand why it was totally dark outside and here at the Coliseum it was broad daylight. Oh well, that's one of the aspects of the dream. The next dream stems from a lot of things, the first thing being that I always have had something inside of me about covers, but they've always either just popped up or sprayed water or something. I've never had anything electrical going on. I think it's because now, whenever I handle the Peavey system outside, I'm conscious of it. Even this last time I practiced my speech, I was on the sidewalk and everything was dry, and I was still feeling a little bit of something. So I put on my shoes, and, of course, the fears went away, but still I'm more conscious of that now. And also I don't know where DBS comes into the picture; I guess because I'm becoming more independent lately and some people just don't know how independent I can be, not them, but some people I know. And we had to fill out a long, lengthy f___ application so the guy at the Coliseum desk asking me all those question fits in just fine. And he paying me for a Peavey gig is, I guess, because I got several scholarship checks in the mail, and that's the end of that."
"C-108"	"#C-108 (2004-02-15 (18)) I was like riding in a cab with somebody and I got out at this like dollar store where I was supposed to meet Mom. And some guy in a tuxedo came and knelt down like to the side of me and grabbed my arm with his hand. And he looked me in the face and he said, ""I'm going to make a deal with you -- you come with me and I'll keep your secret quiet."" I guess I kind of like bit his hand and he let me go and I went in the store. I was supposed to meet up with Mom and I never did, and then I met up with her eventually. And then the TV people, some news people were calling me because they wanted me to go on TV for half an hour and talk about what had happened. Somehow that got misconstrued, and instead of that we were going to talk about what it was like for a local girl to be in the snow for the first time, and that was really silly. And I don't remember anything else in this dream, and then I woke up."
"C-109"	"#C-109 (2004-02-17 (18)) There was something going on before, but I don't remember what it was. All I remember now about this dream was that I was having my whole room, my studio, repainted, and not just that, but we were having the kitchen and I think the stairwell and the studio repainted, maybe even Mom's room. And some things were all messed up and turned upside down and messed around, and you know how it is. And I was in my room here, and they had just finished repainting it, and it was twice the size that it usually is, I think because when we were repainting it when I was 16 just before my birthday, we did repaint it, and it was like, it looked twice the size when all the shelves and everything were out, and my desk was out because it was being repainted. And anyway, I came in and they were starting to move furniture back in, in my studio after the paint job, and my desk was like big and black and the top was wooden, but the bottom was like plastic, you know how modern things are. And on my south wall there was this cart with like a ton of books on the bottom and a ton of CD's on the top, and it was like real ____ and said that it came from like a friend who was cleaning out the closet. And I could go through their CD's and books and keep any of the ones that I wanted for like DJ stuff. And so I started looking through them in a very orderly manner, and I laid a few on the side that looked like good party mixes that I was going to put on and listen to once my sound system was back together, because only furniture, but nothing else, was in there at this point. And then Dad came in when I had like two or three laid aside, and he was saying something like, ""Do you think you can put all this stuff back together?"" meaning the sound system and all the equipment. And he said, ""Then after you do that, you can resume and maintain your privacy,"" or something like that, and I said, ""Sure, I think I can do that."" So even though it was like a monumental task -- not only the sound system, but the mixer and the computer and everything was like all, all the components and everything were just laid out on my bed. And he was like, ""I think that attempt is going to fail. I know it's going to fail."" And then I woke up."
"C-110"	"#C-110 (2004-02-18 (18)) I had to take three more classes at Westport College this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that Dad had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can't remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, ""Oh Shenandoah."" And he was also, he knew ""This Land is Your Land,"" and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, ""Wow, isn't this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing."" And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don't know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching Dad play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and Mom was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I've still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it's an online thing. And that's pretty much it in a nutshell."
"C-111"	"#C-111 (2004-02-20 (18)) I was in this kind of semi-dark house with a tile floor, and there was a stairway like ours and there was a light on in the stairwell. But I was sitting like on a wooden chair in the middle of this living room floor, and I was babysitting this little boy. And he was like jumping up and down on the couch and stuff, and I think there was a coffee table over in front of the couch, like in our living room. And, like I said, it had a tile floor and it was kind of semi-dark, but there was light coming in the window and there was light coming from the stairwell. And this boy -- he'd come over to me and he would lean on my leg and, well, how do I say it? He would get himself hot from that. And then he would go back to jumping up and down on the couch, and I think he would do it over on the couch too. And in my dream I wasn't really concerned or embarrassed. And then his mother was there, and I was sitting on that chair on his mother's lap, and he was still running around, checking over things and jumping on the couch and coming back and doing the same thing.

"C-112"	"#C-112 (2004-02-23 (18)) First, the first little theme part was that somebody was pregnant and they didn't want their baby, so they somehow transferred it into Mom's body, and I guess she even acted like a mama duck sitting on her eggs. She was sitting there in like her flowing robe singing, ""La La Loo,"" to help the baby grow, and I had to harmonize with her if I wanted to help create the baby. And so I did, and I saw in this particular scene she was on a little chair on the upstairs landing. And then, jumping to the next scene, we were on this boat and it was all dark. It was like a semi-big like private sailboat or something, and it had these tight quarters inside the cabin, and we were going up to the second floor of the cabin for some reason. And something was wrong with the boat, and in order to get it repaired, the man who was out on the boat with us had to go up to the second floor of the cabin, which you just kneel and you couldn't stand up in the second floor of the cabin. And he had to lay down in this bed that he could just barely fit in, meaning because it was so tight and so low. And there were these bright lights that they had to turn on inside this little bed cubicle, right on the man. And this lady had to ask him questions about what was wrong with the boat under these bright lights and then she could finally fix it. But while this was going on we heard a big boom down in the lower part of the boat, and we were like, ""Oh, my gosh, we have to get off."" And I was wondering if I could out of the upper floor of the cabin because it was so tight, and somehow I managed to get onto the deck. And then I woke up and I was having little dreams about us being in the kitchen listening to Bryan _______."
"C-113"	"#C-113 (2004-02-24 (18)) Have you noticed how when I record with this unit in here, it sounds a certain way, but when I go into my studio, the walls, there's less stuff to absorb the sound and so the acoustics are different in there. And in the last entry I used my Mom's boombox because this one was downstairs because I was using it for my Spanish lab stuff. And so it was just different, and I just think it's so cool, the way you can tell immediately, if you know your units, which one you used and where you were when you did it. It's obvious I'm using my Mom's boombox again because my hand-held one's down by the CC TV and I was using it for Spanish. Last night I was dreaming that I had to take all my equipment up to Jackson, not just my mixer and my CD recorder, but my receiver and a DVD player and everything. It was like I was going to be really weighed down. And I think it was because somebody wanted me to do a gig when I got up there or something. And so I was setting things up in the living room on a little table as kind of a test run, and I had the mixer and I had a VCR that I had to connect to it, and I also had my CD recorder, and I also had, I think, a DVD player. And I was trying to figure out how in the heck was I going to connect all three of these things when I already had two sets of RCA inputs, and I could use adaptors for the other one. And I think either my cables weren't long enough or something, but I had to do a little switching around. And then I was nailing down and explaining to Dad what the significance of having a, like a surround sound system is with DVD's and stuff, and then I woke up. That was a very obviously literal dream because we're going to be going here shortly."

And Derek was just kind of sitting there like, ""bleah."" I think we were in the bedroom. Oh no, Samantha and another girl and me and probably Derek were up in the bedroom up here, and we had the twin beds, like we had in the old days. I had the notion that Dad was picking up Sandra and Lee from the airport. He called home from the cell phone to say that he was coming soon, but our land line rang with the same ring tone that our cell phone rings with, and that was really weird because I was all confused. What else? Oh, in this dream I had this feeling like even though Samantha played the joke with me, I felt closer to her and Derek than I did to Sandra and Lee. And I think it's because she's so distant and she hardly ever calls or writes or anything. She's kind of like estranging herself from the family somehow because she thinks we're not going to accept her for who she is. And she's having all these problems and she wants to hide them from us because we're going to say, ""We told you so."" So that's why in this dream I got the feeling like I wasn't really as close to them, but on that regard, I kind of feel a little hurt at times because I'm her sister and she can't even talk to me about it because she knows that I'm connected to her father and she thinks I might tell him. She never said any of this, but it's just obvious. And I don't remember anything more."

"C-116"	"#C-116 (2004-02-28 (18)) I was in the Media Center of Westport High School. Now we know the Media Center is the building that is pretty much open air except for the classroom and has a really icky stupid elevator. [laugh] Well, in my dream I was coming out of one of the classrooms of the Media Center and I was racing down the like hallway on the second floor to get to like the stairs or the elevator so I could get down because somebody was waiting to pick me up. And part of the building was under construction, and in my dream it was a lot bigger than it actually was, and I was running down the hall and I came to this little metal gap, like, you know, how you get gaps in concrete, so I kind of stepped over that. And then it was like an obstacle course. There were like rubber mats, little pools and things, screws, there was concrete that was all torn apart and several layers and levels that I was stepping down, instead of just going down the stairs. I came to this area that there's a monument at the Scenic Point, that's like a point in two triangles touching each other, and well, this building under construction had one of those and I was standing underneath it, and I was standing in a puddle of water and I was starting to see lightning. And I thought, ""Oh, my gosh, I'm standing in a thing that's metal and I'm ankle deep in water. I'm really scared here."" I wasn't hearing any thunder; I was just seeing flashes. And so I climbed onto, you know how when you do construction, the windows aren't in and you've got like big gaps, I jumped onto one of the window gaps and I was sitting where the window was supposed to go, yelling for help from one of the construction workers. And I had the feeling that one of them was coming to get me, but instead, Mom showed up with the car. She pulled it right up into a dirt mound, got me, and I woke up before we could go anywhere. And that's that. Well, for one thing, I've been having a lot of stress lately, and it seems to be going away now that things have evened off, but I've just been having tons of emotional roller coaster rides, I guess you could say, because I've been really, really, really happy one minute and either tired or disappointed about something the next. And I guess before things started evening off today, I was feeling like I wasn't sure if I was going to get all my stuff done on time. So that could be where I felt like I was in such a dangerous situation portrayed in the dream. Now the other things are just kind of things that played in there, like the construction is still going on across the street, and fortunately I haven't had to go snooping in there lately. Let's see, I don't think there's any buildings at Westport College that are like the Media Center, but there is an icky elevator in the Language Arts Building that I don't really have the nerve to go on. I never thought I would be like that until Melinda brainwashed me into being afraid of elevators that aren't quite right. And, of course, we know about Mom with the car. She's the knight in shining armor once again because she's going to take me off to a bunch of fun things real soon, and she always comes and gets me out of these things in real life, emotionally more than physically. And that's just that. [laugh]"
"C-117"	"#C-117 (2004-02-29 (18)) I was having a really neat dream last night, one of the best organized, I think, that I've had in a while. Usually when I have dreams about birthday parties and Christmases and opening presents, everything is real vague and kind of distant. That's kind of one of the reasons immediately I know that it's a dream because it is so vague and distant. But this time I had a dream that I was having an early birthday party with Samantha and Sandra and Derek, so that we could celebrate with them before we went to Jackson, we could celebrate up there, then we could celebrate when we get back on the actual day. And for some reason Samantha, Sandra and Derek have been showing up in my dreams a lot lately. And we were in the living room and I was opening some presents. The first, I got some books for my birthday, meaning in my dream, and I can't remember exactly what they all were, but one of them was, it looked and smelled like the copy of A Tale of Two Cities that we got from the library, but it was some other French title by some person. And it was supposed to be one of the most profound things in literature, but I was like, I don't think so. Then I got this other book from Dad that was like a small, about the average size of a paperback, but a little thinner, and it was supposed to be this quarterly journal like type thing about sound and stuff. And it was kind of brown and old looking, and it had yellow print on the cover that said, ""How to Take Amplifier Wattage and Apply It to Speaker Power,"" I think is what it said, something like that. And I'm thinking, ""Okay, do they have to have such a thick volume on such a topic? I mean, not just stuff in general, but specifically that. And I started flipping through it and it was tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny print and there was a subscription card in the back, and I was thinking how it wasn't a really a big deal that it was in tiny print because I have a CC TV. And then I got the biggest present of all. Now in my dream all these presents were wrapped in the same kind of wrapping paper, that kind of like rosish wrapping paper that I used for Mom's TV. This present was so big that it could pass for a piece of equipment, you know, like the average size that the average box comes in that you get? Well, it was that size and I ripped it open, all excited, thinking it was going to be something like that. And it was a box, a gourmet box of chocolate-covered cherries that was just huge. I was feeling kind of a little bit let down, but yet a little excited at the same time because I was kind of expecting something else. [laugh] And then as this dream goes on, it got really cool. The mermaid doll that I have, you know how it just duh duh duh duh. [laugh] I don't know what I'm saying, but you know how that is. Well, I dreamt that I found the little bag that it came in and there were these magnets, like refrigerator magnets, that you had to install, like you had to glue them to the battery compartment door so that either to make them hold the charge longer or to make them do something else. I think it was to make them do something else, but these could have not been magnets. They were either magnets or chips that you had to glue in a certain place on the door, and I was trying to figure how to do this and I didn't know if you were supposed to glue them to the door or the side of the thing. So I was trying to find the instructions to figure that out, and there was this big, thick book that was like newsprint, like the SPC catalog, and it was yellow on the front and it had little pictures in it. And it was all these things that this company makes. It was like an exquisite ______ illusion company, for lack of a better term. But they made imaginative things that you would use in displays and setups that were based on movies, like for ""The Little Mermaid"" they had two or three other models similar to my doll, and they had a whole bunch of other things that were different things, like Arabian figures and stuff. And they had this other mermaid with a purple fin, purple shells and blonde hair, and I was writing down the catalog number because that's another thing that I would want for my birthday. And then I woke up. That was messed up, man. That's all I can say about that."
"C-118"	"#C-118 (2004-03-02 (18)) Mom and I had to get on a plane, not surprisingly, but in the dream we had this flight scheduled for 7:30 in the morning. But you know how Mom is, she diddles and she daddles and she doddles and she doodles, and we didn't get out of the house until 9:30, so we had to take, I mean we had to reschedule to the 10:05 flight. Now in my dream the way it worked is, it would be just like a bus, you catch whichever one you can catch, but you know in life it doesn't work that way. And so we were at the airport getting ready for this flight, and I think we were shopping around in a few of those little stores that they have, and I can't remember a whole lot, but something happened that made us miss that one too. I think we couldn't get on it because our bags were too big, and we had to take one that left at 2:30. And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren't really going to get into town until 7:30 at night, which really we're getting there at like 6:00, or no, we're getting there at 4:45, but we probably won't get to Aunt Christine's house until 6:00. But in my dream we wouldn't even land until 7:30, and I was thinking, ""Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was -- diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn't get out until late. Oh, my gosh."" And that's really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I'm missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my destination, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that's that."
"C-119"	"#C-119 (2004-03-07 (18)) I was at Westport College and that I was going to take a test in English from like an English class. And they had brought in this professional test proctor and this test proctor had all the people sitting in black across part of the length of the room, just sitting on stools and taking this test. And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and Mom was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That's what me and Melinda used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and Mom was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we're picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I'm telling her, ""Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I don't know when the period's going to end, but I have to take the test."" But she said, ""You have extra time; don't worry."" And I think that was that, and then I woke up. But before any of this, before I went into my test room, I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hall talking to somebody, and she was going to drive up in a fire truck with a whole bunch of costumes. And she was going to whoop the siren really loud so everybody would know she was there with them."
"C-120"	"#C-120 (2004-03-08 (18)) I was in class on Friday and that my Spanish teacher was like a gifted teacher and a Spanish teacher combined. And she was like talking about these intellectual things and all, and on Friday I dreamt that she assigned us a paper to write in Spanish about our life and how it has been unfolding up to this point. And I was thinking that I would be able to do this because I was feeling confident about being able to express myself in Spanish, but I was feeling completely distraught over the fact that I thought I was going to have a week off, but here now I have this paper that I have to do, and that I'm going to have to do it on my trip because I have no other way to do it. And then, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, I was realizing that, hey, this is a dream, I don't even have Spanish class on Fridays and I got my Ethics paper done. And I know there was more to it, but I can't think of it at this time. And then that was it."
"C-121"	"#C-121 (2004-03-10 (18)) I was coming home from some busy kind of thing. And Dad had set me up with an interview at some pizza place, and it was mainly a job practice interview, and if I got the job, he made a comment like, ""Well, I'll have more money to sit on,"" [laugh] because, you know, I'm just saving up now. And so I went into this, we were riding with Mom, he and I were on a tandem and we rode down to this pizza place and we sat ourselves down at a table and Dad had brought two tuxedos -- one with a straight like scoop neck and one with a flowery, flowery whoo neck. And both of these were like men's clothes that were like way too big for me, but I was supposed to wear one of them for the interview. And the person came for me before I had a chance to put them on, and we did the interview. She asked a couple questions. She asked more questions than I offered information. Usually when I've done interviews with the internship program, I try to offer information like so they don't have to ask everything and drag it out of me. But I let them drag it out of me this time. [laugh] And I had to sign a form, which is like signing a statement in court, but they said I had to assent to the fact that I had a disability and I had to sign a form to do that. And then she asked some more questions, and then I went into another room where I was supposed to fill out an application, and there were these people sitting at these tables and somebody had this long involved math problem, and I took out a pencil out of my bag and I just took a shot at trying to solve it. And then about two or three steps down the way I gave up, and then I woke up. I don't know if I got the job or not."
"C-122"	"#C-122 (2004-03-18 (18)) Mrs. Dougherty was at our house, and she was laying in bed at night in the dark on Mom's side of the bed, and there was nobody else in the bed, but we were just kind of there doing our thing. And she was laying there and I was standing, and she wanted to know how my singing technique was presently. So she wanted to sing something and have me sing it back, and have her feel how I do it. And so she sings a couple of notes like in a minor key, and it kind of scared me a little and so I grabbed her hand, but then I was okay and I sang it back to her, and she kind of felt how I breathed and how I did it. And I think she wanted to do it a couple more times, and I think maybe we did. And then I laid next to her like I do with Mom, and she held me like Mom does. And I think that was the end of that."
"C-123"	"#C-123 (2004-03-18 (18)) I was in Jackson and I was at Aunt Christine's kitchen table, and I had a laptop and I was typing away on it. And Bobby came over and wanted to see what I was doing, and you know how in a Word document I can have either a white or a blue background and print on it to match? Well, Bobby came over and he was putting a background behind my text, and he put up this really crazy thing that was kind of like a baseball scene, and then he put up a scene of Niagara Falls, and I said, ""Okay, I like that one."" And I went back to work, but I was afraid he was going to read what I was writing. And I think he was doing something else. He closed my document and he was just doing all kinds of crazy stuff. And then I realized that this thing was not just a regular thing, but it had two or three octaves of musical keys right above the typing keys, and you could go to freestyle and you could just go crazy all over the place. And about that time I faded into consciousness. That was a crazy thing."
"C-124"	"#C-124 (2004-03-21 (18)) I keep having dreams that I'm at this school that's a combination of Westport High School and Westport College, and I keep waffling back and forth. I didn't do that when I came from Bancroft Middle School and went to Westport High School, so I don't know what's going on here. But I was in the Media Center at Westport High School, but I was taking a class in one of the rooms like I would take at Westport College. And I was up on the third floor and I was with some other people. They weren't like young people, but some of them were and some of them were like middle-aged older people. And class was kind of ending and everybody was just kind of sitting down and shuffling their books and stuff. And the fire alarm went off outside. You know how you don't hear it in the room, but then you hear it outside in the hallway? Well, all of us took our good old time packing up our stuff. Apparently we knew it was just a drill or they were like testing it or something. So we took our good old time -- that's kind of crazy. And so -- oh, I know -- by the time we were ready to walk out the door, everybody had their stuff because we had to like go all together and we had to wait for everybody to pack their stuff. Well, when everybody had their stuff, the alarm shut itself off, and so I had this immense fear going on that it was going to happen again while we were out in the hallway and it was going to be terrible. And dragging my book bag and stuff, and we can't really just go down the stairs because something is blocked or something, so we've got to go down these big ladder things and then walk across these like levels of concrete and then go down more big ladders and stuff. And we were all doing this with our stuff, and we got out to the, they had a bus circle at this place, and we were out to the bus circle and I thought I had missed my bus. So I was hopping a van with a lady and a couple of kids and they lived near me apparently and they were going to take me home. This van was a black van, if that makes any difference. And out there it looked like Westport High School. And as I was in the van, somebody said, ""Well, you could take the bus. Your bus is still here. You can take the bus if you want."" And I don't remember if I was on the bus or in the van coming home, but in my dream you had buses -- school buses -- to and from Westport College also."

So Mom and Dad went their way and Samantha, Sandra and I -- no, I think Mom and Samantha and Derek and I went through the school part and we were like going around peeking in these different windows, and when we would come to an exit door, it would have a little tiny sound coming from the exit like box. And some would be just a straight tone and some would be a crazy like up and down, but it was very soft, but each time I knew I could hear it. And I think we were going through the living areas and stuff, just peeking in windows. And for some reason when we came to like a, when we were just walking in a hallway, Derek handed me something, and he's like, ""Here, I bought you this."" And it was like an expensive mike to go with my mini disc recorder. [laugh] And I said, ""I want to pay you for it; I don't want you to just do this by yourself.""

"C-126"	"#C-126 (2004-03-24 (19)) I was at Modern Media College in like September, and it was really kind of disappointing because when I was walking around, I didn't really run into any like labs or anything, anything that looked fun. But, let's see, I don't remember really entering, but P_________ assigned some kind of teacher to be my mentor, and I think she was a private school teacher who taught there some times. And I was walking through the building and Mom and the teacher were going to take care of some other kind of business, and while we were all sitting in this big auditorium, somebody knocked a purse over of this girl, and spilled all her change on the floor, and so they were going to pick it up and put it back in the purse for her. And this place was very well lit. It had carpet on the floor most places, and it didn't have all those crazy colors on the floor like I remember when I actually went to the building a few years ago. And I was walking around, and there was sound everywhere, but I couldn't actually get close enough to see where it was coming from. I was like in a kitchen when I re-met up with Mom and the teacher, and I had to practice making a sandwich or finding things because that's what I was going to have to do, and this was a little pookie kitchen and it had like practically nothing in, that I was supposed to work in. But before that, when I was trying to work in the pookie kitchen, there was somebody messing with the sound system in like the middle of a foyer thing, setting up like a Peavey system type thing, and I couldn't go check it out because I was confined to the pookie kitchen. And then [laugh] Mom and the teacher showed up again, and we ran into Ms. Fend, and she was saying how some bank screwed her all up for some reason, and we walked along and we went to another kitchen, except this kitchen was full of books. It was full of like kiddie books, and there was another little closet that was dark and probably had some stuff in it, but I didn't go in there. And then all of a sudden we were at the house and the teacher lady was sitting down and relaxing and I was sitting next to her and we were talking about things. And there were these boys that were being real boisterous at the house and they were having this party, and one of them sat down on her lap and was kind of faking a lap dance. And she yelled, ""Hey, Mister, screw you!"" And she threw him off, and she picked me up and walked me into the bedroom, out of that mess. And I think that's that, I woke up."

And for some -- I don't remember too much, because again I let this go all day. I'm getting bad about that, so I forget most of them now. But Dad and Mom and I were like in a connecting airport, but we were outside on this deck and looking over like a roof into the city. And this thing was like a floating deck dock thing. It was like flying on air and it was like trampoline. We were jumping up and down on a trampoline. And in my dream Dad and I were holding hands and were like trampoline jumping back to the main terminal, which was like about ten foot square on the deck, and Mom was over in a chair by the main terminal. And I was thinking how trampoline jumping might bring back a bunch of scary stuff if we do too many maneuvers, but that wasn't a part really that much of it. And then I was thinking how nothing better happen with this plane because in my dream we were getting home from Jackson on a Sunday and I started class Monday morning, the next day, which fortunately on the way home everything went well on our real trip, and I could pull that off. But in my dream I don't think anything went wrong, and I think we just about made it onto the plane on time because we were waiting for them to call us, and they weren't calling us and weren't calling us, and we figured we'd better check and make sure everything is okay. And so we got on the plane and it was like, just like riding in a car, except we were riding along the interstate, and, you know, how do you slow down, you brake at a red light and you speed up and accelerate. Well, that's how this thing was. It was a vehicle with wings and the windshield was open and the windows were open, and it was like, it wasn't really a plane at all; it was a car.

And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you'd have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn't actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream!

And over in a corner my Mom was shoveling big plops of poop into a bucket, and I don't know where that came from, but she was saying, ""Getting the dirty stink out of the cafeteria would help them take their tests."" Well, duh! And then I must have been roaming around Westport High School or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for Westport College over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, ""If you don't get your exam by the scheduled time, the door's going to be locked and you won't get to."" And they just say, ""First period, second period, go to your next period exam."" But at Westport College, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing. And that's all I can really remember about this dream."
"C-137"	"#C-137 (2004-04-28 (19)) Some relatives were in town, and I think it was Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, and it was Christmas time. And we were doing something downtown and I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, in addition to these other people. And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn't making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, ""Oh, man, we don't even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in."" And Mom's like, ""Well, I don't know, we've got people to go do stuff with and we don't know what they're doing and what their plans are"" and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that Mom and Dad had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and Mom kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it wasn't going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, ""What!?"""
"C-138"	"#C-138 (2004-04-28 (19)) I felt like I was in a house that was kind of like our house and kind of like somebody else's house. And there were a bunch of people that I didn't really know, but I felt were friendly, and they were like people I think I was trying to get to know, like college age people. And I dreamt that in my Basic Electronics class, when we passed the final exam, we were given a little card that said that you were like a certified basic person, basically. And it was shaped just like my Best Buy gift card and it had the hologram on the front, and the credentials were printed on the back. And it had a little tiny picture of the music major down in the lower left-hand corner of the back, and a little further like in the middle of the card there was a little tiny picture of like a UPC symbol on the bottom right. And I was sitting kind of in a big roly chair looking at something that was kind of a combination of a computer and a CC TV. And I put this card under my tray and I was looking at it, and three boys and two girls all around were like, ""Oh wow, cool, you actually got one of these cards. Oh, my gosh!"" And there was this big dog, but she was real friendly. I had a feeling it was a she; I don't remember what they were calling her, but she was big. Her shoulders came up to my chest. She liked to kind of make it so that my hand's looped in her collar, and she would pull my chair along with her as she walked. And she pulled me back a little bit."
"C-139"	"#C-139 (2004-04-28 (19)) I was in the bedroom of this house, that was like our house, and I was with two of the other boys, and I was [laugh] putting together this really strange contraption. I had a black tube that was about three feet long, and it was about, it had two speakers attached to it kind of taped on with electrical tape at either end of the tube. And there were wires in the middle of the tube that connected them, and in the middle of this, that would come up from the tube vertically like a T, and on top of that I was going to put some kind of a -- like a control unit like type thing, like -- I don't know -- a crazy box. I don't know what it was supposed to do, but I wanted to rig it so that there was like a display that I wanted to rig on the outside of the tube, and I was soldering these wires all together so the thing would work. And I took the control box and I laid it face down on the bed, and I had this little bin of fasteners and I had this soldering iron that was about as heavy as a drill, and it was sort of, it had a wide, round tip that had a little boop in the center, and it had the solder within it instead of on a separate little thing. And what you would do is you would heat it up and you'd tip it upside down on the tip, and you would dab a little bit on and it would melt and you'd stick on whatever you wanted to stick on while it was still liquid. And I had these fasteners that were wires with little round tips at the end, so I was laying them in the thing, laying them in the blob of solder that I put on the terminals, and when I was done with this iron thing, I would like lay it on the bed. And worse yet, I would lay it on a newspaper on the bed. And when I woke up, I thought, ""Oh, my gosh, why the heck would I do something like that?"" And there were these two boys just watching what I was doing, and they were kind of jiggling and jury-rigging the wires inside this tube. And then I woke up."
"C-140"	"#C-140 (2004-05-02 (19)) My Spanish class was hosting this party. I think it was for some new guests or something. And we were kind of at a place that was kind of like our house and kind of like something different. And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with like a big roof and like white in the front, and they like made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I sort of went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can't remember what the significance of all this was. There had to be more to it, but heck if I remember."
"C-141"	"#C-141 (2004-05-05 (19)) I was participating in this NFD convention that was held in this stadium and outside, and we were walking around looking at different things. It was Mom and me and Terri that was there. And they were like, there was like a DJ and they were playing different CD's and stuff. Then we went to like the second level. In this particular stadium there were like where the, down on the field where most of the booths were, then there was a second level where some other -- it was like a thin little circle of fields that was a second level where other displays and booths were that were around. And we went back into a hall because we were looking for the bathroom. We found this audio booth where this girl was mixing, and I thought I used to know her. She reminded me of Abigail, the neighbor down the street, but I didn't know who she was in my dream. She was doing the mixing and stuff, and she was waiting for her next shift to come, and nobody else wanted to take over for her and she was kind of upset that nobody would take over for her. Terri, she asked if Terri would take over for her, and Terri was like, ""Nah, I don't do that kind of stuff."" And I had to cut in between in, I kind of waved my hand like you do in school, and waved it and shouted and cut in between them, and I said, ""I would be happy to take over for you if you teach me how to run your system."" And fortunately -- you know how like a band plays and then there's like a lull when they take a break -- well, fortunately I guess DJ's don't take breaks, but it was sort of a break phase while she was teaching me. This room that the equipment was in kind of put me to mind of the Warrior Vision room, and as much video equipment as they had in the Warrior Vision room, this was all audio equipment. She took me like from one thing to the next and like put my hand on it, and I was able to feel the front panel on each device, and I was able to sort of know what it is. I don't remember the most important thing. They did not have a mixer. [laugh] Shame on them! But had three CD's players. The first and the second one, 10 or 12 knobs across the front that were supposed to be like EQ things, and then they had the usual transport controls underneath the tray. And then they had a third CD player that was like a cream-colored personal CD player. Then they had two other weirdo things that I've never seen before. Oh, and then they had like tons of CD's, but I don't remember a mixer or an amplifier. How in the heck are we supposed to mix without a mixer? But anyway, I remember wishing that I had brought my magnifier so that I could at least try to read some of the titles, because after she left and she said like, ""It's all yours,"" I think Mom and Terri went to do something else. And I was just taking time to look through their collection and see what I could see. And they had tapes of stuff that you listened to that was recorded, books and stuff, and they had CD's that were kind of blah, but the good stuff that she was playing I couldn't find. I wasn't looking in the right place. And I felt like I was doing a terrible mix because I wasn't playing stuff that was appropriate for the crowd because I didn't know what I was going to queue up because I couldn't read the darned things and I didn't, like with my collection I know what's where. Well, this one I just had no clue. And then we were home -- man, I'm using up tape like crazy -- we were at home watching movies, and I think it was ""Brother Bear"" with sort of a crazy spin on it and when the movie ended, I think for some reason the amplifier was in the middle of the foyer with no wires attached to it. But I could still turn the volume down on the front and the volume would still go down and it would still control things. That was crazy! And I was picking up all these lettuce leaves off the couch, and I was putting them into this green container and crying for some reason. And these lettuce leaves had to go back to Blockbuster with the movie, why I do not know. But Dad was like, ""Are you crying like the Toyota?"" And I was like, ""No, I've got a stuffy nose and I always breathe like that when I have a stuffy nose."" And then I woke up."
"C-142"	"#C-142 (2004-05-06 (19)) The first part was that we were at this school, and their like big auditorium, and we were watching these kids perform, and they were like dancing around in a big circle in like pilgrim dresses and stuff. And there was, then the circle, they disbanded from the circle and they would take turns singing and all. Their accompanist was at a grand piano, and the keys weren't out lateral, they were like typewriter keys, all sort of on top of each other. And the guy, all the kids finished performing and the guy was like trying to tune it or something and he had the lid lifted, and there was like fire. There was a different color flame for each note and for different chords the different flames had to sort of mix. [laugh] That was so messed up, man. I don't know where that came from. But then the next scene was that I was at like a beach thing. I think it had something to do with a scholarship convention, and I was swimming with Mom. It started off to be that I was at a boat ramp and Mom and I sort of strayed from the band and people that were there, and we started swimming. And the first weird thing was that there was a boat coming and we didn't want to get run over and so he's like, ""Come on down,"" we've got to get under the water so that this boat can go over us. And so we went under, and I was able to breathe under water because apparently there was like a little air pocket that sort of came down with us, you know how things get. And then when we came up again, I noticed that we were two-thirds of the way across this bridge that was like, I don't know, fifteen or twenty feet long that was supposed to be the skyway, but it was too small to be the skyway. We were swimming to this little island, and Mom wanted to go in this little pet store and get food for the people's dog that we were staying with, but I was swimming naked and I didn't want to get out of the water, so I waited for her. And I started swimming back across the thing by the bridge, and on the other side there was like a turtle, and I touched the turtle, and then he immediately wanted to bite me. And I threw handfuls of sand at him so he would bite the sand and not me and I could get away. But he kept following me, following me, following me, and finally I just forgot about it and I went up on top of this bridge and I forgot all about the fact that I had been swimming naked, and they were like giving out like scholarship awards at this little pavilion. And I knew I was supposed to be one of them and I hoped that Mom would come over from the pet store in time. And I think that was it."
"C-143"	"#C-143 (2004-05-09 (19)) I had a wedding planned to a guy that I didn't even know hardly. He was somebody that I expected to get to know and we expected to hit it off really well. And Dad was like, ""Well, you should set up a wedding. You should get ready. You should have everything all set _____ the way you wanted to."" And so we set up so that we could have a reception at the Hilton, and then about a little while later he reminded that it was still set up and that it couldn't be cancelled because I wasn't really starting to get to know him, like he wasn't returning my calls and stuff. And he reminded me that time was running out to get to know him, and I just said, ""Okay, enough of this."" I ___________, but in my dream I did a bunch of crying and then finally I went to them and said, ""Look, I'll give you the money that it takes to cancel the thing, but I want you to cancel it."" And then he was like, ""Well, you were the one that set it up,"" and this and that, and I was thinking, ""No, I didn't. You were the one that made me."" And I think there was something else. I think Mom had found this really small premie baby and picked it up, sort of like you pick up a hurt bird and take it home and take care of it. So she sort of picked it up, it was abandoned, and she brought it home, and then we had a baby in the house, plus all this other stuff going on. And, oh yeah, one other additional part to this dream: I dreamt that I was at some kind of class that was teaching me how to do something technical. I think I was at a thing that was sort of a cross between a CC TV and a computer, and I don't remember what I was doing, but she was trying to get a feel for how much I knew. I was working with this lady, and I was kind of going off and thinking about my own thing, and I wasn't able to do what I was supposed to do. And I was too preoccupied by this heavy stuff about this stupid wedding. And then I think I woke up."
"C-144"	"#C-144 (2004-05-11 (19)) It was my birthday, of all things, probably because of the mermaid birthday story, and because on ______'s day I kept wanting to say, ""Happy birthday."" I dreamt that I was up here in my bedroom for most of the dream, and Uncle Carl was giving me two presents. I can't remember exactly what they were, but they were kind of juicy things that somehow I could use. They were kind of like utilitarian gifts. And the first one, I think, was some kind of clear plastic clipboard, and it had some words on it. It was like an overhead projector clipboard. The next present that he gave me was like a cone thing that you yell through. It was cardboard, and it had like some blue stars on it. Now what's up with that, I don't know! But he wrapped it up in a box real pretty. And then Mom, a little while later after he left, Mom was going to give me a present and it was supposed to be The Present of all presents, if you know what I mean. It was supposed to be the one present I've been wanting a long time. And somehow I got ticked off, but I didn't want her to know. And it was like a small kind of box wrapped in white paper with some flowers. And I opened it up and it was a baby thing. [laugh] And it kind of shrunk a little more as I looked at it, and it was white -- I don't know -- but even though it was small and babyish, I remember being pleased, really, really, really pleased. And then I woke up."
"C-145"	"#C-145 (2004-05-16 (19)) I was raising and hatching these baby chicks; there were about five or six of them, and I had eggs in an incubator. And I don't remember too much about the incubator part, but it was like this box that I had that I was hatching these eggs. And it was like a f______ project, and I seem to remember the chickies coming out, and there were three yellow ones, a brown one and two black ones. And, you know, they were hopping around doing their thing, and I was thinking, ""Oh, how cute! I can take these to the fair and show them."" And then, I can't remember, something else was going on. Some elderly woman took me to this big, open hall type thing, and there was tons of stuff going on; I can't remember exactly what. But when I came back, I realized that the black chickie had run away, something happened to the brown one, and the three yellow ones had died because I forgot to feed them anything before I left for the big, open hall. I think I had given the brown one away, the black one ran away and the three yellow ones had died. And I'm so disappointed and so heart-broken that here I let these chickies just die because I didn't feed them, I didn't have a chance to feed them or get them any of that baby chick starter stuff before I went to the big, open hall thing. And that's when I woke up. And the funny thing about this dream is that the next day we went to a garden-like place, and there was a frog right by a little map sign thing, and I used to pick up frogs all the time and put them in my pocket. But then a couple years ago I started getting really grossed out when I touched them. But this time I just picked up that frog like I used to do when I was little, and held it in my hand for a few minutes and let it go. And I was appreciating its creature-hood, if you know what I mean. And I was glad that this creature didn't end up like the baby chicks in my dream."
"C-146"	"#C-146 (2004-05-18 (19)) First of all, I remember there was a lot of stuff going on and I only remember about half of it, but that's still a lot; trust me. The first thing I can remember clearly is that I had a math class at Westport College with a lady professor, and she was talking to us about how math is heavenly, but it's a cold heaven and it takes like, it keeps your mind thinking reason and logic and all that stuff. And I'm thinking, ""Yeah, right, lady."" And I had this, you know how in high school they had a book which had like two and a half pages each night? Well, that's kind of how this was, except it was like two facing pages was our assignment. And the first problem kind of read like this, ""John bought five milliliters of ice cream, a cone, a rong (spelled r-o-n-g) and an equal = sign and a summation sign + 9 milliliters. So apparently you had to figure out how many milliliters in a cone and then add up the cone and the five and then figure out what the rong was. And then the rest of the problem was he was buying all this other food, like pizza with chicken on it and burgers with bacon, and you were supposed to know like how much it cost or how many calories it was without any other information. And I had a whole page of these to do and I was just starting to think about the first one. And next thing I knew, we were up in Jackson and Mom and I were like on a vacation, and I had all these problems to do on my vacation. And I think we were at Grammy's house first, downstairs, sort of getting settled and all. And we were waiting for Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry to come over, and Mom wanted to go up the stairs into Grammy's attic to get like her sewing or something that was up there. And so she turned on the light on the stairwell and we went up, and then she turned on the light in that first big main room where everything is, and she started digging around, rooting around, and believe it or not, I was kind of afraid to go too far into that room, but I was afraid to go back down the stairs because she had turned off the light in the stairwell, and it was dark downstairs in the house. So I'm like sitting there, or I'm like standing there on the first step, gripping the wall post molding thing between the stairwell and the room, and focusing on the light in the room, but gripping that molding thing so tight so that I wouldn't fall down the steps. And just waiting for her to just root around and spend all day and do do do do do do. And then I don't remember us going down, but next thing I knew, we were in Aunt Christine's cellar in her game room and the light was on by Bobby's pool table. And the room was much bigger than it really is. And Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and Uncle Burt were in that room talking about making some kind of salad for dinner, and I felt bad that we must have woke up Uncle Burt somehow because, you know, he goes to sleep really early. And I wanted to go up to Uncle Larry and say ""Hi,"" but I didn't want to hang around too much and look dorky because, see, he just got the b___________ in real life, and in my dream I remembered that. And I didn't want to act like I was too anxious to hear it. I wanted to act normal like I was anxious to see him. But I didn't want to be too anxious, you know how that goes. And fortunately it ended on a happy note like that, and then I sort of woke up. Man, I can't tell you what all that's about. But I can say that we've been listening to Bruce Springsteen lately while we've been doing major cleaning projects around the house. Yesterday I ran my sound system instead of having Mom run her Bose machine because hers is in her room kind of facing north, and mine has more power and it's sort of got more force behind it and it can just face right out the open door into my bedroom where we were working. So I blasted it and the whole time I was thinking about Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and how carefree they are up there, and how I wish we could be back up there, no matter how snowy it is still at this time of year. And I think the math has to do with that I know that there are college math classes, and that I can't imagine myself being able to keep my sanity having one. And it was all I could do to get __________, and in this dream I was just sort of visualizing myself not being able to finish my homework and having these terrible test scores and everything I already went through in high school. And maybe it symbolizes like the stuff I'm having to go through now; I don't know."
"C-147"	"#C-147 (2004-05-20 (19)) The story lines of me starting off a new year of school and somebody having a wedding were so closely intertwined, it was kind of hard to make sense of it all. But I think the first scene had to do with me being at Westport College and going to take a more advanced electronics class there. Well, first of all, the most clearest thing in my mind is I was with this guy who kind of acted like Andrew, and he was showing me that if you constructed this little round decorative thing out of metal, and you mount it on a sort of a metal plate, that there's holes in the metal plate that you put, that you attach a chain to. And you attach this chain and then you can chain it. And I think that he sent me to, it was Mom and I and we rode with him in this little golf cart down this path with these little ginger bready houses around it, and that was supposed to be the Westport College campus. And we came to the office of the man that I really wanted to talk to, but before he was there, we had some time to wait, so Mom and I kind of took off and we went to -- I can't remember where we went -- but I think we went to some kind of CD store or something, some place to shop, I think. And now it gets kind of fuzzy from there. But then I remember coloring some cards. They, I can't really explain what was on them, but you know how when I first look at a black and white thing, I can't tell what in the heck it is until I look at little parts of it and put it together? Well, it was like, it was in the ""I don't know what the heck it is"" stage, and I never put it together. I was trying to, but I could never make sense of them. I was just coloring all kinds of crazy colors [laugh] . And what else? [yawn] Then we were in this store and somebody was having a wedding and they were looking at tablecloths and party supplies and pink napkins, and I was thinking, ""Oh cool, if there's some pink napkins left over, I can get them and use them as pink stuffing or something."" And we were looking at white lacy tablecloths and stuff and I think we were enjoying _______, and then sort of I faded into consciousness after that."
"C-148"	"#C-148 (2004-05-22 (19)) Boy, did I have a long dream last night, and I remember it so clearly too. Lately I haven't been remembering quite this clear. I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School helping Mrs. Dougherty with some kind of play that they were doing. And in addition to her, they had another voice teacher, that I think was Ms. Burton. She was taller and a little chunkier, and she was wearing blue and Mrs. Dougherty was wearing black. And apparently the kids liked Ms. Burton better, but I thought she was kind of boring, and the kids liked her better because she was kind of boring. She wasn't as vocally insightful, I guess you would say. She just went through the motions and tried to be a person. And I was helping them in the auditorium with s_______ and stuff, and I can't really remember too good, but I was mostly just standing around. And then we had to take a bus to a portable, and the bus drove us around the campus and drove us up into the portable, and drove us around in the portable until it found a place to park. And then it was just Mrs. Dougherty's class in this portable, and I had written two songs and she wanted me to give them to people to stand up and sing. And the one I had a written was a concept that I would rather be there to experience it, even though there was some stress. And I wasn't given ______ anything basically, and that song was about when I was in her class in high school. And the person couldn't really read my handwriting, so I was having to sing some of the words along with them, just so they could get through it. And then next thing I know Mom and I are walking with her out by like a bus circle. It looked like Bancroft Middle School's bus circle, but it was still at Westport High School, if you could imagine that. And she was talking about like sewing and stuff, and then we got out there and Mom stops. Apparently there was an alarm box out there that had like corrosion and stuff all over it, and Mom stopped and it was like, ""I told them about this. I don't know why they're not doing anything about it."" So she goes to the office and I'm out there with Mrs. Dougherty in the bus circle and I think Dad is there at that time, and I'm asking him, ""Is the alarm going to go off?"" and he won't ask me. So I figure out what that means. And so I run through the parking lot bus area and up onto this grassy medium that's got bushes and stuff so that I'm away from the building, and at that time I realize that I'm totally naked and I'm laying down and I've got a towel. I cover my head with the towel and I'm just laying there, all these bushes and stuff. And then Mom comes back and I call her over, and I tell her I need my clothes. And then I realize that there's a hotel above the school where we've been staying and that's where all my clothes are. And I find the clothes and then Dad shows up, and we're waiting and waiting and waiting, and they make an announcement on the intercom that the alarm might go off without warning. So I'm laying there with a towel over my head and I sort of heard it, but I put my clothes on and then I lay back in that position. And then there's a bench in front of us and they're unpacking all kinds of yogurt and juice and stuff, and they're picnicking out. And I sort of get less uptight because it hadn't gone off yet and it's been quite a while, and then I woke up."
"C-149"	"#C-149 (2004-05-23 (19)) Man, did I have a bizarre dream last night! Well, first of all I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School, kind of at like a summer school camp thing, and the transition students from the Wilcox Center were all there at this camp thing. I don't know why I keep having dreams about being back at Westport High School. I just don't get it! We were like doing a like a tour or some kind of a PE thing, and there was like this courtyard thing that we were all one. And we were like walking around the school and then coming back to the courtyard. The fire alarm system went off while we were out there, and, of course, it wasn't too terrible because we were out in the middle of a big space between a bunch of the buildings and things. And we were already out, so there was no reason to go running in either. I don't remember it was, whether it was just sort of a fluke or what. All the buildings it had shut off in except for the gym. The PE teacher was Ms. Lyons and she was going to take us in that gym no matter what. Yeah, it was still sounding in the gym, but she was going to take us in there anyway. And we were lining up getting ready to go in there. And you know how at Westport High School the Media Center and everything over in that area was like twice as bad as the other buildings. Well, the gym was like that too. And I was getting ready to skip class and run off somewhere, so I would have done anything except going into that gym while that alarm was sounding. And I couldn't believe that the PE person was going to take us in there anyway. But as we were going in there, it just seemed to get quieter and quieter and just sort of not be a thing any more. And it must've just been outside or something like that. And then we were doing our thing, we were playing ball or something, I don't remember. And then one of the girls in the transition program told me that she thought that Dad was having an affair with Charlotte Church because she saw these pictures of them together on the internet. And that all the details about how she was attracted to him because he made her feel so special and how now she wanted to be called Maggie or Gigi, and that Charlotte was just sort of a middle name. And that was such a surprise! And I think there was one other person involved in this, but I can't remember who. And then all of a sudden I was here in my house and I found this CD on the desk that like had some pictures and stuff on it. So I brought it up here and put it in my machine up here and tried to open it up, and it started acting like the Windows operating system, like the usual thing that you get, and to close in the upper right and all like that. And when I finally got to open the main part, it was like some kind of game thing. It was all these different pictures, and I was trying to copy and paste that one picture of him with Charlotte Church onto like a blank document, and I couldn't because it was in this game thing. And I was trying to open up the list of jpegs to that I could just grab that one, and I woke up before I could get there."
"C-150"	"#C-150 (2004-06-01 (19)) It started off and we were going somewhere, we weren't exactly sure where. And I think I was back at school again. Why the heck do I keep having all these dreams about being back at school? I don't remember too much right now, but let's hold off and maybe sometime later in the day I will. Now I remember some. I think it was about somebody saying something about being totally irresponsible. I can't remember what the situation was, but I think it -- oh, I know what it was. Something about putting so much food at the top of the refrigerator and it blocks the light at the bottom on Uncle Charlie's sandwich and then wouldn't we give him enough consideration to at least let the fridge light be on his sandwich. And that was something that Dad was saying. And [laugh] this dream is full of bits and pieces of nonsense. And I think another thing was -- let's see her now -- oh, there was this picture, there was this still picture of one of these American Idols standing on stage. I think it was like a freeze-the-tape shot, if you know what I mean. Somebody was saying something about that it was going to start up a second time this year, but it was going to be a lot sloppier and a lot goofier. And I'm trying to think, there's something else. Something about a machine that wasn't really adjusted right, and you had to do something really weird in order to adjust it. That's about all."
"C-151"	"#C-151 (2004-06-02 (19)) Well, first of all, let me try to explain this. I dreamt that I was staying at this hotel because I was going to a place where I had to be by myself. But it was kind of a weird hotel in that I think the way it worked was you had to exchange your bags at just a certain time, and it was something scary like you had to do a math problem in order to get them back. And I remember being kind of lost, and it was really, really late. It was like after dark, and I was outside, and I was trying to get back to this hotel. And then once I got into the hotel, I didn't know where my room was. It was just kind of all mixed up jumble of mish-mash, I don't remember. But these scenes were totally incongruent. Next thing I knew I was with this girl, and Dad I think, and I had the bird and the bird wasn't just a live bird; he was part live and part mechanical. He had this mechanical thing in him where he would start saying crazy things, and I think there was something about, ""new bells, cockle shells,"" but I don't remember where it came in. I just know that it came in somewhere. I know there was more, and I'm missing half the pieces, but lately I've been really bad about not remembering my dreams that well. Now obviously some of this came from the convention, and yeah, it was a big hotel and yeah, I had to be by myself, but I didn't feel alone at the convention because there were so many other people, period, and people I could feel like were friends, and people that were visually impaired and knowing that they were here for the first time too. And I wanted to learn from them how they were going to function, so I didn't feel alone. But in my dream I felt terribly alone. And the thing about exchanging our bags all over the place, I don't know exactly where that came in, but I do know there was this guy with us that liked ""Mash,"" but I was never scared of losing my bags or scared of something taking them. And I don't know, it was a mish-mash."
"C-152"	"#C-152 (2004-06-04 (19)) These are two dreams that I had while I was staying up at the springs, but I didn't have this tape with me so I couldn't remember them then, so I'm recording them now. The first night I dreamt, I had kind of a screwy dream about a fire truck again. I keep having dreams on and off about fire trucks with the scary back-up alarm sound, and it's got to be kind of a dream symbol and I've got to figure out what it means. But anyway, I dreamt that I was going to help out the fire station with some kind of carnival or something. I don't remember having to deal with the Peavey system, but I was running around like putting tables up and stuff, and I had my cell phone on. The thing of it was, whenever anybody would call me on the cell phone, instead of answering the phone, I had to jump on the, you know, like hold onto the side of one of the trucks and let them drive off on a call with me. And we didn't only go on a call, we just sort of went around the block and came back. That was kind of stupid! But I had like a partner who was going to drive, like a man, like you know how they do. And Dad was there and I had a feeling he was like directing the events. He wasn't really going on any calls, but he was like an active lieutenant for the day. And when we'd jump on the side of the truck, the truck had two vacuum cleaner hose like type things hanging off the back of it dragging in the street. And you know how back-up alarm goes ""Doo doo, doo doo,"" well, the one hose would make the high ""Doo"" sound and the other hose would make the ""doo."" [lower pitch] And [laugh] now that I think about it, it's the funniest thing. It would be going down the road like that. And it would do that sound when we were going forward, and we wouldn't back up, we'd just go forward and it would make that sound. And I know there was something more. Oh, in my dream it kind of scared me and I was dreading, dreading, dreading having to go on that. And so whenever I would get a call on my cell phone, I would think, ""Oh no, oh no, I've got to go do this."" And that was that."
"C-153"	"#C-153 (2004-06-05 (19)) I was babysitting a kid named Joey, and I think it came from a Joey that Mom used to babysit. But this Joey was a toddler, and he had like two other kids running around and they were girls. And they had a keyboard in their room. It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender -- and these were about 4 or 5"" high -- there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change to their particular patch sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don't remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, ""Here comes Latisha; she's ready to see her."" And then ""doot, do, doot, do, do"" and ""Now, here comes the other one. She's a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do,"" or something like that. And I don't remember anything more."
"C-154"	"#C-154 (2004-06-06 (19)) Wasn't really so odd, but was sort of normal, as a matter of fact. I dreamt that my Mom and I were going to go to some park that we don't usually go to, and we were going to take the boom box and we were going to go by ourselves. And we were going to take some Pringles and some root beer and some fun snacks. And we were just going to go there and munch out and relax and just have fun. We were supposed to leave the house at 3:00 so that it would give us an hour and a half to be over there before she has to come home and fix supper. Well, she was dawdling -- and diddling and dawdling, and diddling and dawdling, and we weren't even close to getting out of the house until like 4:30. And I said, ""Listen, we took up all our time. What's the use of us going now?"" And all the stuff was out in the front yard by the bike, and the chips and everything was out there, and the boom box had turned into a small, little dinky, teeny portable unit. And I was bringing it inside, and I came in the front door and Dad was standing right there on the front porch and said, ""Well, hello, Jess!"" I just sort of put it down in a corner and was really embarrassed. And this is the craziest part: there was like a bench in our front yard that was blue and it had like, you know, the plastic diamond things that, you know, benches have. And I was getting really, really hot and bothered on that bench about something, and I bent over the back of it and I had the notion that somebody saw me. And I'm trying to think what else happened. Oh, then we were inside again, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, and we were giving Dad a Father's Day present, but there was a wedding card that I made that was just of a couple, a bride and a groom, but when you opened up the card, it said something really gross inside -- I don't remember what. But Samantha gave that card to Dad and I snatched it away from him because I said, ""That's not a Father's Day card; that's supposed to be for somebody else and that's for something else."" And then I think I woke up."
"C-155"	"#C-155 (2004-06-10 (19)) I was going in a van with some other people we knew and Mom to this ranch, and this ranch had horses on it. And there was this lady named Greta that was kind of acting like Aunt Christine. Come to think of it, I think Aunt Christine was with us and this lady she ______ Greta, and a kid named Travis, and some guy and Mom and I. And this ranch was, first of all, in this van the seatbelt was really, really hard to snap together, and it was sort of a big and roomy van, but it was sort of like a, not really that nice to ride in. And this ranch had horses, and I had the notion that they had lots of stuff they were going to do there, but they were not going to let me stay there by myself because somebody licensed has to be with the horses at all times. And you had to be a licensed driver to be able to take care of these horses. And that was kind of weird, but I felt sort of inferior because I'm not a licensed driver, but what does being a licensed driver have to do with being able to take care of them? And they were, they just seemed like kind of prissy people that didn't belong in the country, if you know what I mean. And I think this deals with deeper issues in that riding a horse isn't necessarily like driving, but people like to box people in, and I think I've been feeling some of the red tape that I'm having to cut through in life and that's what this dream is all about."
"C-156"	"#C-156 (2004-06-13 (19)) I was checking in to a big hotel with a group of four or five other people my age. And we weren't really going to stay there for the night, but we were going for a late banquet dinner thing. And I can't remember if it was NSC or ABWA, but it was one of those places. And I was supposed to give a speech to this group of people at a banquet, and I was already late, and I was going with a black boy, two white boys and another girl, I think. And we were, they sort of thought they knew way to our rooms, and I think one or two of them had white canes. And they just sort of were showing me the way to get to there, and they were, ""Maybe it's this one,"" open the door and it's dark, ""No, not in there."" ""Maybe it's this one. All these doors are locked."" And we went up an escalator and we climbed up a couple stairs and through a little gift shop thing and we were kind of in the wrong place. We weren't supposed to go up that way. And then we went down an escalator that was really, really, really, really tall and sort of had turns like regular stairs do and little landings. And I grabbed the railing and we just sailed down that escalator. It went so fast. And then we ran back to the desk because then we were really late. And the desk person, I think I said, ""We're trying to find a big convention room. Where is the banquet going to be for them?"" And they said, ""Oh, that's in Building 16B."" And the thought sunk in that this hotel has sixteen buildings and this was only Building #1, and I was thinking how it sure would be nice of them to get us a carry guy to get a golf cart and take us right to the place we need to be. But they seemed to let us alone and just let us do our thing. We started out the front door and down the sidewalk, and then I woke up."
"C-157"	"#C-157 (2004-06-15 (19)) Had a couple of different scenes to it, but the one -- this is like the afternoon now -- but the one that stuck in my head the most is the weirdest. I was making a dinosaur cookie and I was frosting it with bright green frosting, and I was putting some brown on the dinosaur's feet and kind of swirling a little brown up near his back and even his really beady eyes. And I guess he looked pretty mean because Dad was standing there and saying, ""Now what kind of impression do you think this is going to give people? People are going to think that you have an attraction to violence, and you may be a suspect of something, and you may be arrested, and you may lose everything in a moment."" And I was thinking, ""Oh yeah, over a dinosaur cookie."" But that was kind of, I don't know. There was more to it; I don't remember though. This is what I get for waiting."
"C-158"	"#C-158 (2004-06-17 (19)) Two nights ago I had a dream that Grammy on Mom's side, who has since deceased, was going to sleep on a blanket in my studio. She was laying like against the wall with her back to me, facing my desk and all my CD cases and stuff, and I was covering her up so that she wouldn't be cold in the night, because it was the dead heat of summer and we had the air conditioner on. And she was just snoring away, in the loud way she usually snored. And I think Mom and I were singing to her or something. But I thought it was kind of odd, I guess, in that thinking about how their family up there is so much different from this family here. Tonight, last night I had a dream that Mom and I were going to see Bryan Adams at a small place like a restaurant, and it was sort of an intimate concert thing. And we were going there on the bike, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were supposed to meet us because we had a bunch of tickets. And we were already starting to get there late, and we were like walking the tandem bike across 22nd Avenue, and I was telling her, ""The least you can do is get me to a concert on time, you know."" And then we got back on and rode the rest of the way, and we went in the concert and it was just about starting, and they started with, ""Everything I Do I Do For You."" By the time we got in, they were doing a bunch of songs I didn't even know, and I was thinking how this concert was going to be recorded, so I tapped the level down nine or ten notches on the mini disc recorder so with all the booming and banging it wouldn't make it clip over. And Mom went outside and called the people on the cell phone to tell them that 16th Street was closed, 5th Street was closed, and 2nd Street was closed because they were doing some massive construction. And at the concert they were like, the band was sitting up there with a blue background, and for, I saw for whatever reason, I was doing like some really sick stuff in front of everybody and trying not to make it obvious. But it was such a habit. And I don't remember too much more. Oh, I know, the concert and all the sound and stuff evolved into just something in our bedroom that was playing on a little boom box, and then I woke up."
"C-159"	"#C-159 (2004-06-20 (19)) Was kind of out of the ordinary, but it wasn't too crazy. I dreamt that, first of all, I was trying to access the State University website over the internet, and it was apparently by taking some courses from State University because I was trying to figure out what some course material was and what kind of books I was going to need or something, or what the teacher was going to be doing the next thing, or something like that. And I was having a s_____ read different prompts and things, just, you know, like in zoom text except it wasn't really magnified all over the place. I had a real simple screen that I was working from, and the synthesizer was reading a lot of the stuff. And I had to adjust the rate so that it would read slower, and I couldn't, and then I sort of figured out how. And I think Mom was working with me on this one, and she was telling me that you could access the whole thing from a cell phone, and I didn't believe it. It was too whacked out. But then, the next little scene is the part that I remember the best. I was at this ba____ like place, it was like a trailer area but it sort of had more of a farm to it. There were vehicles and things around and there were cages of, most of the cages were empty, but there was this one cage that was sort of covered in the front that had big bars and they were wide apart. And they had geese in it, there were about seven or eight geese in a cage about the size of the chicken cage, and they were all jammed in there. And most of them were grown. But there was this one black goose that was real, real thin and light compared to the others, and I had a feeling that she wasn't really eating. She sort of quacked like a female duck, but she had a long neck and a big body like a goose. And she ducked her head and was able to scoot through the bars of the cage, and I put her down on the ground and she was following me up the road to this house. And she kind of got tired and I picked her up and carried her. And she just had a real sorry sound to her, and I had the feeling she hadn't been eating very well. And I told the lady who runs this place, I showed her this black goose and I said, ""I don't think she's been eating that well. Look at her. And the lady grabbed her from my arms and said to the bird, ""What do you think you're doing?"" basically yelling at the bird for getting out of the cage. And I said, I snatched her back and I said, ""That's not the point. What I'm trying to get you to understand, Lady, is that she hasn't been eating very well. You have to give her something."" And just about that time the bird left a big plop of poop running down my leg, and then I woke up."
"C-160"	"#C-160 (2004-06-21 (19)) I was back at Westport High School again, except this time I was with Astrid and Darlene, and I was there like a couple hours after school had left out for some odd reason. And I was there with my mobility instructor, Mr. Heffler, and they were doing some construction on the stairs and in order to actually get down the stairs, they had the stairwell part blocked off, and they had some like loose boards. You had to undo one of the loose boards and climb down a little step ladder makeshift thing to actually get down to the lower level. And the elevator was, it kind of worked sometimes and it didn't work other times, and we didn't want to take a risk. And I think me and Darlene were on the elevator one time, and the building had like five or six floors for some odd reason, and for whatever reason the elevator wouldn't stop at whatever floor we wanted. And I think this dream was a big hodgepodge mish-mash of all different stuff, and I think after I got my business done, I was like wandering around in this school building that was Westport High School, and it was all in shambles, and it was supposedly that way because they were doing construction. And I mentioned about the stairwell being blocked off and there was just stuff laying around all over everywhere. And it was real precarious. And Darlene and I had a cab to catch. I don't know what business we had to do over at the school, but after we finished our business we had a cab to catch at 4:30, I think. And it was real gray and rainy outside and we were making our way back to the cab circle because that's where the cab was going to pick us up. And I don't remember if I ever made it or not.

I think Mom and somebody else were still getting ready, and Dad was standing at the door like, ""Okay, I'm ready whenever you are."" And I was sitting on the porch swing, and Derek gets out of the car and comes up to the porch and comes in the door and closes it. And this is just unfolding like ______ just I guess so we can look at it, but I think he's like cocking a gun or something, and then he went back out the door, and he got a chain saw and I saw he was going to bring it in the house. And he's revving it up and stuff out front there, and I thought he was going to bring it into the house. And so I ran through the house, and for some reason our house was a little bigger. And then different things kept stopping us. I think I might have been riding with Melinda a little bit, but I can't remember if we actually went where we were going. We were planning a wedding for me. Apparently Grandpa had given me some wedding rings and we had to just find me a person to go through the ceremony with just to show him that I got married with his rings, and we weren't actually going to legally do it, I don't think. And I can't remember who it was going to be, but we were getting all this stuff ready. And people were just like dawdling majorly because there were so many things, and I was outside getting some different stuff. And there was a brown and a white baby chick, and I would catch one of them and take it to the side of the house and put it in a cage, and then I'd go up for the other one. And when I was catching these chickies, I was sort of thinking how I've got to bring them in here so they won't run too far and so the truck won't back over them. And there was also a brown and a white grown chicken that I was catching and putting by the side of the house because I didn't want them in the cage so they would peck the babies. And I was sort of devising some kind of little fence to keep them by the side of the house. And then I was doing a bunch of other stuff in the yard, but I can't remember what. And then I was coming in the house and saying, ""Okay, everybody, are you all ready finally?"" And they were saying, ""Well, we're going to come out there to you."" And they were saying something like, ""I'd better go talk to Grandpa because I don't know if he wants you to have his rings or if he wants you to have my rings."" And then I woke up.

One was kind of small and the other three were really big, and somebody was saying I should try them out and see what the sound sounded like, see how real they sounded. And I don't think Mom or Dad were there. I think this was like a big, it was either a garage sale or a party; I couldn't figure out which. But they were inside, busy as anything, and there were people everywhere. And so I put the smallest one on a little table out front, and there was a whole bunch of chaos and confusion, so I had to really listen and tell if it sounded normal or not. And it didn't really. It was kind of funny and kind of weird. And then, so I put it back on the sidewalk where it was with the others, and a bunch of other boxes of clothes and toys and things. And I went inside and Mom was making me a birthday cake that was supposed to look like that, either that or a mixer; I couldn't figure out which. But she started frosting it with chocolate frosting, and dabbing some white here and there. And next thing I know, the very front of the cake was crumbling off, and I could see that inside it was a yellow cake. And then some more of the sides crumbled off, and this cake was just getting smaller and smaller and messier and messier. And I don't remember too much about that little scene. But the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were out of town and the house was totally empty, and I was having Analisa and one of her friends over. Now Analisa is a Jehovah's Witness that's been coming around and, you know, sort of preaching once a week. And I was going to serve them Cheerios and something else, Cheerios and tea, I think, for lunch. And I had a little gold card from them that said something other than ""Happy Birthday,"" but I sort of knew it was for my birthday. And I didn't want to tell them too much about what I did for my birthday because they don't celebrate birthdays and they would frown upon it. But I served them Cheerios, and they said that, they called them rings of cereal. One of the girls said that she did like rings of cereal, but without any fat or any sugar or anything in them.

I shouldn't have gone to the bathroom before I started recording this. But another little scene thing that was before that, that's really clear in my mind, that I dreamt that Dad found out what a teetsy (?) thing is, which really that was something unreal from back in the day when I was real little, that was like a guitar-shaped, light-up flashlight thing that would play the end of ""Have You Seen Her"" and stuff. It was sort of a synesthetic (?) response to the sound that I heard. Well, fast forward 'til now. I dreamt that Dad thought that it was something that you would have to connect to the phone line in order to use, and that it would make your phone bill go real high if you did anything on it. And some boy had it, I think. And I was pretty upset and a little afraid because I was under the impression that it wasn't real, and here he's talking like it was real. And I tried to tell him it isn't real, but he said, ""Well, I saw somebody that had one, so it is real."" And I was terrified. And then I, in my dream I went downstairs after being, I don't know, up here, and Mom and Dad were watching TV and I kissed Mom good night and I whispered in her ear that she should come up when she can.

Last night I had kind of a strange dream before huge claps of thunder woke me up, and I must've been hearing rain in my dream because it played into my dream in a funny way. I dreamt that our house was just a little bigger than it is, and our living room was huge and kind of intersected with our porch in a way. There wasn't that wall there. And Mom was sleeping out in the living room with some big pillows and Dad was like, ""Are you sleeping out here because the roof's leaking in the bedroom?"" And Mom was like, ""No, I'm just sleeping out here because there's such a nice breeze, so I really appreciate it."" And then we found out that the roof was leaking in the bedroom and he got so mad that she wouldn't tell him. But instead of roof in my dream, they were talking about the fact that the door was leaking. I don't know why. And let's see; what else? Then after that I was walking around the house getting some stuff out of the kitchen and stuff, and this naked man with a guide dog was going through the house. And I had never seen him before. And I got the impression like he was staying with us or something. And his dog was black, and his shoulders came up to my chest, like a little bigger than they usually are, and was like sniffing me. And the guy was saying, ""Come on. Come on."" And he just kept walking through our house for some reason. And I was supposed to go down in the cellar to get our party mix that I was going to take to the party today, but they only had this little tiny, little bitty light bulb up in the ceiling of the cellar and it wasn't making much light at all and it was real dark outside. And I told Mom, ""I'm not going to go down there unless you change the bulb and make it its full brightness."" And I don't think I ever did get down there to get my cereal, I don't know, but I was real glad that all of this was a dream."
"C-166"	"#C-166 (2004-07-18 (19)) For some reason I was feeling a little bit sick and weak, and Dad was wondering if I wanted to go to the beach, or go out in the tub outside. And I told him that I didn't. I think I felt like I had a fever or something and I just wanted to lay around and do nothing. And I don't remember too much more about that. But then in the next little vignette I felt okay and we were out at the beach, and I was walking in this water and Dad said there were a ton of little sharks around. But I wasn't really afraid of them because I knew they were just going to swim around and not bite us. They were like the size of kids' toys. But then when I was sitting on the beach when he was out swimming, there was a stingray laying up on the shore, and the stingray stung me right in the palm of my hand, and it wasn't really all that painful, surprisingly enough, but the stingray wasn't soft like they usually are; it was hard and rubbery like a toy. And I knew there were more in the sand because I could kind of feel them, and this was gross, but there was one -- I guess I was swimming naked -- there was one that was about to sting me in the butt, and I like shuffled it away. And then I was like, ""Well, what am I supposed to do? I got stung by a stingray."" And he said, ""Now let's dive in the water."" And I was afraid to go across that sand that led, you know, like there's loose sand then there's packed sand and then there's water? In the packed sand stingrays were popping up all over everywhere. But when I did get in the water, we swam and we swam out to this bridge that was in the middle of the ocean, and I hung onto the side of the bridge because I couldn't touch. And Dad pulled a knife out of the bottom of the ocean and said that it was an artifact because it was used during the Civil Rights Movement back in the '60s to cut niggers' heads off. And Dad actually said that, and he'd never said anything like that in real life. Now I couldn't understand where in the world that came from. And so I was there on the bridge and he went out for another swim, and he buried the knife back in the sand. And there was this woman that came out on the bridge and gave me a little brochure about herself, like she was some kind of a sea marine biologist or something. And then I woke up."
"C-167"	"#C-167 (2004-07-21 (19)) I was up in Jackson at Aunt Christine's house, and I was down her driveway out front, in front of her house, and they had tables set up and it was night time and they had bright street lights shining down on it. And all the cars were moved out and kind of parked on the street. And they had tables set up and we were eating lasagna out there. And there was stuff out like she was having some kind of a garage sale, but we were eating and socializing like we were having a party. And then she said that she wanted Mom and I to come with her down to her cellar to help her clean stuff out because she had a bunch of stuff down there that she wanted to have either moved or gotten rid of, I can't remember what. So Mom and I came in the house and went down with her, and then she went back out to the party and Mom went back out and left me down there by myself, which I wasn't scared or anything because her cellar is more like a room to me now than a cellar. And I thought I would never do this, but we slept in her cellar and I went down there a couple times without turning any lights on and it was okay because I just thought of it as a room in her house and I was going into a room where I could sleep. And I'm okay in open dark rooms, you know. And so, but anyway, in my dream there were lights on and stuff and it was okay, but there was concrete on the floor like a cellar. And I was going through clothes and baby toys and junk and stuff, and trying to put things in piles. And then I had a feeling like there was some, I didn't know why, but I had to get behind this rack of clothes and in behind this curtain. And I was fighting and fussing and fighting my way back there, and I finally got back there and there was like a little alcove with like a little stage and a big, huge keyboard back there. And I was thinking about how everybody was outside, and Mom was outside doing something with everybody. And so I was looking at it and studying it, and I was studying the control panel up at the top, and I saw that where there was like a power switch and display with m______ meters and a bunch of other stuff I didn't understand. And there was a volume knob at the far left, and I put it down like about it, and it felt big and kind of bulky like the ones on the stove are. And so I put it kind of down real low and then I turned the thing on, and this voice said, ""Please do not change any settings."" And it started playing like a demo song, but sounded like some kind of Rod Stewart theme or something like that. And I had the volume down as far as it would go and it was still like filling the room with sound, but I wasn't getting uncomfortable or anything; I was more like, ""Oh gosh, what did I do?"" [laugh] And then, before I knew it, I was kind of somewhere else doing something, and it was like there was a big -- what should I call it? -- it filled the cellar with sound and it was reverberating and everything. And next thing I knew, Bobby was down there with it and he moved it out of that place behind the curtain and put it out in the front of the room in the cellar, and he changed it to like a organ patch (?) and was playing a minor Halloween theme and doing scary laughs and jokes and stuff, as though we had an audience. And then I woke up."
"C-168"	"#C-168 (2004-07-24 (19)) Mom was babysitting again, and she had two or three kids sitting in the wagon, and you know you take the front of the wagon down and you use it like a bench? Well, that's what she was doing. And I had a feeling that they were kids that I knew, but I didn't really know their names, like I don't remember who they were, but I felt like I knew them. And there was this chicken that I was holding. I was over by the chicken cage sitting in the dirt where the truck usually parks, and I was holding this chicken that was a darker brown than a Rhode Island Red, like almost black. And I had a feeling like that chicken had been either abused or terrorized in another yard at another place, either by a dog or by a person. And I was petting this chicken, trying to calm her down, and she did calm down. And I was like talking to her and singing to her, and I was going to teach her how to be a petting zoo chicken for these kids. [laugh] And, you know, that was the whole point. I think there was more, but I don't remember what the heck else happened."
"C-169"	"#C-169 (2004-07-25 (19)) I was going with ten other people from Westport High School, and Melinda and Mom and two other people, to Disneyland. And I can't remember why, but, oh, because we only had ten people and four chaperones and it wasn't big enough to take the bus. And Mom was going to drive some people in our car. There was one other person driving that I didn't know, and Mom had me ride in Melinda's Mustang with her and two other people. And so we started out and she was driving and she had this teensy little unit in the front of her car, and, you know, she used to have, or in real life she probably still does have this booming sound system. So I don't know what was up with that dinky little, actually it was like a dinky little portable boom box that she just put in the front of her car. And we got to someplace to eat, and we stopped and we kind of diddled around; we didn't really eat. And then we kept going and we got to like an outside part of the park where we were going to just stop for a while and collect our sits, because we started out at 6:00 or so and it was late at night now. I can't remember if it was early in the morning or late at night, but we stopped there to kind of collect our wits. And we were all kind of assembling together and I, Mom gave me my mini disc recorder out of her bag, and she wanted me to put it on my person so that I would have it if I needed it. But I reminded her that to go into the park, we'd have to go through a metal detector and they might find it and they might think it was really weird. And she said, ""You're going to have to get used to this, blah, blah, blah,"" so I put it in my pocket and it had this long RCA to 1/8"" (?) adaptor on it and I kept trying to shove that in my pocket too, and it kept hanging out, which I don't know why I would need that if I'm not connecting it to my sound system here at home. And I can't remember if I kept it or I gave it back to her, but then, next thing I know, two of the kids from Westport High School are kind of shoving me into this shallow pool of water that only comes up to the middle of my calfs. And we walk around and this thing's got like a soft bottom like Oceanside pool, but I wanted to get out real fast because I heard there were prickly things and grates and other things in it. And, you know, the whole point of the dream was that we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled the day away, and we never got to go on any, go see any stuff in Disneyland. We just diddled. And I even, I rode home with Mom in her car, in our car, but we got home at like real late at night, and I was wanting to say, ""Let's go back; let's go back there and do some stuff on our own."" And she was like, ""Yah, do, do, do, do."" And then I woke up."
"C-170"	"#C-170 (2004-07-26 (19)) Samantha and Sandra and Derek and Jason were all in town, and Lee was there too. And I dreamt that there was sort of a new wave type of thing that the family was getting into, and it seemed like when any of them were together the only thing they could ever discuss and debate was how people should live if they are considered to be true Christians. And they would argue and debate over things, and one of the claims that one of them made was that you're never supposed to eat sheep meat, no matter what, that sheep are like the holiest symbol and you're never supposed to eat them. And it really isn't right to keep them in captivity, but a lot of people do. And I dreamt that there was this one lady that they talked about who would, you really weren't supposed to eat cat meat either, but she would like cut into the leg of her cat and take a little bit of meat off of him, and sew up the cut. Talk about gross! And the animal would live and she wouldn't want the neighbors to know that she was eating the meat of her cat, but she was, and the animal was still alive so it wasn't really obvious. And after all of that, I faded into another little scene that we were at a dock, at a boating ramp dock thing, and Dad was getting training through the Fire Department, along with some other guys, in how to drive these dinky little boats that would go fast one way and then would go really fast the other way in reverse. And I guess they were supposed to be used to look for people and stuff, but this boat was small enough that an adult person could lay down in the bottom of it and they would be touching either end of it with their head and their feet, almost a little bigger than a bathtub. So Mom and Dad were lounging back in the seat of this thing and they were going to start up the motor and start running around, and they got me in between them on board and it was sort of floating away from the dock, and they were going to start up the motor and start running it around and stuff. And I asked, ""Well, was it going to be as loud as the one we used to have?"" And they were like, ""Yeah."" So I sort of jumped out of the boat, which was really easy. All I had to do was just swing my legs over and I was in the water. And I swam back to the dock and I just laid on the dock and just let them drift away. And then I woke up."
"C-171"	"#C-171 (2004-07-27 (19)) I was at a courtyard place that they were going to have a concert, with Mom. It was a place that was sort of like The Amphitheater because it was a huge inclined thing with bleachers, and then at the back there was a drop-off and there was a courtyard down where people could mill around and shop and eat and stuff. And then there was another building, a few feet away from the first building, which had more bleachers on the roof so people could sit up there and still see what was on the stage. And I can't remember who was going to be in concert, but I think it was going to be somebody good. And I think we were milling around and stuff before the show and we were going to get something to eat. And we went into this building underneath the first set of bleachers, and we were looking around and talking to some people, and we were in a buffet thing. And it was like a buffet, but everything was labeled with a price. For example, one little quiche, which was the size of a quarter, was $3.00, and three stuffed mushrooms were $20.00. Even though it was so just like so expensive, we were like just sort of throwing things on our plate and we were going to like run out. And after we were done, after Mom was done filling up a plate for us, she'd like say, ""Come on, Jess, come this way,"" and she like disappeared. And I looked out in the hallway and all around the courtyard place, and I couldn't find her. And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, ""Here, let me help you pull up your stockings."" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, ""No thank you. I can do it myself."" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find Mom. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but Mom and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other. And then I woke up before the show ever started."
"C-172"	"#C-172 (2004-07-28 (19)) Was pretty complicated. First of all, I dreamt that Zane and Chelsea didn't really get legally married when I DJ'd their wedding when I was in 11th grade, but now they were getting legally married and I had to DJ a huge production that they were putting on to show everybody. And I spent like the whole day getting ready, sort of diddling around and feeling the adrenaline running through my system like it does. And I dreamt that I was in here and there was a musical keyboard where my typing keyboard is in this tray here. And there was like, instead of a tape machine and a mixer to the left of my monitor, or to the right (I'm not facing it, so I thought it was to the left for a minute), there was like the desk ended where the monitor was and there was like a whole pile of junk and stuff and boxes and junk. And Derek was sitting in my chair, and he pulled out my tray and he started like messing around and playing a riff (?) and stuff. And Mom was like getting all upset. And Mom was saying, ""Don't touch everything, Derek, you quit it."" And I'm like, ""He can touch it if he wants to."" And then after he did that, he like cleared out all the junk that was in there and dumped it all in Mom's room and put the case up there, back there where it was supposed to go, along with a little baby chair in there. And while all that was going on, I was trying to pack up like extra cables and like stands and stuff I take when I go on DJ gigs. And then I was going the day before over to Silas Cox's house, Silas and Sophia Cox were friends of Melinda's. And let's see, I'm wasting tape here. I was setting up the Peavey system and testing it and stuff the day before the wedding was actually supposed to happen because I wanted to see how the acoustics of the room where and how the layout was going to be and how I was going to run my wires because they wanted my table right in the middle of the room and I would just have wires going all over everywhere if I wasn't careful. And they had this like, this thing that kept evolving, and they kept telling me different information that was evolving. And at first I was packing up the Peavey system to take it home because the wedding wasn't for another day yet, but then and so I had it like underneath a little cover way overhang thing, and it was raining and pouring like crazy outside. And I was calling Dad on the cell phone and I was telling him that the wedding wasn't going to be tomorrow; it was going to be 5:00 today. And so I just needed to just sort of hang out here until then. And then they came out and they told me, ""Whoops! We need you to be here at 1:30, so just hang right where you are because we're going to do the ceremony here at 1:30, and then we're going to go at 6:00 over to the banquet hall, like called Banquet Masters, for the reception. And then they changed it yet again on me and they said, ""You need to be at the banquet hall at 1:30 for the ceremony, and you need to be back here at 6:00 for the reception."" And I'm getting all turned around, and I'm thinking, ""How in the heck am I going to get the Peavey system over to the banquet hall and set up before 1:30, and get it in there without people fussing too much?"" And then I woke up. I think that had something to do with the political convention that I saw on TV last night. I saw Teresa Heinz Kerry speak in that bright red dress, and in my dream Suzanne Cox was wearing the same kind of dress. I don't think there's anything else to it except I'm just thinking about how I'm going to function in this... [end] ."

In my dream Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there and a couple other people, maybe their significant others. And we were at Grammy's house, and except the stairwell wasn't the narrow thing that ours is; it was like, pstttt, I'm getting all screwed up. The stairwell wasn't a narrow thing like it is; it was wide like ours is. And I dreamt that Dad was just going to go and lay out in the back yard and not let anybody do anything for him or anything. And Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Mom and I were sitting upstairs in the upstairs room in Grammy's house and Samantha and Sandra kept asking, ""Why does he keep laying there? Why does he keep laying there?"" And Mom sat us all down and told us all why. And somebody said that he was laying there totally still, and that he looked like he was done. And then we were all emotional and crying and stuff, and saying all that we could have done. And then he stands up and comes in the house, and he has nothing but anger for all of us for even thinking of him in that way, even thinking that we could have done anything, even shedding a tear and having no comp______ of how it was. And then it was like we thought that he wasn't here any more and then he suddenly comes back to life. And then he went back outside and he sort of knelt down and laid down in the grass, and we had a feeling that was it then. And we were sad for a little bit, but we went on. We were all there together kind of doing things around to fix up the house and everything. And it's kind of funny because this house was like a combination of Grammy's house and our house, and the upstairs was like her house, but the downstairs was like our house, and it had our back yard and our stairwell. And the worst thing about this all is we were getting ready to have a party even, to celebrate me going off to Modern Media College, and we were going to invite all kinds of people. And we were supposed to make a party the day after all this was happening. And I had a feeling like I wanted us to celebrate something else besides me going off to school. And then I woke up about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, and I lifted my head, and I said, ""Thank goodness that is only a dream."" But it really didn't feel like a dream while it was going on; it felt so real. And there's not a lot of dreams that are like that. Most of them are too crazy to really feel real."

And they were taking a road trip up to this museum, and I don't think that they were going to steal anything, but they were going to confront somebody. I don't remember anything really about how the story went, but my ending that I was going to add was something like there was a third person that comes out of the woodwork that is the first person's brother and he doesn't know it. And those two were going to conspire to get the person and everything they had, and this guy was going to put butter all over his steering wheel and all over the handle of his gun so that anybody that, any cops that tried to take his car or anything wouldn't be able to keep a hold of the steering wheel.

Mom was saying how she's going to start taking some of my stuff away -- not my equipment, but like kid stuff, like my dolls and stuff, like if I was a kid. And I remember hiding a few of my best ones deep within the junk pile of my closet. And then I took a big kind of thick base and I held it above her floor in her room where she had a whole bunch of stuff scattered around, and I said, ""If you keep up this process, I'm going to break this vase in here and you're not going to have a vase and you're going to have a big bunch of glass to clean up.""

And I dreamt that I was going to sneak in, and I went in a door upstairs in the auditorium and I was thinking how I would sit on the balcony and watch it from the balcony, but the upstairs was different than the actual auditorium at Westport High School. It was more like a real theater where the balcony wasn't just across the back, but around the side. And I sort of pushed and ooched and scooted my way through some other people to get to the very edge front near the side. And I realized, ""Hey, ""I'm not going to see a darned thing from this position. What in the heck was I thinking?"" So I decided I had to go in the front way anyway or down to the front somehow, and I saw that there were a lot of empty seats near the front of the stage. So I was making my way down there, and then Ms. Judy from the Wilcox Center stopped me and said, ""Come with me; come this way; it'll be a lot less crowded."" And she led me around behind where the stage is and there's an elevator back there. We went down the elevator. And there we were boxed in a maze of hallways that were real colorful on the floors and stuff, like Modern Media College's hallways are, and they had these chandeliers and stuff on the ceiling and these secret little dressing rooms, VIP areas. But an assistant was telling me, ""Well, the school system gets away with this because they say it's being used for the students and their curriculum, and there's so much more square footage to air-condition, so they get more money from the County."" Anyway, we were winding through these hallways and I never did get back to the front of the auditorium to watch the play, but next thing I knew I was coming home and I realized I needed to go back for something. Oh, I know, somebody was going to be picking me up. I think it Mrs. Mauger from Oceanside, and in my dream I couldn't remember her name. And somebody was going to go pick me up and we were going to go see here, and I was going to bring some clothes and stuff that we didn't need any more. And then I woke up. That was crazy, man!"

And he's like, ""_____ you,"" some kind of comment like, ""You've got to be mean,"" or something like that. And I stood there, yelling, ""Help, help, help!"" But then I realized that instead of wearing myself out in the bathroom I should open the door and run around the bathroom, and I ran over to the main office and I told the lady what was happening. And I sort of had a feeling that he was chasing me, and what the lady did is she sat me down behind the desk so that he wouldn't be able to see that I was in there, and sure enough, he came in and he was looking for me.

Now the second one was that, you know, we really have a rheostat under our cabinets on top of our counter to control the level of the lights that are mounted up there. But in addition to that, I dreamt that we had a really big rheostat underneath the counter to control something else that was only supposed to be touched when the power was off. And I was thinking how I understand the relationship between power current and resistance, but I don't exactly know what aspect of it we actually pay for and is measured monthly. Well, in my dream Dad told me that we pay for how much current we use, but I know that reason tells me it's how much power we use, which is a combination of voltage and current. It took me a while before I got that! And he was having me check that little rheostat for the lights up there with a continuity checker that was all metal, and just had little things at the end. And I put it on each little screw of the rheostat and the light lit up full, and I took the thing off and it stayed full for about a minute or two and then it went dim again. That is woo-woo, man!"

Apparently we had been like having a party or something, like a neighborhood association, and I was starting to pack up the Peavey system and I went to put a cushion or something in the garage, and I got some seed and I noticed that in addition to our chicken, we now had like three or four ducks and two geese. And the ducks and geese were white and it was hard to tell them apart, and there were also one or two Muskogee ducks. And I was thinking, ""How cool is that!"" And I got the notion that somebody was moving out. Nobody told me, but I remembered Mom telling me in my dream that somebody had been moving out and gave us their ducks and geese to take care of. And they were really tame, and they were coming up to me and eating. And then I started packing up the Peavey system, and I realized that my power cord had been just severed, just like that, for some reason, and then I was on the front porch and I was calling the Peavey place to see if I could get an extra one. And Mom read me a serial number off of it that I copied down. And the person on the phone was asking me like, ""Well, did you step on it? Did something happen? What happened here?"" And all I could them was there was a bunch of commotion going on at this party and that's all I knew. And so then I went back out in the back yard and I realized that the severed cord wasn't the Peavey power cord, it was one of those extension cords. So then I continued packing up and I noticed that there was a keyboard on a stand next to my Peavey board table, and I had the notion that it was from the people that were moving out and they just kind of left it there. I kind of thought it was that, but I also kind of thought that maybe I had a musician at the party and they left it there. But anyway, I picked it up off the stand and wanted to carry it in the house and it was really heavy and I could barely its weight and mass. And I tried to open the door and I couldn't open the door, and I almost opened the thing. And I put it down and I opened the door, and I picked it up again. And I walked through the house, upstairs, and I slid it under my bed. And I don't remember going back to pack up the rest of the Peavey system, but I heard that later Mom and Dad were going to be going off somewhere for a little while, and I said, ""Yahoo!"" And I took it out again, and I set it on top, and then I realized that somebody had taken like really fancy beads and costume jewelry, like a really long necklace, and strung it like across the front of it. The necklace was just long enough to fit the width of the unit. And there was this _____ set of beads and charms and old b______ and stuff flopping around on its right side, hanging from the chain _______. [laugh] ___________________________. But then I realized that I felt guilty because I thought that the unit might be Oxama's, but then I kept having to remember that it was from those people who were moving out. It felt so weird to me. I said, ""Okay, this is probably not a dream,"" and then I woke up and I was like, ""Yes, it is."" [laugh] That was that."
"C-183"	"#C-183 (2004-08-18 (19)) I had a really dumb dream last night! I dreamt that Leslie lent me a guide dog for a few days to try it out and see how it worked, and it was this little tiny like the size of Carmen's little Chihuahua, and it was on a regular leash and just running all over and just not any good for anything. And then they replaced that one with Krystal, that was a black one, that was only a little bit bigger, and I was feeling guilty because the first two days I had forgotten to feed her. And then in a day or two it turned into a chicken, and it was a chicken and I was feeding a chicken and stuff. And somewhere mixed in to all this I dreamt that my receiver's power switch was going to heck, and at certain indiscriminate times in the middle of the night it would just turn itself out and just blast. And I had to unplug it to keep it from doing that. [laugh] And then the plug was starting to come apart and stuff and I was really having a problem."
"C-184"	"#C-184 (2004-08-20 (19)) It wasn't really Halloween, but for some reason people were like dressing up and doing crazy stuff like that. And there were some kids from the neighborhood, big tall kids, dressed up as Ursula and for some reason the spell I remember that wasn't really in the movie was that Ursula had a seashell locket with a voice in it. She could cut somebody's foot and make them sing the song, and then she would draw their voice into the shell. And then here's the strangest part of all: Samantha and Sandra and Derek were like touching me and beating me up in the bathtub, trying to get me to sing a Led Zeppelin song I didn't even know. And Derek had a dog, like a Dalmatian, that would just go nuts every time somebody would enter into the room. Oh, and the person dressed up like Ursula who was trying to put spells on people, in my dream I took a lantern and I whacked and whacked and whacked the person's face with the lantern, thinking that I was going to get all the spell power out of Ursula. And Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that is all for this tape. I'm not going to be able to put another thing on this tape, so that's it."
"C-185"	"#C-185 (2004-08-21 (19)) I was going on a trip with Mom and Dad and two other strange girls, and we had to go on a train or a bus and we were going to some foreign city in the middle of the country. And I had a seeing-eye dog, but I had absolutely no training in what to do and how to do it. I only knew a few things that I had to do, and so I'm trying to manage this big dog and keep him under control, and get in this bus and this train. And then I switched to another scene suddenly where we were in a hotel room with Mom and Dad and these two strange girls, and it was a really small, like one-bedroom room, like they are. And the carpets were red, and the walls were kind of bleah, yellowy. And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do. And Dad wasn't really playing the game. He was laying down in front of the bed, so whenever we were walking around, we had to step over him. And I was remembering how I was putting my personal stuff under the bed because I didn't want the two strange girls messing it up. And I don't remember too much about what words we were making in the game, but one of the girls like laid near my stomach and sat on my back and like waved a paint brush between my legs, and I was so scared because I couldn't kick; I couldn't get her off of me and I was afraid of what she was going to do to me. And, let's see, was there anything else? I don't think so. That was all there was."
"C-186"	"#C-186 (2004-08-22 (19)) I had this red book that I was looking through. It was little and the pages were kind of thick cardboard. And it had these scenes from like in a church, of like praying girls and angels, and it was showing you like what you're supposed to do when you like get communion and stuff. And there was black print under a red background, _______ that's under. And I was looking through that book, and while I was looking through that book, I had a lockable diary that I had opened, and I started writing in it, ""Okay, I have found this book, and now I'm going to tell a story."" And I was deciding what story I was going to tell. Oh, my gosh! [thunder sounds] Getting closer! So before I wrote anything more in this diary book, there was a tape that came with the red book of like prayers and stuff, and the tape had like a choir singing and then a background accompaniment and a girl speaking. And what you had to do was, they put the girl speaking in the left panel and the accompaniment music in the right panel so that you could turn the balance knob and adjust mix pretty much. Well, Mom's boom box was plugged in, in my room here, and it had LED's on the front, which is something that hers doesn't. And it had LED's on the front and it had ______ meters, and I played the tape and I was adjusting the balance knob, adjusting the mix, even though in reality her boombox doesn't have a balance knob, and man, it got me really excited in an embarrassing way. And I went in the bedroom, and then I woke up."

And there was this big thing, like I was climbing these rocks, and trying to get over this thing, this wall. And then I was in a bathroom and I was climbing on this toilet and then climbing on the paper towel thing up onto the edge of the stall so that I could climb out the window. I never really made it out the window because I realized I couldn't get there. And the toilets really stunk in the bathroom. And then I can't remember what else. I think I was going into some other cave thing, like there was a little bonfire in there and it was a really cool little scene that was set up there. And that's all."
"C-188"	"#C-188 (2004-08-28 (19)) I was back in the Westport High School building, but everybody acted like they were taking college classes. I was in this class where we weren't really doing a whole lot of work. Then I was kind of pretty much just finishing a couple things and handing them to the teacher, and then trying to go through and organize, and I had that black g______ thing that I bought for Modern Media College and I had my book bag and I had three or four big bulky magazines on my desk. They were like women in business magazines and stuff. And [laugh] we had a duck and cover drill where ____ said, ""Okay, _________"" and instead of everybody having their own desk, I was jammed in with four other people and I could hardly breathe. And I sat up before it was time because I just couldn't stand it any more. And then everybody went back to normal doing their thing, and people were just sort of leaving whenever they wanted to, just like a college class, they finished what they were doing. And actually they were going to take a lunch break and then they were going to come back and do some more. Well, I thought I was going to leave all my stuff there and just go take a break. So I went with these two visually impaired people. One seemed really competent and one seemed really, ""duhhhhhh."" And they were talking to me as we were walking up and down the halls, and we were thinking about going to the cafeteria, but I decided I wanted to go get my stuff first. And I said I was going to meet them down in the courtyard. And I met the teacher at the door and the teacher said, ""Oh no, you can't come back in here; we had a fire drill. They aren't letting people back in yet."" And I was like, ""My stuff's in there."" And then I woke up."

And she was at our house and she was kind of playing for us a little bit, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were kind of partying around. And for some reason I was laying on the pallet in front of Dad's desk and I was like opening the drawer to Dad's desk, shuffling around until I found my tape machine and hitting ""record"" so that I could record what was going on. Well, instead of recording, it just played. It just played whatever was on the tape, and it was kind of a little on the wild side, and Samantha was sitting right there on the chair next to me and could see everything I was doing. And then we were walking in the park and I dreamt that I had a watch that could record what was going on too, and in order to get the sound ________ phone and that was really a bad deal! [laugh] But then at the end Sandra was saying to Dad how they were going to introduce me to one of their friends, but they weren't going to do it tonight, it was probably going to be too late. ""I think we should do it tomorrow,"" is what she was saying. And I was all set and ready to do it that night, but I said, ""We only have a few days; let's make the most of them."" And then I woke up."
"C-190"	"#C-190 (2004-08-31 (19)) Was a real hodgepodge of different scenes. First of all I dreamt that Mom and I were going to this concert that was put on by this band. It was kind of a blah band, but for some reason we liked them. And it was being held at the Pier because it was a benefit for some kind of senior thing, and it was like an outside thing where you see out in a little café and you listen to them. Well, I was wondering, well, why can't they be at our pier sometime, at the Westport pier, and at the Bayfront Pier other times. And let's see, I don't remember exactly what, but Mom had me take a cab home from downtown Westportrsburg, and when I got, _____ and the lady was real friendly that drove me. But when I got home, she said it was like $50, and I only had like a ten and a couple ones, so I ran inside and I got some more. And I gave it to her and I was just so distraught, I couldn't believe I took a $50 cab ride, which, you know, from downtown back to here would probably only be $10 or $15 on an average. And then we were back to the Bayfront Pier, getting ready to hear this band, and it started to rain and lightning and thunder, so we went inside this library and we sat around a while. And that's about it."

So she was in our car and we were taking her up to like __________. And then it kind of shifted to that I was going to do a second year at Westport College for some reason. And I had a music class with a woman that I went to, and she was having us like go around the room and sight read out loud, you know, like you read out of any other book. And this room was like big and open and it had tables with all kinds of stuff that we sat at. And the floor was yellow, kind of like linoleum, _________________, and let's see, she was having us paint these little rolls for some reason. I can't tell you what that had to do with it, other than it was a sort of melding into being an art class. And when that class was over, Mom had my schedule and she was waiting outside for me. And I didn't know what else I had to do in the day and I was kind of nervous because I knew I was just going to miss a class because that music class went over so long. And, let's see, oh, she read my schedule out loud to me, and I had that class first and then three personal fitness classes, and then something else. And I asked if she would take me around and show me where they all were, and she's like, ""Well, I really don't have time; can we do it another day?"" And I said, ""Well, the least you could do is mark that paper for me."" And she's like, ""Well, there's not a copy machine here, so let's go home and maybe we'll get over to the hardware store sometime. And then I woke up."
"C-192"	"#C-192 (2004-09-03 (19)) I don't exactly know what to make of. First of all I dreamt that Mom was upstairs and she had her drawing counter cleared off, and it was about twice the size that it really is. And I dreamt that she was going to operate on somebody and she was going to give them like some kind of extra organ in their body. And she said she was going to give them a natural toy, whatever that means. And at the same time, I was messing with something else trying to get it to work. And then I kind of shifted scenes to the fact that we were in a hospital, and Mom was having some kind of heart attack or something like that, and she was like having trouble breathing. And I can't remember exactly how it all unfolded, but there were some kind of doctors there and everything, but in a matter of a little while they said that she was alright and they wheeled out, and I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there. And we were all sitting in chairs that were rolling, and we were wheeling her down the aisle and out the door. And somebody said, ""We've had enough nervousness; let's go to a place where we can relax."" So we were at this place that I thought could be Six Flags; it was a big open-like type space. And there were various sidewalks that kind of intersected at places, and they ran into these buildings that I could see off in a distance that I thought had things in them. And I thought that there was more park beyond the buildings. And I was rolling in my chair still, and I rolled it backwards up the hill and then I let it roll all the way down the hill. And then I rolled it over to a little bathroom station like thing, and I was wondering, ""Now where in the world did Mom and Dad go?"" And they were with two other people, I can't figure out who, and I was just thinking how I was either going to have to go to a pay phone and call Dad's cell phone and say, ""Where the heck are you?"" or I was just going to go enjoy the park myself. But I was thinking how I wasn't going to be able to find anything in the park, and how I didn't know how to get exactly past those buildings to more of the inner, inside part of the park. You know how theme parks have a big area where you just sit and wait as an entrance, and there's the actual thing inside. Well, that's kind of how this was. And that's really all there was to it."
"C-193"	"#C-193 (2004-09-05 (19)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, but for some reason things kept getting put off and delayed and scaled back and pushed back and bumped back, and nothing really got done. Then we were going to make some fancy egg salad, and we had to put these real sour things in. I sort of had the notion that they were like poison ivy, but they were okay once you cook them. So I was out there cutting these flowers and leaves from these stems that somebody had picked, and I was trying not to let the chickens get them because I knew that they were bad for the chickens. And at this point we had a buff chicken and a dark chicken. But they would jump up on the table and they would lean down and they would snatch a few pecks anyway.

"C-194"	"#C-194 (2004-09-06 (19)) We were coming down the Interstate to go somewhere and it was Mom and I, and we were in the truck.

And I was laying near her, and we were in the cab. And then I told her, ""Now watch for the exit, because it can really go quick when we come to the exit."" Well, she wasn't ready at the time and the exit came up, but the truck sort of went down the exit by itself, and she was just all nervous and jumpy because she didn't think the truck had any brakes. But it did. And we went to the parking lot at the store that I was pretty sure she had to stop at. I don't remember too much more about that. But then, all of a sudden, we were in this house that was like an artsy show house, but I had the notion that they were wanting to sell it, but they were holding a benefit dinner there for some kind of charity. And Samantha and Derek were there, and they were having this dance thing, like meters and strobe lights on the porch, and I couldn't really go there yet because we were waiting in line for the dinner thing. And then it kind of quieted down and the porch was like empty and it was daytime, and I was in line and I had my plate finally and I was going to a place at the table to sit down. And one of the ladies asked me a question right when I was taking a bite, and they said, ""Jasmine, spit out your food and look at me before you talk."" One of the old crazy ladies that was giving the thing. She expected me to spit out my food instead of talk with a mouthful. And the thing of it was, somehow I got in the line at this food place ahead of Mom, but I wanted to sit next to her because I got this huge plate and I wanted her to share it with me. I think we could only pay for one plate and we were going to share it. And so I think the lady even said something like, ""You need to sit next to your father because he came to dinner with you."" But my dad wasn't there; it was just my Mom and me. And then the lady decided she's going to get me out of the prissy dinner scene by taking me to see another little like mother-in-law house attached to this place. And she kept _________ this next, oh what should I say, across a little boardwalk and into this little house. And I noticed a porcelain teapot that wasn't fired yet that had all kinds of little beadwork on it, and I like pressed it against my face and smelled it. And when I took it away, my mouth had the beads on it, and I had to hurry up and try to scrape the beads off it so the lady wouldn't see. And then I woke up."
"C-195"	"#C-195 (2004-09-06 (19)) I had another crazy dream last night earlier and when I woke up at 2:00 in the morning, I remembered it.

And they had different mp3 files attached to them that would play when you opened them. And one had this awful, ""Doo, do, doo, do, doo, do"" attached to it and I had to remember which one it was because I didn't want to open it and hear that sound. And for some reason that sound would go even if the speakers weren't turned on, and it was just like you couldn't get away from it. And I wasn't really scared in this dream, but it was more of afraid that I would be scared kind of a thing. But I don't know where in the heck that came from except we were moving all the hardware down the hall into the bedroom yesterday, and I was wrapping up the wires and looking down behind the desk and all that, in the dust bunnies and stuff. And it was neat to see and get to do most of the connecting and stuff for myself, and get to practice that a little. But that was that."
"C-196"	"#C-196 (2004-09-10 (19)) I was attending this school put on by DVS, and there were three or four of the counselors that were there.

And they were giving like seminars all day about different things. And it was pretty hot. And I was walking around there in long pants and shoes and socks and I was walking around with this girl that was supposed to be like a buddy to me, but I couldn't figure out who she was or what she was doing. And so I'm walking around with her and I go back to Carolyn's classroom where I was supposed to be. And then I realized I'm in sandals and I'm walking around in sandals, and before you know it, I'm barefoot and I'm coming back to Carolyn's classroom and I'm kind of self-conscious about going into class barefoot, but it's kind of a thing where I know it's going to be kind of something people are going to notice, but I also had a tape recorder that they gave us for class, and they told everybody about be discriminative when you record because we only had a 90-minute tape and we were listening to lectures and blah, blah, bleah, going on and on and on for like six hours that day. So that was that."
"C-197"	"#C-197 (2004-09-12 (19)) I really can't remember which of these scenes came first, but I'll try to just cover them all somehow. I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, again, and I was at this school campus with them that was sort of an unconventional large, sprawling campus. I couldn't figure out if it was Modern Media College or Westport College or Westport High School, but I think it had elements of a little bit of each, and it was just sort of a school that represented a little bit of each one. And to start off with, I was at this show with them, there was this big tent that was like, that was their cafeteria, and they had long wooden tables and we were going to eat something and watch this show. And they had huge light-up, blow-up things like you see at Halloween and Christmas now of Sesame Street characters and other little animals and things that would sort of float up to the top of the tent, and they would talk and sing and there would be three of them up there dancing around at a time. And they had these high, squeaky, kind of cartoony voices. And I can't remember what the significance of that was, but I think it was starting to rain and the show kind of ended, and I was walking around this campus with like Derek was there. And it was starting to thunder, and I was thinking how I should get into the main building at Westport High School so that I would be out of the rain and thunder, but having a concern that the thunder might set off the fire alarm and it might be a real problem because here in a building and it's pouring down rain, and that happens, you can't run outside obviously and you're just sort of stuck there. But I wasn't too afraid of that, and once that part kind of subsided, Samantha, Sandra and Derek were going to hang out in the big tent some more and I sort of had the notion that there was going to be another show, but it was going to be sort of on the scary side. And so I walked up some outside stairs of a building that had a lake in front of it, and I had keys and I had the notion that I was going into my apartment. And I was standing on the balcony kind of waving bye to them, and then I went in my door. And then -- this is the craziest part of all, and I think this is the last part -- you know that Santa mechanical that we have for Christmas? Well, I think his right hand is in a fist and he has a candle in his left hand and opening he has a baby. Well, in my dream both of his hands were in fists and his left hand had a light and his right had just had a gap for something to go in. And I think Ms. Jameson, my preschool teacher, appeared in all of this somewhere, and she gave me this candy cane, this fake candy cane with a fake Styrofoam present and some holly tied to it to put in the hand of my Santa figure. But she warned me that it came with a scary song that had a lot of ""oo"" words in it, and that I shouldn't open it and use it, that I should give it to somebody who didn't have that problem. [laugh] And how that goes together, I can't even begin to tell you. But I can't remember. I think I gave it to Derek and he told me he wasn't going to open it in front of me, but then I got curious and I opened it, and I put the candy cane in his hand and what it is, is when you put it in his hand and turn the figure on, it makes it play that song instead of a Christmas song. And I think it went something like, ""_______________"" [singing] Now that's a song I would hear the kindergarteners do when I was doing Braille with Ms. Garland back in 4th grade. We were in that little room by the kindergarten pod, and I don't know what made me bring it up now. And I remember thinking about that and not really being scared, but sort of being puzzled as I sort of faded into consciousness. And that was that."
"C-198"	"#C-198 (2004-09-15 (19)) Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Christina and Danny were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stanley, and I think I should say that the significance of Stanley's name is that in Sound & Vision there's a man named Stanley who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stanley was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere mike on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stanley came in and he said, ""Did you get it?"" He told me, ""I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters."" And he said, ""I even ran the siren; did you get that?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get that either."" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stanley played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when. And I think the part about the dancing and singing play comes from me thinking a lot about the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas, and how I would love to read a book about everything that went into that show and everything that they did, and how they decided to do just what they did."
"C-199"	"#C-199 (2004-09-17 (19)) Man, where are the days going? Last night I had a really crazy dream that felt so real. The main point of it was that Suzy was going to perform at Disneyland, and she had three free tickets, and she was going to give one to her brother, one to Mom and one to me, if we could go. And it was like I knew that it was Thursday night, and according to my dream, we would be off down the Interstate by this morning. And ironically I saw in The Weekender that Celine Dion was going to be there at the park the same night. In fact, Suzy was going to open for her. And there was all kind of hoopla about there was this lady that was putting a house together that would fit the pampered diva and all that stuff, and then I realized that I really should call Suzy just to make sure the tickets really were free and we didn't have to pay anything because she heard something about, ""Well, if you guys can come up with $45, then you can go,"" or something like that. And so I was trying, it was like real late at night, and I called and I left her a message. And then I was kind of fading into consciousness and realizing that it was a dream. And last night I never did, I mean, the night before I never did get around to recording that one. I dreamt that, first, I was in the kitchen with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and a couple people from my chorus class, and we were all in these black robes and we were going to sing a song in the kitchen. And this teacher lady had a keyboard set up on the counter, and it was plugged into that outlet by the toaster, and she was going to accompany us. And next thing I knew, I was in this music class with this teacher, and the chorus was all singing, and for whatever reason, I had to work on this typing practice program. You know how they give you these typing exercise drill things? Well, I was working on a program like that on a computer that was set up on a rolling cart in the middle of the floor. This room was just huge. And apparently I was doing pretty good with the typing program because the teacher came over and said, ""Okay, I think you're ready for something else now."" And Mom was there, and did something else, I don't remember what. But the teacher was going to sort of put her class on hold and go and try to find a midi (?) program and see if she could make it work. And while she was gone, I noticed that in this sort of trashy box there were several unopened tapes and CD's. There were cards with song words on them, and there were ten tubes of wrapping paper that were just going to be thrown in the garbage. So I was like trying to pile that stuff in my book bag without the other kids seeing, and trying to save it from the garbage, because it was really good stuff. And then I woke up."
"C-200"	"#C-200 (2004-09-23 (19)) The first one I know was very interesting as it started out, but I only remember bits and pieces of it now. But the craziest main thing that I remember was that I had the notion that before I had the ability to scan pictures, I could actually take the vacuum cleaner and not actually vacuum the picture up into the vacuum cleaner, but I could let it just kind of get like sucked up towards the brush and make a really, really funny sound and just hover there for a little bit. [laugh] And I had the notion that somehow I connected the vacuum cleaner to the computer with a USB cable, but somehow the picture would get over there. Oh, my gosh, how crazy. But then the bad part of the dream was that Sandra was in town with her baby -- that wasn't the bad part. And I was going up to our little attic, which is like a third level of our house, to pack some stuff for me to go. And I was packing up the crazy vacuum cleaner and a couple other things, and I laid down on my back and I fell asleep with the light on and the ladder down. Well, in my dream, either Quinn -- which is Sandra's stepdad -- or me shut the light off and closed the ladder thing and was going to try to kill me by leaving me up there. And so in my dream I wake up and I'm in this thing and the ladder is up and the light is off, and I'm like terrified, with a capital T. And I'm yelling and yelling, and finally Sandra comes and then opens the ladder and lets me get down, and I was kind of singing as she was getting me down the ladder, you know, the song from B_____, ""Come and rescue me,"" and I think she carried me as though I was still light enough to be carried. And that's really all I can remember. But I don't know why, I mean, I guess we should say that in that little attic is the only place that I'm really afraid of heights. And I've never really been afraid of heights as a rule, but when I go up that ladder and I'm moving around in there, I just go so slowly and so carefully, even though there's a lot of room because I just don't like looking down that ladder for some reason. And I don't think anybody would suffocate in there because there's plenty of insulation, so I don't know what that was about."
"C-201"	"#C-201 (2004-09-23 (19)) And the second crazy dream I had was about a little while later, after I went pee, and in this dream I don't know how I was there, but I was with Mom and we were kind of at a backstage area of like a beauty contest, and these ladies were coming through all dressed up with their little helper kids. And they were getting presents and leaving them backstage in their areas and going on, filing on through. And they were stopping in this kitchen where we were, and one of our neighbors was there, and I think Mom and I were cooking food. And Aunt Christine had this -- I felt like Aunt Christine was going to come through this beauty line, and she never did. And the next thing was that we were here in my bedroom and it was daylight, Mom pulls out a little portable radio from when the girls were here. It was like theirs. And she turns it on and it's like, she's just talking to it, ""I miss Jackson,"" and stuff like that. [laugh] That was weird. But then we were like walking, and we said, ""Let's walk to the capital,"" and I'm like, ""Okay,"" and so we're 15 minutes around and we cross a little bridge diagonal like across some kind of water and we're in this nature park and area that she tells me is Bestin (?). And there's this man with his bird that got loose and almost runs in front of a car, but I was saying to her, ""If it only takes us 15 minutes to walk to Bestin, then why does it take us 3 hours or nearly 8 hours to drive there?"" That was messed up, man!"
"C-202"	"#C-202 (2004-09-24 (19)) Terri was taking a photography class and she was learning all about different color compositions and stuff like that, and she was showing us a package of pictures that she took. And there were two or three pictures of Celine Dion, there were tons of pictures of flowers, there were one or two pictures or like sunsets and things, and I guess -- I don't know -- but I guess she was going to pay me to scan some of them for her. And I was telling her she didn't have to pay me, but the thing was that, oh, I know -- I asked her, ""How many pictures do you want, and what size?"" And I asked her how many. And she thought I was saying, ""How much are you going to give me?"" But she took quite an amount of time making up her mind which ones she wanted, and she just kept sitting there, thumbing through them and saying, ""Well, maybe this or maybe not, maybe not, maybe not,"" you know, like Mom does. And I got the mail, and this thing came in the mail, this funny envelope thing from Modern Media College and it was real classy. And it was this box. It said, ""2003-2004"" on it, and it was this box that was real pretty and real classy, and you just put things in it, I guess. And that was all there was to it. And I was noticing, as I looked at it, it kind of changed, and I noticed that on the bottom it said, ""Westport Town Center"" instead of ""_____ Park."" And there were little flowers and there was sort of an indention in the middle of it. And then I woke up."
"C-203"	"#C-203 (2004-09-26 (19)) The day that's supposed to be my going away party, but just listen to the wind outside! The hurricane's going to make my party go flop. But anyway, I had a crazy dream last night. I dreamt that I was in my apartment and I was having some visitors over as an apartment-warming party, and it was really an odd type of a place, and as I was walking around through it, I was feeling like, ""This is not what I had in mind. I had a more normal place in mind."" First of all you had to go up three steps and duck to get in the front door. It was almost like climbing in a window. And there was a couch right in front of it, so it was like a window instead of a front door. And then the bedroom had somebody else's stuffed animals in it, and it had kind of a small and bleah bed, and there was like a shelf mini sound system up on top, like in order to touch it, you had to stand on tippy toes on the bed, but you had a remote control that you could sit somewhere and control it with. And it sounded kind of old and kind of bleah, and you would press a certain button the remote control and it would act as a remote controller for the washing machine. And it had a little laundry chute where you would put the clothes, that was white, right next to the black sound array setup. And you'd put the clothes in and then you would use the sound system remote to control what the clothes have to do in the washing machine. How bizarre! How bizarre! And then Mom wanted to take me down to the cellar to see what the washing machine was doing, and I just did not want to go. I was scared to death to go in the cellar, and that's really all I can remember about that dream. And then I woke up because I thought somebody was knocking on my door, but it was the stupid window banging on the awning. The wind was blowing it around. I dreamt that we were at the park and Mom was playing one of my mixed CD's on her boom box, which it really doesn't sound that good, but it did in my dream, and I was sitting in a banyan tree. And then I came down and we were laying on a blanket and somehow Dad found one of my diary books and happened to open it up to kind of an innocuous passage about being in the park and climbing the tree, and he read it out loud, which I let because I knew there was nothing in that passage. And then he turned the page and he came to something about how hard to get along Aunt Joyce is and I made him close the book. And he was suggesting in my dream that he wanted me to scan these pages so that they wouldn't be on paper any more. ""I don't understand,"" he says, ""a person who doesn't think too much technology in somebody's life, gidgets and gadgets, is a good thing."" But he's got this thing against having stuff on paper. [laugh] I don't know what it is, but in my dream he was wanting me to scan those pages in my diary so they wouldn't be on paper any more. And I told him, ""It doesn't do OCR for handwriting. It probably will ______, there'll probably be an update and then I will, but not now. It doesn't do OCR for handwriting."" Well, he didn't care; he wanted me to. So before I woke up, in my dream I was sitting there trying to do the thing, and I was getting a little tangled up and I wasn't sure where I was going and what I was doing. And then I woke up."
"C-204"	"#C-204 (2004-09-28 (19)) I was already at Modern Media College for orientation, and we were in this room that had yellow floors in a lightly lit area and blue floors in a darker area. And in the yellow floor area there were some desks and chairs and line up things like bowling alleys, and over the blue floor area there were various -- actually there was only one in this area -- a little work station area with a mixing board and a bench to sit at in front of it and a bench to sit at a few feet back. And it wasn't really a graded test, but the instructor was going to give us a test that we had to go up to the board, figure it out, connect the wires where they needed to go, make all the mix and let him listen to it and just to see kind of, get to know the equipment kind of like. And R_____ and I were going to be a team. And in my dream she was sort of semi-hefty and wearing blue. And in my dream she said that, ""Always Be My Baby"" was her favorite song. And I can't remember what we were going to play through the board, but I ran my hands all over the board, and I wasn't shy about it, and I remember bringing the masters down before I went to feel the connections in back. And there was this digital bit of cable laying next to it that I had the notion was supposed to be used for a mike input, and it was supposed to work like an XLR, but it wasn't. We had to jam it into one of the places where an XLR went. That was crazy. And so I connected it to the board and to the mike, and it was making this really awful sound. And I realized that the instructor had tied a knot in it just so we would have to discover it and untie the knot. And then it was better. And then after that, I was on the porch swing telling Mom about it, and in my dream I was feeling really confident and ready for anything basically. "
"C-205"	"#C-205 (2004-10-01 (19)) I was at this class with Ophelia in college, and it was more of a linguistics class than a Spanish class because we were given these sheets with pictures and _____ with _________s. And they had pictures and they had sentences that, oh my gosh, were comprised of Spanish words and Italian words and German words and French words all mixed around. There was even some Latin thrown in. And we had to discern the meaning of the sentence based on the familiarity with the Latin bases in each language and look at the picture. Oh yeah, and there were some blanks in the sentence too. And we had to fill in the blanks with Spanish words because that was the only foreign language that we had expressive and receptive skills in. And then we had to write our own sentences, and I don't remember being able to discern too well what the pre-made sentences were. But then I wrote, we wrote some of our own sentences, and one of the sentences was, ""Dwight and his girlfriend had keys to the bathroom because they had to go really bad. Then they got locked in."" [laugh] Now where that came from, I don't know, but I remember I was working on another one of those, and we were at the airport. Mom and I were supposed to go on a plane somewhere, I think, and I was working until like the last minute to finish that thing. You know how I do sometimes. And then I had to, I really did have to go to the bathroom, and, well, come to think of it, I wasn't going anywhere with Mom; I was going with this class. And I had to go to the bathroom, and in this line of bathroom stalls, they had stalls with doors that closed, and they had empty toilets facing sideways in front of the doors. And so I sat on one of the empty toilets in front of the doors, and the door was open, and Dad said, ""Try and move over in here; I've got to go too."" And he went in the stall and closed the door, and here I am sitting on the toilet in front of the door. I guess he Athought it was more politically correct to see a woman going to the bathroom than to see a man going. And as I'm trying to go, somebody in the airport comes out and starts talking to this class about what they're going to do when and what flight they're going to take and what city they're going to stop in and giving them directions. And I noticed that they were all sitting real close to me, and I'm like in the audience. I'm just on a toilet instead. And so I'm standing up and trying to pull up my pants and I feel a little embarrassed. And then I woke up."
"C-206"	"#C-206 (2004-10-04 (19)) I was at this market, kind of like a meat frozen thing, except it was outside. And there was like fake snow on the ground in this one area, and there were these ducks and geese that were alive, and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't see them at first, because I could only just sort of barely make them out because I was not really that close. And then as I got closer, I realized that all the geese, their big bodies, were jammed into these little buckets, meaning their heads and their chest were sticking out, but their tail and their feet and their bottom were just squeezed and, what should I say, twisted and just shoved into these little buckets so that they couldn't get out. All they could do was just sit there and look at people, which I guess the point was they have their heads up to have them looking at people. But man, what a way to do it. And I think a few of the ducks were like that too, but there were a few of them that were free and were running around, and they were mallards. And I caught a mallard that was pretty tame, and I held it for a while and then I let it go back to the market thing. And that was one little scene. And in my dream I didn't feel too bad about it. I wanted to pull them all out and set them free, but I had a feeling like it was against the law to set them free because they were like livestock, I guess. And the next little scene was that Mom and I were in the garage and, you know, we were kind of whispering and stuff. And Dad heard us whispering about how Mom thought he was going to get rid of her, and he came in and said something like, ""Oh, is that what you talk about. Why do you give her that impression?"" or something like that, and, you know, all like that. And then I think Sandra was in town and we were riding bikes or something, and her and Dad were riding on the tandem and Mom and I were walking and we were just lagging way behind. And then I woke up."
"C-207"	"#C-207 (2004-10-07 (19)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town. They were staying in this kind of house that wasn't ours, and it had wood floors and it had a lot of windows, but it was smaller than ours. And the main thing about this dream that I can remember right now was that Derek had this red car that was really new-fangled, and he designed this type of alarm that was to warn people around that a person was having an epileptic seizure, but in order to activate it, the windshield had to be cracked and the two front doors had to be open. And it wasn't a ""whoo whooey"" kind of sound; it was a dark, heavy -- I don't know how to describe it -- kind of lower frequency and a horn kind of an alarm. And it was a few decibels louder than the norm. And I dreamt that he was wanting to demonstrate it to everybody and everybody was wanting to see it, and they sort of told me, ""Oh, it's not going to happen. I'm just going to show you what makes it happen."" But I knew better. I was out on the porch with them, and I opened the door and I ran in the house. And the bedroom was close to where the car was parked, so I ran in the living room, I laid face down on the couch and covered my ears. And I heard it a little bit, but it wasn't bad. Then I went back out and I think there was more to this dream in that these, this scene with the car that he had designed had something else to do with audio also, but I can't remember exactly. And it had to do with this round thing that was part of the engine, and if it got too hot, it was a problem. But I don't remember any more. Oh, and another thing was that Dad took me to this place, this 18 key place, and I took my cell phone to ask a question about something on the bill because the bill was like $96 and usually in reality it's only $26. And I couldn't figure out what in the heck was going on. And I think that was all. Now there's something else I remembered about that dream. I also dreamt that there was a white chicken and another chicken that was white with black speckles, and I realized I had a notion they had been sitting in boxes for days, live chickens just sort of confined in little cardboard boxes about twice their size. And they were light and thin, they seemed way too light for their sizes. And I figured it was high time that we let them run in the yard, and I wanted to keep a close eye on them to see if our other chickens would accept them or if they would go crazy and peck them and shoo them. And I really don't remember what happened, but I remember them walking away from the boxes and doing just fine."
"C-208"	"#C-208 (2004-10-08 (19)) I say that because it makes no sense at all. I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were at town, and we were up at some place like Clementine Springs or some kind of p_____ park or nature preserve or something like that, but I had a feeling it wasn't exactly Clementine Springs, but it was another name like S_______ Springs. And let's see, what happened first? Samantha, Sandra, and Derek and Teresa and Paula and Patricia, and they all went off to do something, and they were splashing and ______ing in the springs and stuff, and shooting down the river, and Mom and Dad and I were sitting at an area that really closely resembled Circle Lake Park. And we were just sitting there, like quiet, and we were just talking about different things. And we were gazing into the water and we saw like these reflections in the water that were like people with instruments. And Mom said, she said, ""I saw an advertisement that was for a keyboard that could make the sound of all the instruments that were ever created, for only something like $50. Now that can't be. It would have to be really kind of cheap."" And Dad was right there, and I think she said, ""I'll show it to you, but you have to do your homework first."" And apparently this was like back when, I don't know, but I had the notion that I had some homework to do. And it was like math, it was this really simple -- oh, before any of this -- now it's coming back to me: I dreamt that I was in a class and these college kids were so dumb, they didn't know their times tables. And this math teacher was trying to drill the times tables into these kids my age. And so, back to the scene that I was talking about, we had multiplication homework that was like really basic, except in some of the problems there wasn't numbers. There were little fish symbols, and I didn't know what to make of them. And then some were normal and some were stupid things like 1 X 12 and 0 X 4 and stupid stuff like that. And also there was one really challenging one though that was 23 X 63. And I was thinking, ""Okay, how do I do this one? I don't the space to write it out, and I don't have a calculator. So, okay, I can do 9 X 23 and then do 7 X 23 and add those two numbers together and that would be the answer to what 63 X 23 is."" And then I woke up."
"C-209"	"#C-209 (2004-10-09 (19)) Mom and I were shopping at this little store in downtown somewhere. We were on a trip somewhere and I don't remember where we were. And I dreamt that we stepped outside and we saw these two like plumes of smoke in the east, and that kind of symbolized something. I think it symbolized Lorna and Reyna and how they kind of stand together, and in my dream, instead of all the way, there was sort of a reddish colored CD called ""This is It"" with, there were two figures on the front, naked. And, of course, that doesn't actually exist, but it was right after talking about love, kind of as a farewell thing for a while. And so I was going to go over and investigate what in the world that was, and it was like a fancy, exclusive hotel with a meeting room thing, and apparently I got the notion that it was through the fundraiser thing for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. And they were doing a thing there, and Mom and I snuck in and how she does sometimes, sent me to the front with somebody else. I climbed over a couple chairs and there were like four empty chairs in the front row and I took one of them. And this lady, this Barbara lady is talking and talking, and showing little movie things about their life and stuff, and then Celine Dion came out to talk to the people, and she was in a wheelchair, like one of those scooter motorized things. And before she addressed the people, apparently they were like taking a break or something, and she came up to the people in the front, and I said, ""I know you've heard this a thousand times, but I'm one of your biggest, most humongous fans."" And she leaned over and the took my one hand in both of hers, and her voice was like real soft and mystery, kind of like _________ is, and I couldn't figure why that was."
"C-210"	"#C-210 (2004-10-20 (19)) We're now in Cedar Park and it's taken this long before I've ever had a dream that I can remember because I have been just going and going and going all through the days, and when I sleep and when I wake up, it's like, ""Bleah...."" There's like nothing that I can remember. But today I can remember one. I dreamt that was going to Modern Media College, over for some kind of an introductory thing, and it was this real informal, casual meeting at this McDonald's cafeteria thing. And they had this yellow awning and stuff, and it was real colorful. And this one guy came over to me, kind of like a teenage student assistant type of thing, and he gave me this paper with some writing scribbled on it. And he said, ""This is a test. You need to pass this test if you want to get in. You need to turn it in, in Orientation tomorrow."" And he gave me two papers. One paper was like writing of questions, and another paper was a worksheet. And this writing was like in pencil. I could barely read it. And in my dream I was out at this open park place and it was almost dusk, and I had this CC TV set up at a picnic table. And I was reading this stuff and the sentences didn't make sense. You had to fill in the blank. One of the sentences that I can remember was, ""The mixer marked ________ before you can walk."" And I wrote, ""Queue up,"" for some reason. And I don't remember what the other things were, but they were just jumbled and they didn't make any sense. And I was real concerned that they weren't making sense to me. And then I woke up."
"C-211"	"#C-211 (2004-10-22 (19)) The first part I can remember the best is that Mom was going to have lunch with Lenny, and I was in Best Buy looking at some stuff, and I had my long book bag and it was dragging it around. And it had all kinds of stuff in it; it was real heavy. And sometimes I wonder if I look suspicious in stores before I have to look so closely and touch so many things. But in this dream a security guard from Best Buy started giving me a hard time and I said, ""Here, do you want to search through this bag? Go ahead."" And he said, ""Yes, I would like to search through this bag."" And he started pulling out all my books, my umbrella, my sweater, and I told him, ""There are some blank CD RW's in the bag, but they've been opened. They don't belong to the store. And there's also a MiniDisc recorder that has my ID on it."" And he's looking and looking through the bag, and then he packs everything back in just like I had it. He seemed satisfied. That was crazy, man. And then, the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were at this circus place with me, and there were these animals that would supposedly harm somebody, but they were so friendly and so gentle, this tiger -- actually there were two tigers and a bear. The next thing I knew, they were in our bed and we were just loving to have them. And Analisa, the little Jehovah's Witness girl, showed up in my dream and she said, she was sitting at the foot of our bed talking with us. And she said how having those animals in that bed was sort of like infidelity. And we were explaining to her that we just needed to give them a home and stuff. That is when I woke up."
"C-212"	"#C-212 (2005-01-29 (19)) The last three nights I've been having pretty dynamic dreams, but I just finished the whole blank tape and I have been reluctant to start another one. And mostly I've been writing them down in my journal, or rather typing them. But I feel like, for some reason or another, I need to go back to speaking on a tape. And I think that is because my writing -- I describe things differently when I write than when I speak. And for journal and for diary that's good because I like my word sense per se, my syntax. I like how I can sit and come up with vivid descriptions of things. But in my dreams some things are very vivid, and I can't describe them in words, and it's easier to describe them verbally than actually writing it down in words. Although sometimes it may be better to write them down in words because I capture more detail that way, like when I wrote about Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I singing on stage and jumping on this trampoline, I just filled that with as many details as I could think of. And I guess I have to try to do that in my ______. And I keep saying one of these days I want to sample all these things and I want to turn them into mp3's and I want to cram tons of them on a single CD so that I don't have all these tapes laying around, and so that I can start using the tapes again to do stuff like this, because every time a thought rips me, I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing or get up in the middle of the night and go turn in my machine and grab a mike and plug it into the mixer and go to c____ and get Pro and doot, do doot, do doot; doot, do doot, do doot. I want to grab my take machine, hit ""record"" and start saying what's on my mind or what I'm thinking before it just totally goes away. So it's better consistent, just voice, it doesn't really matter; it doesn't have that much spectrum to it. So I can use tapes to capture it and then sit around diddling, diddling and diddling and diddling after the fact. [laugh] So here we go. Last night's dream is still the clearest to me because it was the most recent and because it kind of hit my like a ton of bricks in the way. Not that heavy, but it was something that I was thinking about. I dreamt I was back home in Westport and it was like I had been away for a while, like I am, and I was coming home. And they were having a celebration for me, but it was a little pinky celebration. There was like three people there, I think Clark and Marilou and Terri. And they were just talking, there was no real party going on. But somehow Mom was riding the bike and I was sitting on her handlebars in the basket, and she was telling me that she was pregnant, and that she was having a baby. And she said that she didn't want to have to start all over again, but that Dad wanted another child, and he did want to start all over again. And so she had to have this baby because he wanted one. And she said, ""I'm only going to love this baby half as much as I love you."" And I was so sad for her because, first of all, she didn't want to start all over again. This is a time in her life where she's ready to move on and do other things, and apparently it wasn't like the regular pregnancy term. It was this deal where you get pregnant, and four or five days later [laugh] the baby pops out. That was messed up, man. And then we were on -- in the last scene of that dream -- we were on the bed, and I was laying and I was talking to Mom about various things. And she was signaling to me that Dad was on the other side of the bed and not to say anything really outlandish. And I looked over and I saw that he was, but in this dream that was unusual because she was on his side of the bed and he was on her side of the bed. Now his side of the bed is the closest to the short mirror dresser and the stereo receiver in the room, and her bed is closer to the upright dresser and the night stand and the air conditioner thing-a-ma-jiggy. So in my dream they were kind of reversed, and I was just kind of making up small talk. And then I woke up. Now the night before I had a dream that was real, real kind of foggy and bleah and blurry, and literally I was walking around in a blurry world. But the concept and what happened is kind of not clear either. I dreamt that we had come home from some kind of long trip and we needed to do something with Grandpa, and it was dark out. And Dad was in the truck and Mom was in the car, and I was riding with Mom in the car. And Dad was going to go to Home Depot and get one or two things for Grandpa and then go over to his house. And Mom said she was going to go do some grocery shopping and make some copies and this and that and the other, and she said, ""I hope you don't mind me driving around so much."" And Dad was like, ""No, that shows that you love me and you want to take care of things around the house, and for the house. And I was like, ""Wow,"" they would never say anything like that in real life. They've never been gushy over each other. And so Mom and I really were just going gallivanting, just going to do all this stuff together, and we were in this area that had woods. We stopped the car and for some reason we shut off the engine, but the headlights were still on. And she was guiding me through this banyan tree area, I think there were like several banyan trees. And there was this net, and she led me through, you know, tripping through the roots and everything, and there was a butterfly caught in the net, and it was a big butterfly, about the size of my two hands put together, if each hand was a wing. And it looked like a Monarch, and it touched it, and that helped it get out of the net and it flew off. But I felt good that I was actually able to see a butterfly. And that's all I can really remember about that dream. And the third one that was two nights ago or three nights ago, I dreamt that I was at some kind of beach with Mom and Dad and Terri and a bunch of other people, and we were planning this celebration for me for some reason. I think had either graduated or had some kind of successful milestone and we were going to be in a parade, and we were going to be in a school bus in a parade. And we were organizing like the parade route and this and that and the other, and the bus driver had this really thick Spanish accent. And this lady -- I don't know who she was -- I don't know who she was, but she was very outgoing, she sounded like a cross between Terri and Serena, and she was leading everybody and trying to get them to have fun and party on this bus. And you know how buses have intercom systems sometimes to talk to the passengers? Well, she was, her and another cluster of people were yelling into the mike, saying, ""Party, yahoo!"" and stuff like that. And I'm really surprised that there was no feedback, but in this dream that law of physics was suspended, and it was funny because she aimed it at me and I was sitting like four rows back. And she said, ""Jasmine, say something!"" And I don't remember what I said, but I said something and it was amplified as though I was talking into it. And that's all I can remember about that."
"C-213"	"#C-213 (2005-02-01 (19)) Modern Media College was having a seminar at the Eastport Airport about audio related to the travel industry, so to speak, and what goes into like setting up the PA on a plane, and what goes into like wiring one of those airports for sound and stuff. And I just thought that was going to be so interesting, but how I was going to get from here to Eastport Airport was beyond me. And actually in this dream I was back in Westport, and I actually had to do a triangle. I had to get back over to Modern Media College, then over to Eastport Airport. Somehow Mrs. Dougherty was involved, and I wanted Mom to go with me so I wanted her to chaperone this field trip. And, you know, things aren't organized like they used to be in high school, but I thought they were in this dream, and I thought we were going to have a really big bus that was going to just drive us, and Mom could sit on the bus and chaperone the trip, you know. But the only hitch here is that I couldn't find the papers that said what day that was going to be, and it was going to be on a Tuesday and in my dream I didn't know if that was going to be today or next week. And so I was afraid that I missed it. And actually when I was trying to tell Mom and Dad about this, Mom was drawing something, and Dad suggested putting serial numbers on the back of her painting so that if she did two or three of similar, then it would kind of add value to them. And I could tell it went over like a lead balloon with Mom. [laugh] But she said, ""Okay, that's a good idea."" And she was going upstairs to her room to look for the papers, and then I woke up."
"C-214"	"#C-214 (2005-02-06 (19)) I know I had kind of a complicated dream last night, but I can only dream a small little part of it because I went to sleep about 8:00, got up about 1:00, did my lab, went back to sleep about 5:30 and now it's 8:00 and I'm awake again in time for class at 9:00, except I'm a little made at myself because I forgot that I already took my clays and I don't have to be there until 10:30. I could have let myself sleep another hour. Oh well. The part of the dream that I can remember is that I was at some kind of apartment place or hotel that had a pool. I think it was supposed to mimic the place here, but I felt like it was a place that I didn't live at. The pool was an indoor pool with a little like greenhouse cover over it, but in order to turn the heat up in the water, what you had to do was go through a little gate, kneel down and crawl inside of a box that had all kinds of pumps and stuff in it. And you had to lay on your back and up on the roof of this box was a touch screen like the one on the keyboard in class. And what you had to do is you had to press a button and then touch a particular object on the menu, just like you do with that, and then it would come on. I was feeling really claustrophobic and I didn't know if I was going to be able to handle that. And even after I sort of did that, I came out and I looked at the pool, and I was going to go in. But I decided I wouldn't."
"C-215"	"#C-215 (2005-02-08 (19)) I was graduating from Modern Media College already and I had a friend that was graduating from the university close by, and for some reason we had to attend the preppy dinner for the preppy university, and Modern Media College really didn't have a real like distinct cap and gown like uniform things, and they had us wear like regular clothes, which I hear is what they're going to do. But I got this like get-up together that had like a black cap and a black gown from somewhere and I dressed it all up. I put all kinds of flowers on my cap, and I put all kinds of dangly, dingly things around my neck, and I went in a parade, a parade that the university was putting on, I think several universities in the area. I just paraded around and ____ the parade. And I dreamt that I had a column stand like ____ thing that I could put pens in somebody gave me as a present. And I was trying to get Mom and Merrilee to come, so they'd come by themselves, and that's about all I can remember. I don't know if they ever did."
"C-216"	"#C-216 (2005-02-10 (19)) I was taking a class at Modern Media College, actually I was taking a test in a class, and the instructor was pretty friendly, but the test was about a bunch of confusing data and numbers that I really didn't know about. And they were like at work stations, and each of us had a computer and a CC TV, believe it or not. And we really didn't need the computer for the test, and everybody was using their CC TV. And it was this like third of a sheet of paper that had like the answer things that you bubble in and then a full sheet of paper with the questions. And it was stuff about matching up numbers and letters and like, ""Mode E has 115 different things and Mode Z has 40 different things,"" and just stuff like that. And I think this is kind of a reflection of mini messages, but mini messages are a little more specific than that. This was just crazy stuff being thrown around. And so I did as best as I could, and some of it was even being explained to us as we were taking it, and I remember leaving the work station and going to the middle of the room and sitting down at a big roll-top desk and writing, like for some reason. I don't know what I was writing. Then I would go back and do some more of the test. And somehow that jumped to another little scene when I was done with the test. I didn't know if I was getting married or graduating or if I was just having a birthday, but I was getting these presents in my mailbox, like one person gave me a talking teddy bear with a heart. Another person gave me a little stuffed peacock that you like clip onto something. And about that time I woke up."
"C-217"	"#C-217 (2005-02-12 (19)) Dad and Mom and I were in a hotel for some reason, and we were on some kind of business trip that they had to take care of business, and I can't remember what. But I remember Mom was taking me to an airport and she was showing me how to get around in the airport. And she was gearing me up so that one day I could fly by myself, and in my dream they were like out on the tarmac, like out where the people never go. And I could hear the planes revving up and going around and stuff, and it made me really, really sad, I think because we couldn't go to Jackson this year or something. I always associate lots of fun awaiting me and her, and we fly away from Westport and we go to Jackson and we have a vacation. And I've always loved flying just because I've done it since I was a tiny baby. And the next little scene was that we were home from the hotel and for some reason or another I left my cell phone in the hotel room. Well, first of all, we had this garbage and laundry that we had to deal with, and I guess Dad wanted us to all do it in a very orderly kind of a way. I basically said, ""Well, if you and I are going to do it, I'll do whatever you want, but if he's going to be out there, I'm not doing any of it."" And before that little scene, I remember I saw a groundhog. It looked like a miniature squirrel with no tail, and I was studying it and it was coming out of a little hole, like they do. And I dropped in a little piece of my hair to see what it would do, and it nibbled at it a little bit and then kind of spit it out. [laugh] And I watched it come out of the hole and walk on all fours and go up this hill, and I was looking at it from there with my distance aid. I could get pictures with my distance aid as if it were a camera, and I took three pictures of it. I think while I was looking at the groundhog, I was hearing somebody playing major chords somewhere, but I don't know how or why. It was just sound that was there in my dream. And the last little scene before I woke up is that I was at this CC TV and it was over in the dining room and I was back in Westport, and I had tons of academic work to do, like I had a book report to do in Spanish. And I was looking over the vocabulary list that comes with it and I had all of this other like essays and stuff to do. And I remember feeling confident that I was just going to plough on through it because I was doing it myself. Maybe that came from the fact that I saw Spanish cleaning ladies at Modern Media College and I talked with them, and it made me think about all the vocabulary and stuff that I haven't thought about in a while, which is good, I guess."
"C-218"	"#C-218 (2005-02-13 (19)) For some reason _____________ ________ show, and somehow _______Mrs. Dougherty really well, and through her mother got to help do some of the fashions and I got to help do some of the sound work. And so I dreamt that I was like sitting in our garage at Westport with Celine and she has her short hair, and she has this like thing that's kind of like a guitar amp, but it could amplify any signal, in this case either her voice or somebody else's. And it had most of her reverb settings and program that she has to go through, kind of like the ones in school and how I have such trouble with them because they have everything that you need to know in this display that I can barely read. So ____ program 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- well, she was 4 or 5 and was getting these weird swirly kind of chorus effects, and she said, ""How can I get none of this? How can I get back to having nothing?"" And I suggested going back to program #1 and that works. And she has this other little thing with tons of reverb in it too, and we really couldn't turn it off. [laugh] That was strange. And the next scene we were at Westport High School and I think Mom was ______ or something and she was laying on the couch. And I was getting ready for class and I was in Mrs. Dougherty's class again, and we were ____________ and stuff, and this time I was one of the misbehaving and acting up ones for some reason because Mom was there and every time I thought of something, I wanted to tell her something. And [sigh] I don't remember too much more of how that unfolded. But one of the crazy parts was that there were these little figurines that she passed out of like Celine in different costumes because we were analyzing how the costumes made the mood of the show change. And I said to Mom, ""If there's any extra figures laying around that people like throw on the floor or something, pick them up for me."" You know, they were like leprechauns that you put in cupcakes, and I had one of her in the red. And then I woke up. That was crazy, but I think it has something to do with getting into the production side of things now and how things that become big don't really appear big to the team that's putting them on. And even if they are big, they don't treat everything as though it's going to be big. They go and they do their thing among themselves. "
"C-219"	"#C-219 (2005-02-16 (19)) First of I dreamt that Aunt Janice was here with me, visiting me, and we had been to an audio production seminar together. She was interested in it, I guess, because she could use it to help her business put presentations and stuff together. And I was trying to teach her about wave form editing. She didn't really get it at the seminar, so I offered to have her come back here and I was going to teach her some about it. I had this program that kind of worked like Cool Edit Pro, but it looked like Digital Performer. There was a white background, black glaze, and in some cases the waves really looked like audio waves, but in other cases they were just g___ of a sign wave, like up and down and up and down like in the form of a sign wave. And I couldn't figure out why that was, but somehow it was working for us. About that time somebody knocked on my room door and said that ______ was kind of upset, and she, I went out there and she was holding two dishes in her hands and sitting on the couch and crying. And she said, ""These were in the fridge, and I have to wash them every time."" And I felt bad for her and so I took them from her and they were full of gooey mushroom soup, by the way, and I said, ""Don't worry; I'll wash them tomorrow. It's okay."" I got real close to her like I do with Mom and I kissed her. And she kind of wiped her tears away and everything, and then I went back to editing sound with Aunt Janice, and she was looking around my room while I was doing all that, and I had these weirdo little things around. And I had this tall, skinny extra, extra-exaggerated statue of Pluto that she was looking at, and I had this blue cow statue with a yellow bow on its collar. Actually it wasn't a statue; it was a cut-out out of felt. And she said, ""Oh, you have the blue cow. I love blue cows."" [laugh] And she wanted me to record her talking about the cow statue into my editing program so that we could learn about editing using that audio. And that's about all I can remember."
"C-220"	"#C-220 (2005-02-20 (19)) I had a crazy dream last night, that I was back in Westport and that I was having classes at Westport College just for the month that I was in town, just so that I could have something to do. I really didn't want to go to them. I had a class that started at 5:00 and ended at 9:00, just like I do at Modern Media College. But it was about history or something. And I was explaining about how Mom and Dad were going off and that they were going to be doing some errands so they could bring me there, but that I was going to have a cab bring me home. And while I was there, I was staying at this like commons dorm-like type thing instead of at the house, and I had my own room with a bed like I do here, and I had to go to another place to take a shower. And I took my shower, well, before I took my shower, I was on the couch with two girls and a boy. They had this thing that belonged to one of the girls, and this is whacko. What it was, was like something that sort of looked like the two mikes that we were talking about in class, but it was more like this kind of hypnotist therapy thing where you hypnotize people with it. And what it did is that it sends out a certain electrical field, sort of you hold it and you swirl it around someone's head so that the electrical field sort of whirls around their head and relaxes and hypnotizes them and whatever. And it would also create the sound of certain musical notes as you hold it close or further away from somebody's head, kind of like a Theremin. You could change the strength of the electrical field. They were all teasing around like teenagers do. This boy decides he's going to try it on me. It's okay at first, but then he's holding it a little too close to my head and it's not good, so I'm trying to take his hand and make him back it away. In doing that, I bumped the switch to change the electrical field, and then it was really strong and making all these arching sounds, and I couldn't stand it. And I think I finally got away from him and got into the shower place and got my shower. And when I was done there, I had to get back to my dorm room and I was totally naked. And in this place it was okay to run totally naked from the shower to your dorm room, but I couldn't find my dorm room. All these little hallways and things that I would run down, and I would open the door and it would be somebody else's room with somebody else's stuff, and I would go to another place that I thought was mine, and there were two boys watching TV. And I closed the door and they didn't say anything like about they saw me or anything, but I woke up without ever finding my room, I guess."
"C-221"	"#C-221 (2005-02-21 (19)) There were people that lived in our complex that were having a wedding, and they invited Jill and I. In my dream we were close to water, and at these peoples' place they had this house and they had this pool and then in the back they had a boat, but it was more like a big, big ship. This place was close enough that I could walk from my apartment. And so Jill and I walked over and once we got there, we kind of like parted ways, like we wouldn't be together. And I walked around and I looked at things. I walked around the pool and I was careful not to fall in because it was actually kind of cold, but I went in these scruffy-looking shorts and this pink sweater with gold sleeves. It was still kind of tame; people were getting ready, but the bride hadn't changed yet. She was still in like beach clothes, and I didn't even know who she was. I didn't know why anybody was. And, but they were real warm and friendly. They seemed to know me real well. I think a girl and her father and the son were kind of milling around. Nobody had already changed yet. They did a little bit of stuff and I was thinking how, man, it would have been so nice if I could have the Peavey system and DJ for them. I was thinking how I couldn't have gotten it from Westport to here and here to there in an hour, so that was kind of a lost cause. After a while, when everybody went to change, I went back to my apartment to change into shorts, and I didn't know what happened to Jill. She must have went off with some other people or something. And I put long pants on and kept my pink sweater with the gold sleeves. [laugh] At that time I think they were like starting to serve some food and I got a little bit, and then they were going to take everybody on the ship for the actual party. They didn't actually do any exchanging of vows or anything. They just had like a reception party, and everybody was changed into their clothes and everybody was all authentic and everything, and we were on this big ship. It reminded me of the Prince Eric ship. And I went out on -- it wasn't tall like the Titanic, but it sure was long -- and I went out on the deck and I sat out there to look out on the water. In my dream I feel asleep, and I fell asleep while all the partying was going on. Whoever was captaining the ship came to get me to say that he had come back to dock and that it was time to go back to the house. And he was real nice and, you know, when I step on and off of a boat, I have to take somebody's hand, and he gave me both hands like I need and he kind of helped me get on dry land. And then when I went into the house, Mom was there, and she was helping them pick up the food and clean up everything, and I didn't get to have any wedding cake because I was asleep, and so she gave me some. And there was this milk bottle thing that I felt was going to have milk in it and so I poured some in a cup and I was going to have cake and milk, but instead what it was, was some kind of cleaning stuff and I took a sip and I was like, ""Bleah!"" and it was a good thing I didn't swallow. .... Hey, that was perfect timing. Did you hear how that tape didn't flip until I was done? I've never had good timing like that before. Let me just sure things happened when they were supposed to.... And the night before I had a dream that I didn't get a chance to put on the tape, that I will now. Kind of goofy. I dreamt that I was still in the middle of my program at Modern Media College, but it was Christmas again already. Mom and Dad and Sandra, and I think Samantha and Derek, were coming to visit me. And my room was a little bigger than it actually was, and I had wooden floors in this place, and it was kind of dark. And I had the two _____ was plugged in, and I had the angels and swan thing on my dresser, like I do. We were all sitting around in here. There weren't enough chairs so everybody was on the floor in the space in front of my bed, over by the computer table and the dresser, the big open area. We were all sitting around in a circle in that area. We were talking about how we were going to go from my place to Westport in a whole like caravan train [laugh] and Mom and Dad were doing to drive their car and Samantha and Derek were going to go in theirs and Sandra was going to go in hers, and we were going to just do a caravan train. And we were bringing a bunch of furniture and stuff with us, as though I were going to move back. Mom had brought me the cheap TV trays like she told me she was going to, but when we went back to Westport, she brought them back. And in my dream we were going to bring all my Christmas decorations and things, for what reason I don't know. And without my really knowing, Mom packed my keyboard in the stuff to go home. When we got home, she set it up on the kitchen table, with the tablecloth folded back, and she wanted me to play her a song while she was wrapping Christmas presents. And I kind of kept procrastinating and dawdling a little because I knew that everybody was outside and they were going to come in the back door and they were going to start parading through the kitchen any minute. And so, sure enough, they did and I told Mom, ""Come one, we've got to flip the tablecloth down."" And so she flipped the tablecloth down and nobody saw anything and they paraded through the kitchen. In my dream they didn't even have a Christmas tree up yet because something funny happened and she didn't get to put it up. So I don't remember, I think we were going to do something like that. And that was really all I can remember."
"C-222"	"#C-222 (2005-02-27 (19)) First of all I dreamt that I was in this classroom at Modern Media College that had desks in it, but everybody like moved to the front of the room and was listening to a lecture about something, I don't remember quite what. But I kind of, somebody told me that this was normally a Pro Tools lab, but it was going to be a lecture room for today. And we were having a lecture about Midi (?) and they were going to play us this sequence and solo out different parts, and have us listen to the way the different parts combine, and they did some of that. And -- oh, next thing I know, all of these people are at our house in Westport and we're, the instructor is there and everybody is there, and we're trying to build this same sequence and they have like a synthesizer, I guess. For this part when we were in our living room, it was this big stocky synth in the middle of our rug and everybody was all crowded around. And next when Mom and Dad walked in [part unhearable] and there was like a bunch of stuff, and they just basically did some cleaning up and all because all of us are really into what we're doing. Oh, and the next part is really good. I dreamt that it was time for me to be in lab, and so I was in lab. And Mom was there with me so that when I need to find something on the screen and I didn't know where it was, she would point it out to me. And when I work on the computer and Mom is there, I'm really lazy because there's something that I want to find, like a document or something and I open the folder and I say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it so I don't have to, because I could find it myself, but I just say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it and we go from there. So I dreamt that she was there doing that for me in lab, and it was really crazy because we had to go to the start menu and select various views or sections for various examples, and I was having a hard time selecting the right one. And each one had like something different on the desktop and then when I opened up the sequence program, she would help me find certain little things that I needed to find. I don't remember what program we were using, but I just remember being glad that she was there. And then after a while she went to sit in the back of the room, and chat away with the instructor just like she used to do when I was in middle school or high school sometimes. And then I woke up."
"C-223"	"#C-223 (2005-03-01 (19)) Man, I screwed myself over. What I did is instead of turning on Alarm #1 that is set for 7:14 so that I can wake up in time to do my thing and wake up and eat my breakfast and get dressed before lab at 9:00 -- our class, I mean, at 9:00 -- I turned on Alarm #2 which is set for 5:17, and it just came on and woke me up and now I'm wide awake and it's 5:30 in the morning, and I don't know if I'm going to go back to sleep or I'm just going to stay up, but now I'm all wired for sound because I'm starting to have thoughts go through my mind about all kinds of stuff, and I'm very bad about just turning my brain off. [laugh] Because my brain is always thinking. Okay, so now that I'm awake at this hour and this goofy dream is fresh in my mind, I'm going to put it on the tape. I dreamt that I had to give Christina a flower arrangement. I guess it was for her graduation or her birthday or something. I didn't really want to because she was being a conceited snob to me. Now Christina usually is okay to us, but I hear that she can be quite a snob, so I guess that's what this is based on. And it was just like three roses and some other flowers, so went over to, it turns out that it's not Christina, it's Jill. And Jill had a thought that she wanted me to hold the g_____ while she taped, and I did that and she thanked me and she was surprised. And, let's see what I remember. Oh, we were sitting in the living room, Mom and I, and we were eating this crazy pudding-like type dessert with Cheerios thrown in it. And Mom said that that was something that Melinda used to do. And I dreamt that that evening Melinda had invited us to go to her house, and Mom and I were going to kind of sneak out the back door and walk over there. [laugh] I don't think we ever made it over there, but she was saying how she was going to give us root beer floats and stuff. And the last scene is that I was on a playground at a school, I think, and there was a boy about 10 or 11 and he wanted me to tell him the difference between a May (?) controller and an arranger model. And about that time I woke up."
"C-224"	"#C-224 (2005-03-03 (19)) I have got a 1:00 am MIDI lab tomorrow morning and I am supposed to be getting in the lab and going to sleep, and I think I'm heading in that direction. I didn't do any practicing tonight because I didn't want to get myself all keyed up (ha ha ha!) [laugh] , but for some reason I'm all keyed up anyway. I did something boring. I read my Media and Society book with my eyes, not with App Reader on the CD Rom, so that I'd get really tired and really bored and I'd start going to sleep like I'm supposed to. But I don't know, stuff just started getting back into my head, and I started getting all excited, like I did. [laugh] I remember the goosey dream that I had last night. I dreamt that it was Christmas time again, of all things, and Mom and Dad were coming to visit me and I got a week off for Christmas in this dream. And they were going to bring me home, and I was in Sound Foundation class, and Erik, the _____ chorus director/ instructor decides that he's not going to give us a week off for Christmas. He decides he's going to extend our classes -- the Monday-Wednesday and Friday into the Christmas break week just because he thinks that we're like students that need like, we need to be punished for some reason. And that's what he did. And so in my dream I had to work out logistics of going to class, dealing with having a visit for Christmas and all, and in this one scenario I actually thought that I was going to leave class and walk to my apartment, which I do, but keep going until I got to Westport And then I was just going to meet everybody at home on the weekend. But then something changed and they were going to come to my apartment and pick me up. And so the scenario, the little scene that I remember the best is that I had a picnic lunch and I was sitting down on the curb in the parking lot and I was eating it. And I packed it all away, I took my shoes off and put them in my book bag, and it had just rained, so I was going to walk home barefoot and slop and splash in the all puddles like I still like to do. I hate getting my feet wet if I'm wearing any kind of shoes, but if I'm barefoot, I love to slop and splash in puddles. And as I was going through the first puddle, I woke up."

I dreamt it was my birthday, which my birthday isn't too far away, so that's not surprising. And I dreamt that Mom and Dad went somewhere, and I was back at Westport in their house, and I had been on a walk with them and I came home early, and the neighbors stopped them or something and were talking to them. And I thought there were some birthday presents on the kitchen table, so for some reason or another, I climbed up on the kitchen stool over by the refrigerator and it turned into this like tall ladder. And there was this rafter beam that went the length of the kitchen, that really isn't there, but it was there in my dream. And I got on my hands and my knees and I crawled across that rafter beam, and then I kind of swung myself down off of it and put my feet on one of the kitchen chairs, because I thought if I would just walk, then I would leave footprints and then they would know I'd been over there. And it turned out there weren't any presents on the table. It was just a vase of flowers. And I didn't seem to mind that there weren't any presents though. I was just curious to know if there were any. Then I went upstairs and I was looking around for my MiniDisc recorder, because I had a feeling they were planning a party, and I couldn't find it. I had a feeling Mom like unpacked my bags and put all my stuff all over the stuff like hide and seek. And so then I started looking for this tape machine as an alternative, and I couldn't find it either, and I knew I had brought both of them when I came. Then all of a sudden there were these people downstairs, a bunch of our neighbors and friends that were all coming over and they were ready for a party, and we were going to have a birthday party with them. And it was a surprise party that they sort of sprung. And I looked really ______ around the house for either my MiniDisc recorder or my tape machine because I couldn't let this event go by. And I couldn't find them, and then like three minutes went by, and I decided, okay, I'd better give it up and go down and join the party and just let my memory do the recording. So I went down and by that time there were only like two people left. It's like everybody came, they shuffled through, they whooped and whooped and partied it up, and like three minutes later they were gone. And by the time I got downstairs there was no party; I had missed the party. And it was just Dad and these two people. And pretty soon the two people left too and it was just Mom and Dad and me. And for some reason I was sitting on the floor near the receiver in the living room and the CD player over there, and they were on, but there was nothing coming out of them. Dad was giving one of his long spiels about something again. I think it was about, hmmm, I can't even remember what it was about, but it was about something stupid, I think. And I was thinking how I really would want to be at a birthday party instead of sitting there listening to all that. And then I woke up."
"C-226"	"#C-226 (2005-03-19 (19)) I can only remember bits and pieces of it, though. I woke up in the middle of the night and kind of laid for a while, so some of it got lost. But I remember first that I dreamt that I was here and that Jill's parents were coming to take care of a signature she needed on a check or something. And she was vacuuming my room with a little dust buster thing that made kind of a high squeaky kind of sound, and when they walked in, everybody said, ""Hi."" And I said, ""Hi"" back. And she said, ""I know Jasmine will enjoy having you."" If they really were coming, I would have enjoyed having them. And before that, I think I was back in Westport and I was standing on the back hallway, I actually was in the kitchen looking out at the back hallway and there was a kitchen standing in the back hall, looking in at us. I remember saying something like, I don't remember, I think we were going to go somewhere and do something, I don't know. After that we were in this fancy restaurant with a family that we knew. I think it was Melinda's family. It was Mom and Dad and I and Melinda, and we were eating this fancy food. I had this little stuffed dog that I was thinking of buying from the restaurant, and it was $90. And then I decided, that is ridiculous. I am leaving that darned thing. Before all that I have a vague memory that I dreamt that I was in this, in the area, in the balcony area that overlooked like this big open space. I was up there with a few other people and Alex was setting up this live rig and he was going to give a demonstration to people that gathered down in the open space. I think I was standing around in the way watching. He had a mixer and a big, heavy PA system, and that's about all I can remember."
"C-227"	"#C-227 (2005-03-20 (19)) The night before last I also had kind of an interesting dream, that was kind of boring, I guess, but not really. I dreamt that Mom actually did come up here Sunday before my birthday, and the first little scene was we were kind of in my neighborhood here, I guess, somewhere where there's a big open field. There really isn't any, but I _______. That's funny. I don't know why I said that, but we were in my neighborhood here and there was a big open field and we were running in it, and we were kind of running and chasing each other, kind of like what we did in the park one day. And she was planning this surprise for me, and it turns out that her and Dad were taking me to this place where you could experience virtual reality, and it's like the big high whoo-whoo, or it's supposed to be anyway. And I got there and all it is, all the hype that it is, is that you sit down in a chair with an orange light and it kind of skates around the room a little and there's these sounds that play. And like about after ten minutes of that, everybody was like, ""Wowowowow."" I don't know. And then in the next little scene it's like totally out of context, but I was in that same place, but it looked like the MIDI lab at Modern Media College with fluorescent lights blasting on everybody, because in the MIDI lab they keep really dim lighting so that if you need to see your monitor ___________ and stuff. But in here the fluorescent lights were bright, and nobody had moved the monitor for me or anything, but I still had to do my assignment. And there was this man, this really prissy man in a tuxedo, sitting next to me with a tie, and I had to tell him everything that I wanted to do, and how I wanted to do it. And he would interface with the machine and do it for me. And on the one hand, that was a way I could work, but on the other hand, it pretty much took all the creativity out of it because you were working through a medium pretty much. I mean I guess here is that [sigh] , I don't know, it's just not good when you've got to work through somebody else. And then Dad showed up and we went to this theme park, and I think it was Disneyland, but in my dream theme parks we don't really do that much. I think that I was on a roller coaster or something. And that's about all I can remember."
"C-228"	"#C-228 (2005-03-21 (19)) I don't know why I'm getting like this, but this morning when my alarm came on, I jumped up and I was kind of afraid that, I got real nervous because I thought I missed the lab. And it took me a minute to remember and sort out the confusion that Sunday night I got to sleep all night and this is Monday morning, and that Monday night was going to be my next lab. And I had to remember that Saturday night was my last one. I hope I don't do that next month if my labs are during the day. That's going to be crazy. But anyway, I had a dream last night that I had a class on the second floor of Modern Media College's building, which in Building 1 there aren't that many classrooms on the second floor. There's mainly administrative offices up there. But in my dream there was like classroom after classroom just like there is in a public school. And so I had a class up there and we were doing some kind of droop (?) work and all of a sudden we had a fire drill and it sounded like a high, shrill 1000 cicadas kind of alarm that you hear at the Media Center at Westport High School. And so there was this fire escape like type thing that was this metal stairway thing that led out the back way that we could go down. And it was so loud back there! I think I might have covered my ears, and it was still so loud, but not only was the alarm loud, there was some kind of water sprayer going on out there that was really loud. And then all of a sudden it all stopped, but there was like water at the bottom of the stairwell that would beep, and you had to swim across it to go to the little field area where you were supposed to stand. And I didn't really have a problem swimming; it was that the water smells and I didn't want to swim in the smelly water and get it all over me. So I got down in it and I went a little ways, and then I turned around because I decided that I didn't want to, and I was going to go back up the stairs and wait for people on the stairwell. All of a sudden all of these thorns started showing up on the railings and some even on the steps, so I figured, okay, I guess I'm, I waffled for a little bit, and I think I finally went over to this place where people stand. And then the whole class was gone. There was just one or two girls over there, and they were talking about how they made a pregnant Barbie or something, but they had to make a rap song along with it that proved its father was there somewhere. And they made a DVD about it too. [laugh] And that's when I woke up."
"C-229"	"#C-229 (2005-03-23 (19)) It's a very rainy morning. It's one of the worst weather days I've seen since I've been here. But it's summer time and we all know what happens in the summer time, so I should starting expecting it, I guess. Last night I had a dream that I was back in Westport and it was Easter time, but for some reason it was real cold outside, as though it were winter, and we had to put on jackets before we went outside. And I think either Mom or Dad -- no, it was some guy that was our neighbor -- wanted to take our pictures out there while I was home, and so we had to bundle all up and go out there. There was a swing out there that was built like Grammy's, where there weren't chains hanging from a tree; they were just hanging from a little, teensy metal thing at your head level. And, you know, they had gardens and flowers and stuff, and eggs hidden in various places, and I don't understand why it was so cold, but the scenery looked like spring. And we had a baby chick running around, a bunny running around, you know, like we used to have rabbits galore, except this rabbit was crazy. It was a live, running around rabbit, but you would pet it, like you would pet its head and it would say something. Or you would pet its back and it would say something. And I had the notion that they genetically engineered it like that, and I kind of thought that was so wrong. I thought rabbits are supposed to be rabbits in their own little right, their own little creature, and their body language should convey what they mean. And we shouldn't go messing with them like that. But that was like off the wall, man! And I know there was so more to this dream; let me think a minute. The only other thing I can remember is that I think Sandra showed up somewhere in this, and I had like a big, flat briefcase full of my school papers that I was showing to this neighbor. One other thing that I should note here: the rabbit that was whacko was a white one, and it was the size and weight and everything of just a regular bunny running around, that you get at the pet store. And the baby chick was yellow. I don't know if that means anything, but I've heard that colors are very significant, so I thought that I would include that."
"C-230"	"#C-230 (2005-03-26 (20)) I was back in the Media Lab at Modern Media College and I was taking my test out, just like I did the day before, except there was this man there that was like a cross between Stuart and Alec. He was like the course director who was giving the lab test, instead of the lab guys. And what we had to do for test, instead of being able to navigate through the software and know what to do to make what goes ding-a-ling or whatever, we had to actually, we had to play competently into the sequencer and make a coherent musical sequence and know what notes were and stuff. And if you couldn't do that, then our test was like ""pffffffff."" And around -- this room was like really big, there were like forty lab stations in it, and it looked different than the one that we have. Instead of being kind of angled back like ours is, this one was straight up, like everything was pretty much straight on top of each other, and the monitor was like, the base of it was at my forehead level. And so I sat down and I started doing what I could do, and I couldn't get any notes to come out of the thing. It was like it was some kind of synthesizer was on this patch that had like crazy sound effect noises like police sirens and frizzy ""aaaaash"" sounds and trash cans opening and dumb things like that. And around me taking the test were little kids, like 5 and 6-year-olds and they knew what they were doing right away and everything. And they seemed to really enjoy it. And I think there was something else in this dream that touched a chord with me, but I don't remember what it was now. That's kind of a bummer."
"C-231"	"#C-231 (2005-03-29 (20)) Something's screwy with this tape. I just got halfway through my whole spiel here and realized that this tape isn't even going. It stopped and it got held up on the ______ wagon, you know that rap song where they go, ""Hold up."" Well, that's what this is. Well, now I see that it's going again, so now I can start blabbing away again. Well, I guess this is take 2. It's my birthday. I'm going to party like it's my birthday. I really can't party like it's my birthday, but I wish I could. But I had an interesting dream last night that I still can remember a lot of the details. And so I figure I may as well just break open a new tape and start recording it. I dreamt that I was having classes back at Westport High School, but two of them were my Modern Media College classes and two were just ""blah"" General Ed classes. I think I dreamt that I had Audiotronics, Media and Signing, Spanish and PE, and I had Spanish with Mrs. Hanover, and I was there my first day and I had Spanish first period. And let's see. I was doing some kind of book work for her. I think I was doing like a test or something that was like four pages long, and I only got through the first page and a half of it, and the other people had to turn it in right away and she was real serious about it, but she said I could come in later and finish it. And when I left there, went to another class, I can't remember what it was, but I didn't have my printed schedule yet because the system was so screwed up and they weren't ready to give them out. So I had these other two classes that I kept missing because I didn't know what time they were being held and what time I was supposed to be there. So I thought I was going to call the school and say, ""Hey, look, what's going on with this? I have two classes but I keep missing them."" And then I realized that I lost my book bag and my purse and I was walking around and walking around campus. And the way the campus looked is that it had one building that looked a lot like a house because it had bedrooms up top and like a student lounge thing that I wandered into, and it had a TV and a pool table and a couch and things. But at the student lounge area I didn't notice right away, but there was this steep ramp down and I slid and tripped and ended up falling flat on my face. And I got up and sort of climbed my way back up. And then I went up the stairs and went into this bedroom, and there was nobody in there. I kept walking around and around these halls asking people if they'd seen my book bag, and then I went home and I realized that my book bag and my purse were both under the gardenia bush by our back window, our back door. So then I laid a towel down in the yard and I called Westport High School with my cell phone and I talked to Mrs. Lipp, and I was saying, ""I've got these other two classes that I keep missing because I don't have my schedule yet. Can you please tell me what time they're going to meet?"" And I woke up before she could tell me. That was crazy."
"C-232"	"#C-232 (2005-04-04 (20)) I was at the park with Mom and Dad in Westport and I was coloring these dinosaurs. And I was mainly coloring a stegosaurus and I was going to make the body green and the spikes yellow. And I had the notion that it was going to be a design for a robot dinosaur and it was going to be mechanical. And I was also trying to do math problems. They were simple addition and subtraction problems that were six digits, four whole numbers and then two decimal places. And Mom said I should do these math problems so that I would be able to balance my checkbook better. And I kept doing mistakes, like I couldn't do my subtraction really well on the first one, and on the second one I subtracted the cents and added the dollars. [laugh] I don't think I've done that in a while actually. Then the next thing I was riding in a truck with Dad, and he was going to drop me off in another part of the park, a part where I could walk home from. And he was playing a tape. The truck radio in real life has a tape deck in it, but the tape deck has never ever, ever, ever been used. And I don't even dare put a tape in it because I'm afraid it'll eat it as those things do. Well, in my dream Dad was playing a tape in the truck and it was this instructional story tape of how to put digital robot dinosaur together that I was trying to do. And it had some really soft and sweet music on it, and it was really an interesting thing to listen to. And it sort of just had that soft sound appeal that I like. He dropped me off and I had my portable tape player. Actually it was a big heavy one from APH in the talking book library, and he gave me the tape out of the front of the unit, and he said, ""No, here, wait a minute. Let me rewind it."" So I sat there with the door open for a minute while he rewinded it, I mean he rewound it -- what am I saying? I'm tired, can you tell? Then I got out and I started walking towards the tree where I was going to sit down and listen to the tape, and then I realized that this tape player that I had needed batteries and I didn't have any. And then I woke up."
"C-233"	"#C-233 (2005-04-05 (20)) It's evening time again. I don't know why I wait until evening to do these lately, I guess because I was pretty ""bleah"" this morning and I had a lot of stuff on my mind, and I guess I just didn't remember the dream very much this morning. And as I went on through the day, subtle things kept popping back to me -- things that I saw, things that heard -- and by the end of the day I put it together as a puzzle and only certain parts, though, are kind of clear. And so I'll tell what I remember. I dreamt that, well, first of all, there's several little things that are coming together here. This dream takes place in the area that is the shopping zoo that I cross every day to go to Modern Media College, basically the whole area between the AT&T place and the Dollar Store. But in my dream around the U, instead of being stores, there were classrooms, and these classrooms were where we were going to have some of our classes. And the doors were white with clear glass panes up at like the chest level, and the arch just like all the doors that Westport High School had, you know, like my Spanish classroom and the door to the Little Theater and the door to this and the door to that. They were all like that. Well, that's how these doors were. And I had the notion that the material that was going to be taught in these classes was Modern Media College's material, but they were treating us like we were elementary school students, like, for example, when we went to lunch we had to walk in a straight line to go to the cafeteria. But other than that, they pretty much treated us like adults. There was this Spanish lady and this man and they were like team teaching, you know how in lab there are several people and they are all kind of teaching at once. And this class was going to be kind of like Song Craft, but instead of just knowing what the song was about and analyzing it, you had to actually perform something original. You could either stand up in front of the class and sing, or you could beat on the board or you could kind of clap your hands or something, but you had to go up there and do something. And so I was pretty kind of interested because there were these four boys, one of them had like a little, like a tiny like kids' toy drum set. I think one of them was going to play a trombone or something and three of them each had keyboards. And I think there was another one that was going to sing. And these people, I guess they were going to take their turn going up there and plugging into the sound system and getting everybody's attention or something. And they sent me to go and get something from across the U, and so they took their time fiddling around and I think they needed to wait for somebody to unlock the door, so I got on this chair that you roll around in, like a chair that you find in labs that you just roll around the room in, except this chair was orange. And I rolled this chair all the way across the U over to the other side, and I just sat there. And I sat there and I sat there and I sat there, and I didn't even remember what I had to go and get. And then I looked at the time and I was like, ""Oh, my gosh!"" and I had to zoom back. So I rolled my little orange chair across that parking as fast as I could to get to the other side of the U. And it turned out that everybody had already performed and I had totally missed all the performances because I dawdled too long. And all the guys with their instruments were walking out of the room. And I think I have to make a note here that the toy drum set was orange, and the three guys who had keyboard cases were orange too. Their cases were orange. And I was thinking, ""Oh, man, that's just a bummer. I wish I could have heard these guys."" And then I sort of faded into consciousness, gradually, as I was still seeing orange things. And then I realized it wasn't such a bummer because it was all just a stupid dream."
"C-234"	"#C-234 (2005-04-09 (20)) First I dreamt that Mom and I were riding around these antsy parking lots on the bike and she went to Public to do some shopping, and she took some of Public's cards and was going to hand them out at the fruit stand. And Publics gave her three Easter baskets because of that. One was kind of a normal one, one was small, kind of like, and the other one was really small. And in the really small one there was a ducky and these four or five little clips that you clip bags together closed with, but she called them short-its, and when I thought these short-it things were, were things that you strip away some of the wire and you put this clip there, so that when somebody steps on it, it shorts out the circuit and goes, ""Ahhhhhhhhh!"" That's funny. And so we rode the bike home, happy because we had all these Easter baskets and all these presents we were going to send people. And we got home and the front door was wide open, and now we're talking about back in Westport and that's like a major crime there. And the chicken was around pecking at some bread that was really, really moldy, and there was a bunch of garbage laying around the yard. And Dad was so sad about the fact that there was so much garbage around the yard and the chicken had moldy bread, and that the house hadn't been swept in a week. And he was just so like in a blue funk, like he gets, except he was so down that he was questioning the quality of his life. And I said something to him, I think, and he just came back with some stupid comment, which he has been known to do that after Mom and Dad had had a falling out and I say something about going on and doing something else, he'll come back with some really stupid comment sometimes. [laugh] But anyway, in this dream I just went on about my business and I was sitting in the porch swing kind of talking to the bird, I guess, and then he came by and said, ""You know, I think I know what would really make me happy. I would like to take a VCR to the park and watch an instructional video about adjusting brake alignment."" And he said that there was something in an engine called the equalizer adjustment. And I had the notion that it didn't have to do with sound, but it had to do with the equalizing of how the parts lined up. But I thought it was strange that there was something termed like that in an engine, and so what would make him happy was to take a VCR to the park and watch a video about calibrating an engine basically. And so, now in real life, I don't think that would do the trick. I'll take a moment to tell a story here. In real life, when we were coming home from Janna's wedding, that trip was the most awful trip I can remember in my life, and Dad was laying in the back seat and Mom was driving, and I was sitting up front with her. And when we stopped at a rest stop to eat some picnic, he turned his back and wouldn't even touch any of the food or water that we were putting out, and when somebody came over to ask him about the car, he was like, ""Yeah, thanks."" And usually he's all excited and wanting to show them what's what, and wanting to ask them about the one they used to have. But this time he was like, ""Yeah, thank you."" So back to this dream. I think I said everything, and I think the reason why I'm thinking about, oh, I think the reason why I'm thinking about the word ""equalizer"" as being a part of an engine is because we had analog tape cal (?) lab last night, and it took me a while to understand that the tape EQ pot thing was really just an up or down boost for 10k only, and when you feed 10k through from the mil, you got to tweak the 10k thing so it'll be even all around, you know what I mean? That's all."
"C-235"	"#C-235 (2005-04-12 (20)) I was going to Spain again, and I don't know how I was going to swing it, being a student here. I think I was taking a leave of absence or something. And I lived here, and in my dream the night before I was supposed to leave, I decided I was going to turn on my sound system and blast some classic rock kind of stuff. And I didn't think Jill was here; it was like 12:30 at night. And so I blasted it, and then five minutes later I realized that she might be here and she might be sleeping. Now this is all in my dream, you know. And so I turned it down, but I couldn't get it to go quiet enough, so I turned it off. And I laid back down and Jill came and knocked on my door and said, ""Are you ready to wake up now?"" And so they got me up again. I dreamt that she was going to Spain with me. So we packed, we kind of packed our stuff together, and then I guess Jill turns into Astrid somehow and I dreamt that Astrid was going with me. Maybe _____ there were these other people. And I dreamt that these different teachers were driving students to the airport. There was this big open field where we were standing waiting to go, and I was pretty sad about leaving for some reason. I was kind of excited and sad at the same time, but I was telling Dad how the last time I was gone, one month kind of felt like two years, and I was saying how I was going to be sad about not hearing any English for a while. And I don't know, he said something like, I don't know, something in _____ forgot what it was now. And so me and these three other people piled into Mrs. Hollander's car. I was in the front, Astrid and two 10-year-old boys were in the back, even though this was supposed to be high school students. I don't know how me and two 10-year-olds got to go, but it was something. And we started driving down the road, down these rural country roads, looking at this rural scenery on the way to the airport. And she said, ""What radio station do you guys like to listen to?"" And I like ________. This 10-year-old boy said that there was one called ""Blah"" and [laugh] it was just sort of like a version of 93.3 in Westport where they talk a lot, so we listened to that for a while. And then she flipped over to something on am for a while. And then we were at this rest stop, and so we're still on the way to the airport, we're at a rest stop, though. And I have a handful of money. I have some American quarters, two American dimes, two American pennies and two 200 poseida (?) coins. Boy, I'm wasting tape here; oh well. And I'm standing at this rest stop and everybody's kind of going and doing their thing. And the 10-year-old boy suddenly turns into a 16-year-old and he gets out of Mrs. Hollander's car and Mrs. Hollander gives him a coupon for beer, but she says, ""Now you must come back with non-alcoholic beer."" And I'm standing there and everybody's running off and I feel kind of sad still, and Mom shows up at this rest stop. And I'm standing there and I'm kind of leaning on her, like I do, and telling her all about how I feel and stuff. And she's kind of there like saying goodbye, and then she said, ""Hey, come on. Come with me because I need to surprise you."" When we were at the place where the cars and the buses pull in, there's like a busy road, and on this busy road there's this place for walkers. It's like a revolving door, but it's not. It's like a track, a people mover that's only very, very narrow that you have to step on, and it curves you around across the street in kind of a curved shape, and it's supposed to keep you from getting hit by cars when you cross the street. And it had this thing between the place where the vehicles in and all of the like drink stands and stuff at the restaurant. So Mom says, ""Hey, come with me."" And she thinks she's going to cheer me up by taking me over to this drink stand and buying me a Slurpy. And actually I was going to buy it with my 200 poseida (?) coin, but we were still in America. I don't understand that. So she hurried across this thing and she forgot that I can't jump on this thing without somebody helping me. It's like, whenever I get on a boat, I always have to have somebody take my hands and kind of make sure I don't step in the water, instead of, you know, it's a thing about depth perception. And so I'm standing there and I'm standing there and I'm waving my hand and yelling for help, for somebody to help me get across this thing so that we'd still have some time to drink our Slurpy before we had to get on the road. And I drop my 200 poseida coins in the mulch and I'm waving my hands and yelling for somebody to help me, and this nice boy who was getting off the thing helps me get on it, like takes my two hands and helps me step the right distance, and he even picks up my 200 poseida coins and gives them back to me. As I jump on this thing and I almost fell backwards, and I grab the person in front of me's shoulders just so that I could keep my balance and not fall off. And I'm on this thing and I'm almost to the Slurpy stand, and then I woke up."
"C-236"	"#C-236 (2005-04-15 (20)) I was in Westport and we were going to go to the Night Parade or something. I had this really big over-sized storybook with like 20 point font in them, and they were all laying around the living room, and I don't remember why, but we were sitting in the living room talking about things that when the police are going by in the parade they would look for. And what kind of a red flag go up with FBI agents. One of the things that Dad said that he would find commonly in the department is that when somebody sends an SOX message, the police and the FBI would think they would mix it up with some other kind of message that would mean that they're getting ready to have a plot to blow something up or something. You know that an SOX message really is the start of exclusive ______. When somebody's sending SISEX messages, but apparently it had the certain number of zeros and ones that just matched up to something bad in this dream. And I don't know where that would come from, but then the next part of this dream, I was upstairs in the bathroom and I had a silver mixer. It was like shiny silver and the faders were g____ silver. It was just all silver and it had little LEDs on it that would come on when a certain channel was active. So I sat this silver mixer on one TV tray and I set up the keyboard on two more TV trays, and I think I had some kind of other, I think I set up the CD player on the floor and ran wires to it all. And I don't remember why I did that. I don't know how I was going to amplify it in the bathroom either, but I think Mom just wanted to see how it was set up. And then we were upstairs on the little landing area hallway, and that old CC TV was still over there, and I had this big over-sized storybook about The Night Before Christmas, I guess, and I was reading it there and Mom was reading it out loud, like as I moved the tray across and I chose a word, she would read them out loud. And Dad was coming up the stairs wondering what we were doing, and Mom was like, ""We're reading a story about Santa Claus."" And I was kind of embarrassed because this was the middle of the year and Night Parade time. And then I woke up."
"C-237"	"#C-237 (2005-04-16 (20)) First I dreamt that I had to walk to Fourth Street Shipping in the middle of the night for some reason. And it was really hot. And I was in Westport, and I got there and I got the package to them, and coming back I went by Circle Lake Park, which is totally in the opposite direction, but I passed it in my dream. And I had _______ because they were blocking the way, and then there was a school bus dropping kids off at that hour, and as the bus stopped I kind of ran ahead of it so I could get by all the commotion. And then, when I got back, the next little scene was that it was daytime and for some reason Dad had to go out of town to deal with something with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, I think, and I think Uncle Carl was over here at Westport helping us out with some things around the house while he was away. And I think Mom was going to hang some wash outside and she wanted us to play a tape for her in the bedroom out the window like you do so that she could hear it out there. Now in my dream by the bedroom receiver there was still a tape deck, and for some reason Uncle Carl was sitting in the bedroom and he wanted me to go ahead and put it on, but then he started to work with it, and when he turned it on, it was on tuner and it was on like 94.1 or something, but he said that a message popped up and then displayed that said, ""Low power, do not adjust the volume."" And he said that it translates to that the whole house was on less than 110 volts and that the power company had somehow messed up there. And Uncle Carl went to go tell her that, and he called her Nimp. He said, ""Nimp, guess what?"" In real life he doesn't; he calls her Maggie or something like that. And just about that time I woke up."
"C-238"	"#C-238 (2005-04-18 (20)) Man, where are the days going? They're just moving by. Before I know it, I'm going to be graduating, and I'm going to be kind of sad about leaving this place. Well, no, I'll be sad about leaving Modern Media College because I'm enjoying it here so much, but I'll be so happy to leave ______. I might stay in this place if I find a job or an internship around here. I kind of like this apartment complex. But anyway, that's beside the point. This morning I was having little dreams that I was naked in here and I was walking around and that I had my door open and Jill's parents were cooking some food out in the kitchen. Jill came in here, she was wearing all black, which she never does, and she came in here and she started digging through my stuff in the closet. And she said she was, she didn't say it, but I had the notion that she was looking for something of hers, and she was digging and digging through a couple piles of stuff, and then she left. And I decided okay, it was time to get dressed, and I got dressed, and she came back and she started digging through stuff on my desk. And I was pretty upset, but I didn't say anything. Then I looked on my wall, and I realized that I only had three pictures and there were maybe 20 that Jill had in here. And I don't know, that was just crazy. And I dreamt that I had a little ______ from Astrid, that she sent me, and I was going to write to her and tell her thank you. And that's about it."
"C-239"	"#C-239 (2005-04-21 (20)) I was back in Westport again and that we were walking with Sandra. She had come to town. And apparently it was one of those things where she got home from the airport and she rented a car to get to our place. And she didn't do that much unpacking; she just put her bags down and we went for a walk. And she had some shoes that she couldn't walk in very well, and we didn't get too far. Then I had the notion that Mom and Dad were having some kind of a tiff and were trying to hide it from Sandra, as usual. And apparently Sandra kind of thought she wanted to go to a nice _____ shop, but she realized she wasn't going to get that far in those shoes of hers, so we turned around and I'm trying to think, there was something else to this whole thing. I can't remember what it was though. And then it seemed that I flipped to this other scene where I was in the living room there in Westport and my computer was set up on the roll top desk. And I needed to download some Norton updates and I wanted Mom to sit next to me while I did it, so she would get used to what that looked like and realize that none of the operation like that is a big ordeal or a bad thing. And so she pulled up the other chair -- actually in this dream I got up and she moved the big round chair in, and I kind of sat on her lap and I kind of did the navigating because she wanted me to, and she sat with her arm around my shoulder and kind of watched. And I think towards the end something might have screwed up. I think that the updates required me to restart and I couldn't restart for some reason. Something was still running or something got screwed or something. And Mom was like, ""Oh yeah, that always happens,"" because it seems like for her nothing ever goes right. And then I woke up."
"C-240"	"#C-240 (2005-04-23 (20)) It was Christmas time back in Westport and we had our choo-choo train set up around the Christmas tree like we do. And on the way it really is, I honestly don't remember what color it is, but it just goes around the track and goes, ""clackety-clack, ding ding ding ding."" Well, this one in my dream, there were three cars just like the real one, but in my dream all three of them were red and all three of them had flashing lights on them. And the thing with this train is, just like the real one, in order to start it and stop it, you had to flip a switch on the side of the engine, and in order to stop it or something, you had to do it while it was moving, so it was an act of catching it. But there was this other little thingy on the engine that would have like 20 or 30 different patch sounds saved, just like on a keyboard in M___ or something, except these were patch sounds of combinations of train sounds like a train would make while it's going down the track. And there was a certain patch that would make it go, ""Beep beep beep"" as it was going forward, but when you'd make it go backwards, it would be the scary back-up alarm sound like, ""Doo do, doo do,"" and I knew in this dream it did that a few times and I was a little scared, but I wasn't terrified. And in the caboose -- in the real one there's a little compartment where you can put candy and stuff, but in my dream we put three chocolate bunnies in there, like about 3"" high, hollow ones, and we stuck them in there and they rode in there like passengers. And we were getting ready to go somewhere and I wanted to grab a chocolate bunny, and I reached down under the tree and I grabbed it, and somehow the thing turned on and started going backwards and making that sound. And then I woke up."
"C-241"	"#C-241 (2005-04-24 (20)) First of all, I dreamt that it was kind of like the middle of summer and I sort of had the notion that I had graduated from Modern Media College, but then again other aspects seemed to indicate that I was back in high school. So I really don't know where I was. And I had the keyboard set up on TV trays in the bedroom because Mom had handed me a piece of sheet music and wanted me to sight read it. She was sitting down on the floor and she found this page under the bed, and it was all full of dust. I don't even remember what song it was, but I was all set to go, I had it in my hands and I was ready to go. And Dad came home. [laugh] And he was going to come in the bedroom and read or something or do his taxes I think. And I was going, ""Ahhhhhhhhh,"" but I tried to stay calm and I said, ""Could you please go outside? I have to do something yet."" And he went outside, yet he seemed to know all along what was going on. He seemed to know that I had something up my sleeve and all, and the thing had turned a greenish color while all that was going on, a light yellowish green and still kind of shiny. I don't know; that was messed up, man. And then I don't remember what happened. I think I quick shoved it under the bed or something."
"C-242"	"#C-242 (2005-04-24 (20)) I could walk from home to my high school somehow, or maybe not. Maybe I was even back at Bancroft Middle School, but I could walk to school. But I had the option to take the bus home if I wanted. And I had to deposit some money in the Mercantile Bank. I don't remember why, but the one day I didn't make it over there because class let out before they were still open, after it had closed, I guess, I couldn't get in. And the next day I was going to try and get over there. You know how we had a situation where our car battery was kind of weak, and for a while there we thought it was because the radio, like the digital tuner, had to draw memory supply of power with the yellow layer that was a very, very little amount? Well, get this! In this dream Dad wanted me to write a letter to the Mercantile Bank asking if they knew anything about why that would happen. And he was showing me a schematic of the machine and all its IC's and its bank of capacitors and this and that and the other. And then I woke up."
"C-243"	"#C-243 (2005-04-25 (20)) I was staying in a hotel room with Jill and I don't know if it was a hotel room or if it was an apartment that I was just staying and renting for a week. But we were there and I was going to do some kind of live sound gig thing and she was going to do some kind of business thing. And we were in this strange city that I'd never been in before, and I had the notion that we were kind of connected with a big group of people, but we just had this place to ourselves and the other people were going to catch up with us later. Each of us had all of our stuff. This was like a little pit stop that we made after graduation, before we moved back to where we were going to move back to. So here we are in this place. I think it was, I think it was a three-story place. Well yeah, it was a three-story place, but the rooms were tiny. The second story was nothing; it was just bleah. And the third story looked like Grammy's attic. Man, I haven't thought about that place for a while. And the first story kind of looked like our place here in Cedar Park. The second story was just an interim hallyway thing. So each of us had all of our stuff. I had all of my furniture and all of my sound equipment and all kinds of stuff, and so did she. And we were packing everything up in a trailer and I was going back to -- I can't remember if I was going back to Westport or if I was going over to Cedar Park here. But I was going to one of those places. The mixer and keyboard I had left at this place that we were staying at, in one of their little closets. I was so like stunned and shocked and disappointed that I left these things there, these really important things. I called the place right back and I said, ""Did you find these things there?"" and they said, ""Yes, we did,"" and they were going to send them to me UPS. Well, they sent me this really big UPS box, but instead of those things that I had left, they sent me like tons of like soaps and candles and hair brushes and mirrors and all these things that I kind of had the notion that were mine, that I had also left there, that I didn't even know I left there. But I was really worried because I wasn't going to get those really important things back, I don't think. And then I woke up, and I was so, oh, I was so relieved."
"C-244"	"#C-244 (2005-04-26 (20)) I had an off-the-wall dream last night, and I didn't remember it until I was in the middle of class today. Isn't that funny? I think somebody said something or did something and it just all came back to me. I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School taking PE with Mrs. Swenson again, and she was a real cool, relaxed, laid back kind of person. Well, both of them were -- Mr. Jameson was mean to everybody else but nice to me for some reason, maybe because I was nice to him from the start. I don't know. But I dreamt that I was back with Mrs. Swenson and there was a gate at the back of the tennis court leading to the track that was one of those crazy emergency exit doors with the stupid alarm things, except the alarm wasn't just at the door; it triggered the whole fire alarm system for the whole school. And there were two of these doors, one at each end of the tennis court. These things had sound things on the fence that were really loud, and the one was loud. It was, I think somebody said it was like 100 db, and the other one was like 130 db. And, let me think, so the school was going to have a fire drill. I think they had to do it like twice a month instead of just once a month like standard is for Pen______ County Schools, but they couldn't just do it once [laugh] , they had to do it one time when they opened the one door and another time when they opened the other door, so they had to do it twice, one hour apart. And so instead of going to the panel in the office and making the alarm go off, they just opened that door, and Mrs. Swenson had to have us doing jumping jacks as we walked through that door to out to the track where we were supposed to stand until they gave us the all-clear. We were supposed to either do jumping jacks or _______ lift things or twist or arm circles or some kind of aerobic exercise as we were marching out that door. And it was really tough because I'm an audio engineer and going right past all that loud business is not good. So Mrs. Swenson gave me two huge mike pop filter-like type things, one to put on each side of my head, kind of to cover over my ears, but more like on top of my head, sort of like. And she said they would filter out most of the high frequencies as well as cut the volume considerably, because -- according to her in my dream -- the high frequencies pierced through the air the most and wrecked your hearing the fastest. And I think some of this came from the Rupert Meade (?) tape that we saw about a fundamental sound with harmonics, and I started thinking about that terrible, awful alarm in the Westport High School Building 3 and how it's got that kind of buzzy harmonic thing going on in it, and I think that might be where this came from. So I put these things on the sides of my head and they opened the door, and it really did cut down on the volume and I did jumping jacks out that door, just like everybody else did. And then I woke up."
"C-245"	"#C-245 (2006-02-25 (20)) Wow, I thought I was through with the tape thing, but I guess I'm not. We'll see. Last night I had a dream that I was taking classes again at Westport High School, but that I had definitely made up my mind that I wanted to major in Music, and I wanted to minor in Education, I think, something like that. But I was already going for this degree while I was a magical aerospace engineer, and what that means is pretty much a fancy term for studying illusions and stuff. I was studying to be a magician, and I knew that was going to be like a nothing degree. And when Westport College has you seeking a degree from them, they give you this little pink plastic case with these red laminated cards in it telling people what you are. And I opened my pink case and I had three cards in it that said, ""Jasmine Henderson, Illusionary Aerospace Engineer."" And I just thought that was so ridiculous, and I wanted to change my major and I wanted to know if that was possible. And so I was looking through the brochure for the number for Guidance. There were phone numbers for principals and teachers and all kinds of offices, but no phone number for Guidance or Admissions or General Information. I couldn't find any of those numbers, and I think kind of stuck and lost. And that was really all there was to it. I woke up."
"C-246"	"#C-246 (2006-03-02 (20)) I was still living with Jill. We were in this house that was sort of a combination of your typical modern house, our house and my apartment, and our families were there. And Jill and I really got on each other's nerves, but our families seemed to not mind each other at all. The scene that I can remember is that I was in the bathtub washing up my feet and stuff, and I was totally naked, and Jill wanted to use the bathtub when I was done. And I asked her, ""Do you want me to let the water out of the tub and put new water in for you, or do you want to wash in the same water as me?"" And she's like, ""Oh, Jasmine, nobody washes in any kind of water that anybody else washed in."" So I figured, okay, so I let the water out and there were a whole bunch of people in the bathroom watching me. And I swished it down the drain with my feet, and Mom carried me, wrapped me in a towel, and she carried me right from the bathroom right out to her bike. And I was wrapped in a towel, and Dad had his bike. And Mom rode me in the basket of her bike, just like we used to, and they said, ""We've got a surprise for you."" And I'm like, ""Well, you can't take me anywhere if I'm not dressed."" But we were riding down the street and we came to this place that was called Discovery Track. It really sounds familiar, but I'm not really sure if it's a real place or not. We got off the bike, and I was dragging some kind of a cart behind me for a minute, and we were walking along this narrow brick road thing, and everywhere we looked there were model classic cars. There was an old fire truck, a really old white pick-up truck, a couple of Corvettes, some black car with the booshy front, around in front, and there was a twin of our car, and there were two Cadillacs parked in a garage, and there was also like a, oh, I don't know, a spinning ride thing off in the corner. And I got the feeling that this whole thing was like an amusement park ride, where you would sit in one of these old cars and somebody else would drive it or it would drive itself kind of around and around and around this race track. And you'd get a little ride and you'd say, ""Oh whoopee, I rode in an old car,"" and then you'd get out. [laugh] Look, I had a feeling there was going to be something more to it for me because I was special, and so they were taking me off to see this little movie in a little garage-like type thing, and then I woke up."
"C-247"	"#C-247 (2006-03-13 (20)) Okay, let's see. Yeah, it's March 13, 2006. I started taking all of these massive tapes -- I have like a whole box full of these tapes in my closet, and I started taking them one by one, recording them to Cool Edit Pro, editing a few ""ums"" here and there, giving it some more amplitude gain to just kick it in the butt, and then saving it as an mp3 file and meticulously, methodically giving it a very specific file name like the date plus something else. And so when I go to start this tape, I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay, what did I leave off on? What file name did I give my last one?"" Oh no, I'm not supposed to be doing that, I'm supposed to be saying what today's date is. Well anyway, that was a waste of tape. I had a dream last night that there was some kind of tiff going on with Mom and Dad and Mom was going to take me to some place to kind of get out of the house, and she said it was a surprise. And we walked and we walked to this place that sort of looked like a pizzeria called Langman and Dingeys (?) that we used to go to a lot on 4th Street, but it's since closed. And we were having Coke and these little potato chicken nugget things, and we were going down the line getting them off this buffet. And then the scene shifted and I was leaving this pizzeria without Mom, and I crossed the street, I jay-walked like we do. And I went into this museum. I can't remember if I had a cane or not, but I don't think I did. And I was looking for something in particular in there, but I had a feeling there was going to be this class in there about some kind of history or something. And this boy -- probably about 16 or 17 -- I don't know his name, but he was real nice -- he was going to be a student in this class too, and he was asking me to sit in on this class. And I said, ""Yeah, sure, I will."" And so he took my arm, he didn't give me his, but he sort of grabbed my upper arm like Mom does when she's crossing me across the street or something, and started leading me down this hallway. It was a white, it started off with carpet on the floor, but then it was white. And it was this little incline. It sort of went up and then it went down, and there were all these little offices to our left and to our right, and I was looking in windows and I saw these flat surfaces in there and I said, ""Are those mixing consoles or just office desks?"" And he said, ""There are both in there."" And I was like, ""Wowee!"" And by this time an instructor, probably in his 40's and I think two other boys and three other girls, joined us and we were all going to this little room that was going to have this class. And we finally got there, and it's this small, stuffy little room with a table and a bunch of cleaning supplies and stuff next to it. It kind of reminded me of the room at Oceanside Elementary's library where Ms. Garland and I used to work with the CC TV and stuff when she would see me. And I was thinking back to the library room at Oceanside Elementary and how they had a fire extinguisher on the wall that I thought was really an alarm or something, and they had one of these weird exit doors, which this room in my dream did, except this room in my dream had a double door like Westport High School's Media Center did. And the instructor sat us down at the table and said, ""Okay, we need to do a fire alarm because it's in my curriculum and I have to do it once a month."" Now why I keep having bad dreams about schools and fire drills is beyond me. I think that's like long past, that's like water under the bridge. I don't know why I keep having dreams about that, but anyway he just opened the door matter-of-factly. He opened both doors actually and put the stopper things down, and an alarm sounded, but only a few of them sounded, far off in the distance, you know how that goes? And so I was like, ""Okay, this is not too bad of a deal,"" and we all walked out and we all went to this bus lane thing, you know how we always do. And we came back in through the front door when it was all over, and we walked down a little hallway ramp thing all together, past the offices, into this little room thing. And he said, ""Sorry, folks, but I have to do it again."" [laugh] And he said, he was saying that somebody had redone the wiring because apparently before one of the alarm boxes was very unreliable and it would just set off the alarm system if anybody just breathed wrong. [laugh] And he said that he wanted this history class to be an exciting and interesting thing, but some of the students were afraid and unwilling to go in this room because of that factor. And so he had them redo the wiring, and apparently we had to do this again to make sure that the wiring was kosher and all. So this time he opened both doors matter-of-factly again. Oh man, it was horrible. So we ran out of the room and we went to the middle of this bus lane like you have to do, then we went back in the front way and we were going into the room again, and we said, ""Okay, now we can sit down and have our little class."" And then I woke up."
"C-248"	"#C-248 (2006-03-14 (20)) Mom and Aunt Christine were in our kitchen here at home, and Mom was putting a CD in her little, cheap little CD player thing on the kitchen counter area by the microwave. And Aunt Christine was telling Mom that Allen Toussaint was in a nursing home and some criminal had come in there and chopped off his head. And for whatever reason the people let the body sit there for a year in the nursing home. And whoever it was came back a year later to chop off his hand. And I don't remember what happened with all of that, but I remember seeing this little TV show about the whole ordeal and the criminal was prosecuted. And some -- I think Bruce Springsteen or some band put together this tribute CD for him. They got all kinds of singers and all kinds of people and performers to get together and perform his songs, and they were playing this CD in the kitchen. And this dream Allen Toussaint and Professor Longhair were the same person. [laugh] And so this was the great loss of that persona. I'm trying to think now, I know there was a whole ordeal going on before this. I think it was when Aunt Christine was telling Mom about everybody and their brother who had been murdered last week. That's weird. [laugh] Oh, and I also remember some of us being in the living room and asking Dad about how cops aim when they're going to shoot somebody. I don't know why I was dreaming all this; it's just sort of funny. But let's see, Allen Toussaint covered S________ and I heard that on 89.7 last week. And I went to sleep with a sore wrist, and the neighbor, Cassandra's best friend, Corinne's daughter, Eddie hurt, I mean, Eddie hurt his hand a couple of days ago and it seemed like it was going to be really bad, but it wasn't. And that's all I can think. I don't know what I was thinking."
"C-249"	"#C-249 (2006-03-17 (20)) This is St. Patrick's Day. I had a brief dream last night. Lately I've been doing the same where my body's gearing up for the time change and so I've been waking up at 6:00, going pee, getting a drink of water and then usually I lay back down because I'm just barely navigating and I don't really want to get up when it's still dark. And so in that morning between 6:00 and 7:00 I had a brief dream that Duane and Janelle were out of town, but where they were was at this Festival of Dolls, I think Mom was calling it. And I sort of had a vision as if I was there with them. And in my dream Duane and Janelle plus Cassandra and Courtney and Corinne and Eddie were all like one big happy family, which to me, in my eyes, they are. And it would be really nice if we would all know each other and be friends. But anyway, I had a vision like I was there at this thing of theirs and everywhere I went I was hearing bells going, ""Ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding,"" kind of like that song we do and kind of like how it is. Oh gosh, I can't think how it goes, I think it's C, E, D, G, C, E, D, G -- you know how bells are. And so I was hearing bells and I was in this back yard that was bigger than ours, but looked about the same as ours. And it was dark out and there was a big swing, and I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun. And I was making the swing spin around and twist all around and swing, and just have fun. And Eddie was on another swing, and Mom said, ""Be careful, you're not wearing a bra. You don't want Eddie to see your boobs, do ya?"" And at this party I was like totally naked. [laugh] And I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun, and my boobs were bouncing all over, of course. And then I woke up. I can't remember anything more. [laugh] I know I had some other dreams, but they were kind of boring and I didn't remember them after that morning hour."
"C-250"	"#C-250 (2006-03-19 (20)) It was very close to my birthday and that Samantha, Sandra and Derek and I think Mickie were in town, again too, but this time I think it was only Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and there were an extra friend or two in the house, but none of the spouses. And they were all in our living room kind of sitting around and lazing around like they do. And I think Mom and Dad were somewhere in the house. And I think they were all trying to get a surprise together for me because they were wanting me to go over to the pool and swim at the pool for a while and leave them be at home. And in my dream this pool was located kind of in the same place that Circle Lake is, so it was only a hop and a skip away. Somehow I crossed the street and everything. So I put on my bathing suit, head out the back door, walk down the alley and go over to the pool, and I swim at the pool. And I would come home early and I would do everything I could to be quiet. I would leave the pool gate very carefully, I would sort of walk slowly down the alley and into the back, but Dad would always be working in the garage and he would always see me coming home. So I would come in the house and say hi to everybody and then go back to the pool. So I did that a couple of times, like three times. And the last time I came in, I was pretty sure I saw them wrapping something, or something like that, and then they were going to pile in the car and go somewhere. I'm not sure where; it couldn't have been a restaurant because we had food in the car that we were eating. I had my 7-eleven cup that spills if you just breathe on it the wrong way. I had some kind of food that I was trying to eat and trying not to let it spill. All the girls were in the back, Mom was next to me and Derek was driving, and Dad wasn't around. Whoopee! And Derek was driving well, I mean we were just going on an adventure, having fun, and I woke up before we ever got where we were supposed to go."
"C-251"	"#C-251 (2006-03-21 (20)) The birthday drama is building, and I had a dream to support it last night. I think it started out that Josie and two of her friends were in town and were staying in the room where Samantha and Sandra used to sleep, and the twin beds were still there. And they had this whole thing of jewelry, this whole like store display plaque shelf type thing that was about three feet high with everything under the sun dangling off of it. And they said I could borrow anything I wanted while they were here, and it was at the foot of the bed on this trunk like Sandra had. And so I took off a bracelet that was silver with stars on it, and I went around the house cleaning up various things. And I think I was out in the front yard, and a UPS man came by to deliver something, and he said I was getting a Nord Electro for my birthday. And he took this tall, long box off of his truck, kind of wide, but coming up to my chest level, and it was so heavy, he helped me get it onto the porch. And I was thinking, ""Yahoo! My dream is finally coming true, finally getting something like this for my birthday."" But then it started to get tall and skinny, and it started to kind of shrink, and the box had an open front so that I could look into the box and I could touch the thing. And it was this tall, skinny baby toy-like type thing. It was still bright red, but, I mean, it was nothing like a professional thing that a Nord Electro really is. And I was thinking, ""What?! You mean to tell me this is my present?"" And by that time it was small enough and light enough that I could pick it up and just put the whole thing behind the blue chair in the living room and just pretend that I'd never even seen it. And then the next little scene was brief and fleeting, but I dreamt that I was in Jim's living room and he had a class of maybe ten or twelve, maybe even fifteen other students and me. His living room was a little bigger to accommodate us, and his instruments were spread out a little more. And we were at tables that looked like cafeteria tables, and I was in the very back. Well anyway, I remember he was passing around little worksheets for us and going into detail about explaining theory and stuff, not necessarily having us do anything hands-on. And he was having to stop and get everybody back on track and kind of discipline the talkers and stuff, just like Mr. Hanover would have to do. And after a little bit of that, I woke up. I think that scene came from the fact, flipping through the Thompson's First Grade Book, I see little quizzes and things and little things that are geared toward keeping students on track, and I can see how the unimpassioned student would get bored real fast. But, of course, I see all that as a means to an end."
"C-252"	"#C-252 (2006-03-23 (20)) I was back in Oceanside Elementary and I was going to eat lunch in the cafeteria with a couple of other girls and a boy. And what the thing of it was that part of your grade related to whether you went up to the cafeteria buffet and served other people along with yourself, or whether you just served yourself. And I was in the line and there were only like three people behind me, and there was this boy ahead of me. And they had this kind of yukky turkey and pork fiber that was supposed to be a sandwich, but really wasn't it. And he plopped some of that on my plate and I was thinking, ""I can't serve this to anybody else; there's not enough."" And some of the ladies behind the counter were going to give me more, or put more out for the people, and there were like little containers of fruit and little containers of jello, and I really wanted one but I didn't have enough money. So I took my measly little pork dish up to the cash register and paid for it and the lady wrote on my receipt that I got a 50 because I didn't serve anybody else. And then somewhere alone in this dream I felt like the cafeteria had a subwoofer under the stage and that there was a sound system that they were going to play for us during lunch. And that in a few days the cafeteria was going to be closed for a few weeks so they could remodel and retweak the sound system in some way. And then I was back home upstairs in my bedroom, and I had the feeling that I was still really close to that cafeteria, like it was downstairs in our house, and I wanted to go get something more because I was still hungry in my dream. And then I woke up."
"C-253"	"#C-253 (2006-03-26 (21)) As you can tell, I feel awful today. I don't know what's going on with my body, but Dad was real sick a few days ago and I think he passed it right along to me. But also I don't feel good because I was almost sure that yesterday was going to be my party, and, of course, they didn't have my party yesterday. And so I had two dreams last night. The first dream I have a faint recollection of being in the living room with Mom. Get this: there was still a Christmas tree in there, and there was a coffee table where we put it when we put the Christmas tree. And I was wrapping these dumb little presents for myself with Mom and this paper with roses on it and stuff. There was like a little cheap toy watch and some hair bows and things, and a CD or something that I was wrapping for myself. And Mom had a box about the size of a shoebox that she was wrapping up, that she didn't want me to see. And I felt like it was going to be something a little bit better, but I didn't think it was going to be all that great. And so then we were putting these presents like under the Christmas tree, and still in my dream I didn't know when my party was going to be. And I'm walking around the house doing other things, and I kept checking behind the blue chair to see if maybe there were extra presents back there. And I kept waiting and looking all around the living room for a long box, and I didn't see it and I didn't see it, and I was waiting for this long box to appear. And I was so sure that it would and it didn't. And then I woke up. It was like 5:00 in the morning. I think I went pee or something and then I went back to sleep. It was freezing cold. This is going to be the coldest birthday I've ever had. And I dreamt that I was riding the bike with Mom in the dark and I had no pants on. And we go into this restaurant, like a pizzeria. It looks like CC's Pizza, like we went to before my job interview. And we were walking around and I had no pants on and I was real self-conscious and there were all these girls all around. And then I realized that this was going to be strip joints and that people were going to think I was a prostitute because I had no pants on. And then I think we rode around town a little bit more. Mom had some other place she wanted to take me. Oh, I knew there was some more to this. I think there was this really strange book on the dining room table with a red cover. And it was about musical instruments. It wasn't about the art of being a slut or anything. But somehow I had the notion that it was this really weird book about instruments that sane people wouldn't want to read. And then I woke up."
"C-254"	"#C-254 (2006-03-28 (21)) It's the day before my birthday, man, and I'm feeling a whole lot better. Thank goodness! I don't know what hit me the other day. But last night I had kind of a stupid dream, but I think it makes a little bit of sense. I dreamt that Mom and I were in the park, laying on a blanket, and it was kind of cloudy in the sky, but not really going to rain or anything. And she was having a look across the lake with my distance _______ to see somebody over there that was going to be water skiing. And get this: my distance _______ had this flat plastic boggling (?) figure of Goofy on it dangling from the lanyard thing on an extra string, and Mom said that that was supposed to indicate the reference point of where the ground level was. Now what that has to do with anything, I don't know. But I looked across the lake and I saw the water skier, and he water-skied by and I was thinking, ""Okay, so what?"" So a little while later Terri showed up. She brought with her a schedule for me because I was starting high school the next day, except it didn't look like the little sheet of paper that Westport High School used to give me every year. It was a full sheet of paper like I get from Modern Media College like I print out from their web site. And it was formatted just like they did. So I was going to go to Westport High School again. I only had to go to two or three classes a day, but I had to get up at like 6:00 in the morning to be at school by 7:00, and I was thinking to myself, ""Oh gosh, ______ are going to kill me; I hate doing this."" And then the scene shifted and I was at an art show with Mom. And I was helping her pack stuff up. We were folding chairs and loading stuff in the truck. And Courtney and Haley were there. And then I woke up. Now, as you probably know, Haley just moved down here and she's enrolling in Southwest High School, so that's probably where that came from. And, oh, let's see what else. Mom has an art show coming this Saturday, so I think that's where that came from. This is just rather dumb, I think."
"C-255"	"#C-255 (2006-04-04 (21)) We were at a stadium watching the Super Bowl in another city. From their like big screen-like type thing. We were in a VIP box, and so we brought our receiver and a few things to do the audio support. And somewhere in this plot I was heading for Centerville the next day, and I was getting calls from Frieda Thurston and Laura from my bus, and people I used to know, Marilyn and Noelle and I think Samantha. Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there too again. And what a lot of this line I was thinking about how I am going to Centerville, but I have no clue what I'm going to do over there. I'm not going back to Modern Media College. I'm not even going to have a job in the audio industry. I'm going to leave Duane and Janelle. I'm going to get up and move, but what am I going to do when I get over there? So I was letting that thought go through my mind, and, you know, the Super Bowl and all this starting and this and that, and then the audio was kind of low because I was on the phone. And in this VIP box we had a Christmas tree and a couple of little Christmas village things underneath it, I guess because it was that time of year, right after Christmas. And so Mom was talking a little about putting in the CD ______ and I said I would do it in a few minutes. And so, get this: in the back of the VIP box across the hall there was this gift shop with fancy bowls and fancy cups full of glitter that they were selling. Everybody's sound equipment was staged in there and wired up so that it could work. And I asked Mom to turn up the volume on our receiver because Eva Cassidy was starting to sing ""Imagine."" And she went in the gift shop, but instead of turning up the volume, she changed the input selection. And then she was all confused and I said, ""________ they were the gift shop."" Anyway, I came through the door of the gift shop and I asked Mom, ""Where is our receiver? I don't know where it is. If you show me where it is, I'll take care of it."" So she does like she does when I'm trying to find something in the refrigerator. She leads me to the general area, she says, ""It's in the middle,"" and then she runs away. And I'm looking around this little area she pointed me to, there's lots of glittery bowls and cups that are plastic, there's somebody else's receiver, there's a bunch of t-shirts and stuff, but I can't find ours. And it's like that was very frustrating. "
"C-256"	"#C-256 (2006-04-05 (21)) It's late at night again. I am a bad procrastinator. Last night I had a dream, a really, really weird dream, that I was back at Westport High School again, I was in the Little Theater, the small theater where Mrs. Dougherty and her chorus used to rehearse, and there was a big acoustic grand piano on stage with a dark finish. But it had this electrical switch wired to the wooden ledge above the keys, and the reason why this existed like this is so that the performer could sit on stage and warm up and get ready to perform, and then he wouldn't have to get up for anything. He could just flip this switch on the ledge there and the curtains would open and the lights would dim and he wouldn't have to move. And he could just address his audience. But the only thing was that something weird, something wasn't wired right with this wiring, and so instead of the curtains opening and the lights dimming, the fire alarm would go off. And so the theater is kind of empty when I'm in there and it's starting to fill up gradually and I'm waiting for this concert and I'm really getting excited about this concert that they're going to do. And I was with a girl, a friend named Alicia, and she was sitting a few rows back and I got to see her when she was a year younger than me. I was still in high school, I guess, in this dream. And then I heard the people in neighboring seats chattering to me about how this wiring might not be so great anyway, and so it's time for him to perform, it's time for the pianist to come out and perform. And I'm like so afraid because of this, because I think the alarm is going to sound when he wants to dim the lights or something. And so, sure enough, that's what happened, but I didn't hear any alarm sounds in the Little Theater. It was like outside, outside in the hallways. But I'm so afraid that I'm yelling for Alicia to come. And I got up and I ran down the aisle and Alicia ran after me and we ran outside before the rest of the school alarms went off. Now I wonder where in the world all of this is coming from. I think the part about being back at Westport High School and stuff is the fact that I've been going through and putting all of my other dreams into mp3 files and Audio Audition, and, you know, I've been hearing my voice evolve sort of, and, you know, I've had lots of dreams about Westport High School and fire drills and stuff, and I think that might just be coming back to me. And, of course, Jim had me practice on his big acoustic one yesterday, so I had that exposure. But I can't help thinking there's a little more to do this, and it's sad. But that's the gist of it."
"C-257"	"#C-257 (2006-04-07 (21)) Merrilee was joining the United Nations ________ Center, and I think Merrilee turned into Cassandra later in this dream, but one of the ladies convinced Mom that I should join too, and they were going to this major convention at this hotel. And somehow I got separated from Mom and that neighbor, and I'm wandering around and I'm wandering around, and there's this big lobby with lots of stairs and lots of little side rooms and lots of people milling around. Everybody spoke English, but there were a lot of ethnic accents. And they were going to have this big banquet and the end goal of the whole dream was to get to the big banquet and meet up with Mom and Cassandra. So I went to the registration desk and I showed them my ID, and they said, ""Who did you come with?"" and I said, ""Maggie Henderson."" And they looked in their data base and they said, ""Oh yes, we have you."" And they gave me four choices of ______ to pay _____: fifty, twenty-five, fifteen or ten. So, of course, I paid the $10 because I didn't know what it was for. And then I went down this little hall, thinking I might find the banquet hall. And there was this room. By this time I met up with this lady who was helping kind of guide me along, and she was big and fat and a little rough, but she was kind and she sort of grabbed me by the arm and we were like walking around. She told me there was this private party going on in that room and I could hear an Irish jig going on. And then we went up a little couple of stairs and through a back hallway and go to this banquet hall that looked more like a restaurant. It had square wooden tables and we were sitting in wooden chairs. And there were no table cloths or anything on these tables, and Mom and Cassandra were sitting at a regular table, and they put Courtney and me at a little kids' table across the way. And it turns out that Mom and Cassandra and Courtney and everybody were getting fish fillets and vegetables, and all I got was a little piece of bread and half a cup of Shirley Temple in a Styrofoam cup. And I had only paid $10 to register, I was a junior member. And so then I woke up."
"C-258"	"#C-258 (2006-04-08 (21)) Apparently I was coming home from Jackson and I had ordered some kind of book online. And for some reason they shipped a live puppy with the book and I kept thinking, ""What in the world am I going to do with this puppy?"" It arrived at home while we were in Jackson for another week. And somebody up in Jackson had a green bird that was dying. I think it was Aunt Christine. And Cassandra's Eloise was dead because she was sick or something, and it seemed so real. Everybody over there was so sad, and I was too. And this puppy that was supposed to have come with the book was alive barely, and I was giving her sugary cereal to eat until we get her some other food. Oh, what else? I know there was a lot more to do. Oh, and I think my birdie had just died too, as he really did a week or two ago, and we were wondering what to do with him and stuff. And that's about it, all about being dream, was this dream."
"C-259"	"#C-259 (2006-04-14 (21)) I've been having some really weird dreams lately, but I've been really lazy about recording them. I notice that I'm also starting to write in my journal less and less, and I really have no excuse because I don't have a job yet. I'm just surfing the net all the time, either that or I'm just practicing. Anyway, last night I had kind of a vague dream that there was a man with two big dogs in front of Pete's house. They were totally black on top and their legs and their stomachs and their faces were tan. And they were growling at me. And one came real close to taking a big bite out of my chin. And the guy said that -- I can't remember what we did to calm him down, but the guy said that there was a trick to it, that I think they didn't mean any harm, but they were just hungry or something dumb like that. But I think the one actually did bite me after a while, and I was running away, trying to get away from him, and I ran down the alley into our back yard and Eloise showed up. And apparently she needed something too. She needed a new collar or something, and I got the feeling like she was thirsty. And she came up and just laid on my shoulder and kind of licked me, like she does to Cassandra. And I thought that was sweet, and I held her and petted her, and then I sort of woke up. And let's see, last night I had a dream that I was back at Westport High School, but that I was staying with Jill and this other girl she knew. I think this other girl was acting kind of like Courtney and Susan into one person. And Rianne ditched me for a roommate and this other girl took her place, that used to room with Jill, I guess. And so Jill had somebody else that was with her that was rooming with her. [laugh] Well, we were out in the bus circle at Bancroft Middle School, but the inside looked like Westport High School. And Jill knocked me down on the ground and took off my clothes, so I was running around buck naked. And I was wearing a really pretty orange dress, and Jill just knocked me down and took it off off me. And she put it on. And she was walking around school in this orange dress that was mine, and I was walking around naked. [laugh] And we were doing into this auditorium, I thought, and I had the feeling like it was okay to go to class naked, but it wasn't going to be okay to go to this party naked that we were going to go to. And so we're sitting in this auditorium waiting for this concert or play to begin, and we're right in the front row. And I'm naked and Jill is in my pretty orange dress, and the other two girls were in sloppy clothes. And then I woke up. [laugh] That was funny."
"C-260"	"#C-260 (2006-04-20 (21)) I was in some kind of grassy, open space. I felt like it was near my school, but I kind of felt like it was in my old apartment complex from Weir (?) Park and I was sitting there on a picnic blanket with a boyfriend that I had. I'm not sure who it was. It could have been Sean or Justin, or it could have been a younger version of Jim. And he was talking about Andrea Bocelli and how he had apparently started a charity and he was helping manage Andrea Bocelli's charity. And he was putting all kind of money in it, all kinds of jobs and donations and stuff. And we started talking about getting a drink of water, and Jill comes by and she's talking to us a little bit about different things about school, and then this boy says, ""I'm going to go in and get some water. I'm going to get some ice from the ice box in your refrigerator, okay?"" And I say, ""Okay, that's fine,"" and Jill goes, ""Oh no, I took a lot of time to fill up that ice tray, and I just don't feel it's right for somebody else to go in and get my ice."" And they kind of argued a little about it, and in the end it turned out that he was going to take some of the Andrea Bocelli money to go buy his own ice. And then I woke up."
"C-261"	"#C-261 (2006-04-29 (21)) I had a lot of catching up to do, and I cannot believe how much I just whizzed through this tape. I must be the master at wasting it. Well, anyway, last night I had a dream that I was watching Celine Dion on DVD for some reason again. I hadn't dreamt about Celine for a long time, and then she showed up again last night. I can't remember what she was singing, but I know she was singing something that I didn't know. I had the feeling like she might have sung two or three songs that I almost knew and then some that I just didn't. And she was in a red outfit, but it was more conservative than the one she wears for the Las Vegas show. And I don't remember what the other outfit was; I think the other one was all black. And it was supposed to be the Las Vegas show, I think, but there was this grayish background, and I think that was just sort of a transient dream that just sort of happened. Oh, and earlier this week I had a long epic dream with many dumb, little scenes in it, and I don't remember any of them now, of course. But one of the scenes I do remember was that Mom and I were at the Oceanside Park, the place where you go before you come to the beach. And she was riding her bike and I was walking, and I had the feeling like we were coming home from the pier, because we had just been there. And I was ahead of her, and she was riding her bike trying to catch up to me. And I decided I was going to walk back to her on the bike, I mean walk back to her and her bike, and so that I could walk alongside her and talk and stuff like that. So I'm going back to her and all of a sudden a couple of sprinklers turn on and they're spraying right at the sidewalk like the ones at Modern Media College used to do. And I decided, ""Whoops -- I don't think I could go that way."" And I was really afraid of these sprinklers in my dream. And so I turned around and kept going my own way, and I was going along my own way and going along and saying, ""Okay, she's just going to have to go through the sprinklers and get wet."" And so I'm a ways down the road, and then all of a sudden all the sprinklers turn on and they're all spraying right at the sidewalk and they're in the grass too. There's more in the grass spraying all over the grass. So it's sprinkle city as far as I can see, and this park as far as I can see, which probably isn't that far. But anyway, I'm standing there surrounded by sprinklers, getting soaking wet, and yelling for help, except I can't really yell. You know how it is in a dream. And then I find a little place where there's an intersection of a sidewalk where I can stand right in the middle of the intersection and not get too wet, but I'm still surrounded by all these sprinklers and I'm scared to death for whatever reason it is. And eventually Mom comes on the bike and her big back basket is as big as her front basket, and she puts me in her back basket and rides off, and I'm not getting wet any more once I'm on the bike, and I'm not even really afraid of the sprinklers any more. And then I faded into some other stupid thing. I thought this was just something dumb that occurred in my mind, but when I told Mom about it, she said that the sprinklers represent the circumstances of my life right now, I think, because I feel like I'm being surrounded and sort of led astray to some degree by going back to school, and I'm being kind of wrestled down and -- what should I say? -- closed in and trapped by all of that stuff. And I kind of tend to agree, I think. And, you know, she always tries to rescue me from bad emotional situations. So I guess that's what that is."
