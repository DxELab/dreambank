    "description": "Most of the dreams in this remarkable series were written down on his own initiative while \"Norman\" was a patient in various prison hospitals.  On some nights he reported two or three dreams.  Many of the reports are very brief, but the dreams are very revealing nonetheless.  The dreams were analyzed by Calvin S. Hall for a book by Alan P, Bell and Calvin S. Hall, The Personality of a Child Molester (1971).  For a summary of Hall's analysis, showing how well Norman's dreams reflect his life, not to mention his sexual preoccupations, see Chapter 8 of Domhoff's Finding Meaning In Dreams."
