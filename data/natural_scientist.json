    "description": "The person we call \"The Natural Scientist\" was born in 1893 in a small farming town in the Midwest. He graduated from a state university in 1916 and joined a federal government agency that did natural science work.  Except for nine months in the U.S. Army in 1918-1919, he worked as a natural scientist for the federal government until his early retirement due to declining health in the late 1940s.  There is no information on the life of the dreamer except for what appeared in a four-page obituary in a scientific journal.  This information reveals that his waking interests are reflected in his dreams and that he was a lifelong bachelor.  His dream journal was meant strictly for his own curiosity about the nature of dreams. (For more about the Natural Scientist, including his own preface to the dream journal, click here.)"
