    "description": "The 388 dreams in this set were collected in November 1996, January 1997, and February 1997, from girls attending a school in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The girls ranged from 4th through 9th grade, with 5th and 6th graders providing 51% of the dreams.  The girls wrote the dreams in diaries that they kept at home.  All identifying information has been removed, and the first names that are included are pseudonyms.  This set of dreams covers the longest age span -- six years -- from one school that is available in our dream database.  It also contains the best set of dreams from 4th, 5th, and 6th graders that is available anywhere, as far as we know.  (For more about this series, including a table with details about each dreamer, click here.)"
