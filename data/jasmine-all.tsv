"A-001"	"#A-001 (1999 (14)) I was at school with Mom, and her and I were up at this little mixing room type of a thing, up above on the third floor of the main building. But it was really supposed to be a computer lab. Anyway, sorry about that saw in the background. Anyway, Mom and I were in this room, and she bent something like a computer that makes it really stand out, and she has to get help from Uncle Larry. I think this is how it went. It was so complicated, I can't even remember it. But anyway, she makes the computer stand out, and Uncle Larry comes up and is criticizing me because I don't ever work with him on anything, and isn't going to help us now. Matter of fact, he threatens to activate the alarm system. And then I think somebody was riding around outside in a little golf cart thing like the administrators do, and for some reason or other we had to get out of there quick because he did something else with the computer that was going to start this virus thing going around the school. And so we got on this golf cart and we just drive, and I didn't recognize, and we went downstairs via the elevator into the library. Then we were talking with Mrs. Talmadge and she said that I had this problem with rocking back and forth, which I don't, but that the problem was common with blind people, but I don't have it. And Mrs. Talmadge said that I had a problem with rocking back and forth and that we needed to work on that."
"A-002"	"#A-002 (1999 (14)) And just last night I had a dream that Mom was filling up the gas tank of our red and white '55 red Chevy, and the ringer was down and she leaned in and said, ""Go on home. I'll meet you at home."" So the ignition started up by itself and I floored the accelerator and I started going 60 and 70 miles an hour on a regular city street, and before I knew it, I was going 90 or 100 and I suddenly screeched on the brake and I spun around and spun around and spun around, and I'm like, ""Oh no, am I crashing?"" And I woke up."
"A-003"	"#A-003 (1999 (14)) I dreamt that I was going to stay overnight in a fireman's house up north, and that I was packing my bed and stuff and getting in a tiny little car and going. When I got there, there were three other girls, and they had a swimming pool, but the house was real tiny, and it was a two-story house. It was kind of like I was living in this -- you know how movies are kind of gray sometimes? Well, everything looked gray. And I got there and there were three colors (?) by the front door, and a little scary thing in the back, and those things scared me a little. And I was talking to these girls, and they said that when you went to sleep, you would see ghosts and yellow things and I can't remember exactly; let me think. You would see ghost girls in yellow dresses singing a song. And sure enough, I did. And I wanted to get home because I forgot my bag of clothes and I forgot my lunch box at home. So the next morning they took me home again, and it was a Wednesday morning, and all of a sudden I had to be ready for school."
"A-004"	"#A-004 (1999 (14)) I bought a house for $15,000 for Dad for his birthday. This house had like a pool and a deck and little waterfall things and decks leading into a main house that was just like ours. And we were in the bedroom with some people, I guess they were the former owners. We were talking and eating. They were showing me this thing, the size of five decks of cards that was supposed to be a CD player, and it was like covered with cloth. And we were supposed to be able to play CD's on it and we would hear it without having to connect it to anything. So we were getting ready to play it, and I guess that this unit here was also supposed to be a CD player, and it was a little _smaller, and then we talked about, we were getting ready to make, we were getting ready to have Dad's birthday party in there. But he really liked the house; I was surprised. I didn't think he was going to like the house."
"A-005"	"#A-005 (1999 (14)) There was a rumor that somebody had killed a teacher up on the third floor of the Media Center, and some boys, who were the suspects, were riding the elevator and kind of playing on it for like two hours. And all of a sudden the elevator started making these funny sounds that it had never made before, and I thought, ""Oh boy, the elevator's getting mad."" (laugh) And then I went down to the courtyard in front of the Media Center, and I smelled this toxic chemical, and a boy said that it would make us realize our knowledge of acoustics. And I woke up."
"A-006"	"#A-006 (1999 (14)) Mom and I were cleaning upstairs in our rooms, and that we had an agreement that the first half hour she would put her boom box on and be the DJ, and the second half hour I would put my boom box on and be the DJ. But during her half hour I closed my door, and I wanted so bad to investigate this doll. It was supposed to be this like really super Gidget Gadget paper game. And she was just like a Christmas angel, only she didn't have wings and she didn't move, and stood on a base. And she was a singing doll and she had a volume knob on her base. And somehow I turned it up and I couldn't turn it down, and I was trying to work her gidgets and gadgets, and I couldn't really, I was just, my hands were like stiff as stone. And then all of a sudden I was juxtaposed out into like a rural farm area and I saw these three chickens living in small cages, living in absolute filth. And we bought them just so that we could set them free, and then I woke up."
"A-007"	"#A-007 (1999-05-24 (14)) Mom gave me a __sheet of ten cities _ that we were supposed to fly to. And she had an art thing set up in Albertson's, and it was on a plank floor that I could hardly stand on. And Mom and I and Aunt Kristin were supposed to go to these cities, and so we did. We went to the airport, and we were still walking on that same floor that I could hardly stand on, and we were walking like pigeons on top of this security thing instead of __turning?_____, and we stepped in and walked through the things that the bags go and before we knew it, we were on this people mover car thing that was going 60-70 miles an hour.

"A-008"	"#A-008 (1999-06-01 (14)) Melinda and a few other people and I wanted, we were in this bank, and she had to cash a check, and we were bored waiting for this lady to finish doing her thing. And we convinced them to give us an elevator key so that we could get on it. We got on it and we said, ""I wonder what's up on the tenth floor?"" So we went up to the tenth floor, and this elevator had a blue interior, and we got out -- or we didn't get out -- it was this very dark, closed-in room with light-up stained glass murals on the walls. One was like a map of the world with red continents, another was like something really abstract. So we decided, ""Nah, let's not stay up here. Let's go down to the below-ground level and see what's down there."" And I thought, ""Oh gosh."" I hung onto the railing in the elevator as we descended, almost like a bullet, we hit bottom, and the door opened, and I was expecting it to be as dark as anything, but it was a banquet, luncheon hall and there were people having their lunch in there. And Susan stepped out of the elevator and was going to go spy on them. But then I was up last night, and I had a dream that her and I were with some other people, and oh, she came by to say sorry that she hadn't called me any more, and she wanted to go through a box of jump with me. There were like a box of broken eggs and empty cans and there was a ball and things like that. there was this two-channel mixer that apparently I had gotten for Christmas, and I just ditched when the current one came along but it was in the bedroom, and it could play ___?____ and the bedroom one could only play __?__ which was not true in real life. And so I'm constantly switching back and forth between the two, and then we started going through this stuff. And I thought I saw the CD at the bottom of the box; I thought it was the one that I had been wanting, but it wasn't. It was just some blah CD. And then she and her family and I were at the beach and we were diving in this cave, and they were saying, ""Oh, look at this, oh, look at that."" And it was pitch dark, and so I was feeling around and there were these like huge tarantula things swimming in the water and big sharks with scaly fins. And I was running out of air in my breath, so I had to get out. And I had to take my clothes off for some reason, and then run past everybody and ___run_ in the bathroom so that I could put the clothes on. And Mr. Powell (?) and everybody saw me as I was running past, and they were just shocked. And when I got in the bathroom, I woke up."
"A-009"	"#A-009 (1999/2000 (14)) Mom and I were supposed to go to Jackson and on the last minute our flight was cancelled. And we were running around trying to get our bags, and then we were at the house. And Dad was telling us that he was going to register with the government that he was deceased [laugh] . And then this rescue truck came by and Dad told them to turn on their siren, and they did; they turned on their siren, it was so loud. And then we were riding in it and we got down to the pier area where those cabanas are, and Philip was chasing me around trying to get my elevator key because my elevator key was able to start, he was able to stick it in one of the poles, electrical panels at the top of one of the poles and he would start, turn on a siren with it. So he was trying to get my elevator key. By the way, at school I usually use the elevator so I have a key and I keep it on my wrist. But in my dream he was chasing me around for it, and he didn't know that it was on my wrist. He thought it was in my pocket. And he finally got it, and just before he was able to do anything with it, I woke up. Last night I had a sort of bizarre dream. I had a dream that I was sitting in the car with the engine off. You know how you turn the engine off, but you leave the ignition on so you can still run the secondary circuits? Well, I dreamt that I was sitting in the car with the engine off but the radio on, and it was on 94.9, and we were at a gas station and Mom was filling up the tank. And all of a sudden Dad comes in and sits in the passenger seat and we call on Zach for some reason. I don't know why we called Zach, but we did. And Mom starts the ignition, I mean she starts the engine, and Dad starts -- I don't know -- he starts really falling around, and then Mom starts driving like a crazy woman and saying, ""Zach, Zach, would you please stop!"" Well, she's the one driving like a crazy woman, and we were just about ready to crash and I woke up."
"A-010"	"#A-010 (1999/2000 (14)) I was at school at nighttime, and I was sitting up on the steps that lead up to the third floor. And I was with two other girls, and they were talking about a Christina Aguilera concert that they were going to and I was with them talking about it. And then all of a sudden the alarm system goes off. And we were running, trying to get out of there, we were just trying to get out of there, and then once we were out in the courtyard, it shuts off. And the announcements come on, the intercom system comes on and says that it was just a test, it was just a drill, don't evacuate the building. And then for some reason it goes off again and a few seconds later it shuts off. And then we were just sitting out in the courtyard for a while, and I walked through the place where the cafeteria is. And I felt really heavy over there. I felt like there was way, like four or five times more gravity over there than there is, and I learned that they put submarines down over there and that's why I felt so heavy. And I dreamt that Dad was going to go down in one. And before long, I woke up, thank goodness."

The silvery CD boom box was in the back seat of the car where I was, and we were driving up north and Dad was going to meet us there in a few weeks. And we had our chicken named Loretta in the back seat with us also with a towel covering her. And when we got this to this farm, we took Loretta out and we took the sheet off of her, and she was supposed to go in the gate to the farm, but she just flew for a mile or so, kind of like a vulture would. And then Mom was going to stay and talk to the man at the farm, and I was going to go and walk to a little store. And I don't know where I would have the sense to know where it is or what, but I just started walking. And about three miles away I came to a little store, and I walked in and I sat down at a little counter and there was a little TV there. And Susan said -- my friend Susan, her father -- came in and was showing me a videotape of birds and chickens and things. And then Susan's father started getting all touchy-feely and all, and before long, he was trying to rape me. And I knew not to try and get away because then he would just corner me more and hold me down more. I just screamed as loud as I could, and Susan and her friends all came out from the back of that store and Susan was crying. And before long they held him down so I could get away. And Susan took me to a pay phone, and it was a huge keyboard, and I was trying to call our number, but it wouldn't go through somehow. And then I started walking down the street to head for the farm again, and Mom comes walking up. And then I woke up. "

So we landed again and then we taxied for a while and then we took off again. And then there was an announcement that said we had to land again, so we landed again. And then, while we were taxiing, I went over to see who else was, and Ms. Hollander was on the plane. And I went over, I didn't have time to get back over to my seat before they were going to take off again, so I just sat down next to Ms. H____ in that seat, and we took off again. And then we had to land again, so we landed again. And I guess my subconscious said, ""Okay, enough of that business,"" and then I woke up."
"A-014"	"#A-014 (1999/2000 (14)) I was at Six Flags, but it was really a college campus. But the weird thing about this was, it was like a continuation of a dream that I had last week. Last week I dreamt that I was at Six Flags, but it was really a college campus and I wanted to go on this water ride. And I was with Melinda, and we were going up an elevator to get to it, but the elevator door didn't close, and I was standing at the edge and it was going up, and I almost fell off because the door didn't close. And then when we got up to the place where the seats were, it was like this roller coaster, and we started to move forward and my strap thingy didn't lock in place and I felt like I was going to fall out. And then I woke up. And last night I dreamt that I was at Six Flags, but it was really a college campus, but instead, I dreamt that I was with Hayleigh and Kendra and Susan and that we were at the table eating a lunch. We were at like a little table, and I swore to myself I was going to ride the Montu_ before we left, but first I wanted to go on this water ride. And I went up with Melinda and Kendra and Susan on a really fancy elevator this time. It had like a crystal door to it, and the little thingy that you activate it with that was a crystal key. And then when we got inside, it had a white floor and it was like really fancy and high class looking inside. The panel was very sleek; it wasn't ""blah"" like most of them are. And we rode up four floors on it, and then we had to get off and get on another elevator and ride up four more floors. This elevator had a dark floor and it was still very formal and very classy looking. We rode up four more floors on that one. And then we crossed the hall, we got on another elevator that was kind of average. It had a dark floor. We rode up two floors on that one. And when we got off, we were on the roof. And we got into these seats that were like water ride rafts and we started paddling out. And then I jumped out of mine and I started swimming around, and I swam in this little ____ thing. Then I grabbed onto it again and I swam back to shore, kind of back to shore with it. And then I had to take my wet bathing suit off and wrap myself in a towel and I walked around like that for a while. We kind of walked through the, got back on the elevator and rode down a floor, and were walking around in different halls and things, and we went into somebody's dorm room and it was so messy. And then I realized it was somebody's private space, and I turned around and I rode down the elevator, the fancy white high-class one, and we came out in the lobby, and we were going to the principal's office to get me some dry clothes. And she put up a big fuss about how we weren't supposed to walk around wrapped in a towel 45 minutes after we got off the ride. And I was trying to tell her that I just now got off of it, and then I woke up. Last night I had a dream that we lived in an apartment, that our house was like a unit in an apartment complex, and that the apartment complex had just gotten a new alarm system installed. I don't remember if it was a fire alarm system or a security alarm system, but it was something. And I dream that we couldn't have Archie any more because his fast movements would activate the system all the time. So instead I had eight small cockatiels in a cage and they were all fluttering and flying around, and two of them got away somehow. And I was looking for them and looking for them in the kitchen table, and I started moving too fast, and I activated it. And then I dreamt that Mrs. Gammons, my old Gifted teacher, was standing in our kitchen, and she was talking about my gifted first grade, my grades when I was her student in first grade. "

We were hiking down by some lake area, and we were trying to get back to the Visitor Center and we thought we would have to go through a cave and swim to get back to the Visitor Center. And I came in wearing a dress. So we found a shorter route that was only a mile, and we got back to the Visitor Center and I kind of lost everybody, so I figured I would stand by the door in the Visitor Center and they would find me eventually. And they did. Samantha and Sandra came out, pushing this gingerbread house that was so big it had to be pushed along on wheels, and it was designed to be eaten on the trail ______ a snack. So Samantha and Sandra and I only wanted to hike one more mile and Dad and Derek and Mom wanted to go ten more miles. So Samantha and Sandra and I took the short trail and we said we would meet back at the Visitor Center. So Samantha and Sandra and I started off hiking, pushing this gingerbread house that was on wheels, it was so big. And we were eating little cookies and little candies and little nutty things off of it, and was getting top-heavy on the one side, so we had to lay it down.

But anyway, there was a woman at a sound board, and the board wasn't black. It was kind of a light burnt sienna brown with the knobs and things were black. And she wanted me to come over and help her, and she showed me where the power switch was. But she wanted me to find a video input key, and I was looking all over the schematic for it and I didn't see it anywhere. And meanwhile, while I was looking over the schematic for the video input key, she was mopping up and cleaning up the reception hall. And she was sweeping the floor and things.

And we had a movie on pause while we were doing all of this. And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main building looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Richards and Ms. Salazar and we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody's class, and then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot, in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Kendra that was sitting at the sound board and her and I would talk. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things. And that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends, and I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes. And I would get all nervous and jerky when I would see one. [Continued on side 2. I had a dream on the other side of this tape that got cut off. It was about, let's see, I dreamt that dream that got cut off, but the other one, I don't.] Dad and I were testing out the portable two-way radios to see if they work, because I can't remember if it was Carol or some other person, or Josie, somebody coming. And we were going to go to the beach with them and we wanted to keep track of them. So we were like testing them out. And the one that I had turned into a cell phone and called somebody's phone number, and we kind of like interrupted them during supper. And then, as we were trying to figure something out, it turned into this like computer keyboard desktop tape recorder type of thing. We were going through and listening to past transmissions and past conversations that it had saved. And this is really a watered-down version, man, this is dumb.

So we got back there and there was a rope fence partitioning off this spot of ground where they were going to put the equipment. And there were a whole bunch of chairs set up, but there was no band and no sound tech, so we kept walking around for a while. And then we got back, we decided to go back and see if they were set up, and I saw this guy sitting in the spot where the board was supposed to be with the radio, and he said, ""They're not going to have a band today.

So we decided that we would go in the back gate, and go up the back elevator, which was just like the one that we don't like. But then we decided we didn't have to go up there because it wasn't up there. But and then we went into the Warrior Vision Studio where a bunch of people were, and I was singing in front of the sound board in there, and I leaned my watch up against the ledge and it made a funny beep and a male voice said, ""Hi, Chalise, we have to get out of here."" And something about the humidity is way too high and the fumes are way too high. And I thought, ""That is really weird."" It was a male voice, so I told Melinda, ""Come on, let's get out of here before anything else happens."" And we started, we crossed, I was holding her hand tight like I do Mom's, but I was holding her hand tight for some reason, and we were crossing several streets and then we were walking through a garden. And two spare tires were laying kind of by the side there, and there was a crate like there is out in the garage and a couple of pots and we had to get through this thorny plant. We had to step up on this ledge. And then I woke up."

And I wanted to see if it actually works. So one time, Dad was still teaching CPR in my dream. While Dad was at a CPR class, I took our old one out and put this one in and wired it all up, and it worked. It kind of had funny sound to it though. And then I took it out and put ours back in, but I only had time to put the front left speaker wire in and I had to slide the cabinet back real quick because he was coming home. And so then I was putting it in its box and set it in the dining room. And another time, when nobody was around, I went to go look at it. It had turned to solid chocolate. [laugh] And then Mom was driving me and a couple other friends to a chorus concert in the car and Dad had to go to another CPR class, so we let him off at the park. And then when we got home, I went to check on it again, and the solid chocolate had turned into white chocolate with little marshmallows in it, and I took a bite of it and said, ""Hmm, I think I've had enough for a week.""

And then Mom wanted to go to Seven Eleven with me, and she was mumbling to her self, ""Bars, bars, bars -- all we ever go to is bars."" And then I woke up. "

And she had to stop at the store and get this tube thing. It was like a hose with a funnel at one end and a little bag at the other end. [laugh] And in order to do the surgery, they needed parts from my portable CD player, and for some reason I found it in the bathroom with a cane attached to the handle leading into the toilet. And I was like, ""Oh, my gosh."" I turned it on to see if it would still work and it was dark in the bathroom, and the LEDs, the liquid crystal display doesn't usually light up, but this time it lit up like LEDs.

And Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were on a convertible riding next to us. And I had my portable CD player packed in a bag, and then Dad stops the picnic table and went into the bathroom, and I put the unit on real quick so that nobody would see it. And then we kept on going until we saw my Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry, and all of a sudden we were at this huge English palace mansion thing, and I was going to ask Uncle Larry how his 5.1 system is coming along, when I realized that Uncle Larry was a police officer now. And he was singing a song to me about how he really cared for me, and he had a bunch of his other officer friends close by. And for some reason I was kind of apathetic and he was really hurt, and he wanted me to recite this poem. And I started crying. And he thought that maybe I just didn't like officers or something, and I was trying to tell him about some good experiences that I've had, like with Mr. Harris. And then all of a sudden this girl with this English accent comes by and starts talking to me and wants me to bow and say hello to these people dressed up like porcelain dolls who are supposed to be English royalty. And then she asks, ""Can you play the organ?"" And I said, ""I know a few bars or something, but I'm not really sure."" So we went out into this big, vast room with columns and things, with an organ in it. And this maid person comes out and says, ""Don't disturb them, because Uncle Larry and his officer friends were having a conference in the other room. And so I started to play what I thought I knew, but none of the keys would make any sound, and then the girl told me that we needed to put a new set of keys in. And they were all paper, and I was like playing these paper, white paper strips in a box, and these were supposed to be the keys. And then I woke up."
"A-035"	"#A-035 (2000/2001 (15)) About two weeks I had a dream that I was at school and I was with my Mom and we were headed to the bus but I had to use the bathroom first. And the bathroom in the building on the first floor had this thing in most of the stalls where it would have an infrared beam of light coming down from the ceiling, and when you would go in, it wouldn't do anything; but when you would come out, it would activate this two-tone back-up alarm sound that would just fill the whole bathroom. And I was so afraid to go in there because of that. And I finally went in, and nothing happened."

And then I dreamt that I was like at this parade, and they were shooting off planes that had engines of certain sound frequency ranges. And I was looking at this chart to see which one they were, depending on what kind of frequency ranges they had. Then I was snooping around somebody's back yard, and I was naked, and I stepped in some sand spurs and I got a whole foot full of them. And the lady came out and she was real nice. She put some kind of peroxide on them and just made them not hurt any more and made them fall right out. And I came in, and the lady was showing me her CD burner and told me her husband is really good with it. And I put something in the left-hand tray and finalized it, and when I got home, I found out that the lady's husband was at home looking at our CD burner. And then I kind of woke up."

They've been slipping away from me as soon as I gain consciousness for some reason. But the other night I had a dream that I was at this run-down house -- kind of like Aunt Kristin's house -- and we heard this band playing. And Christina and I were walking around, and we were going to try to record this thing, and it was playing in one of those portable classroom-like things. And we were walking around to get the best vantage point because she wanted to record it. And we even stepped inside and realized that it was much quieter in there, because their amplifier was, they had the wires like under the door and everything outside so that we could hear them. And it looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner, only without the hose. [laugh] And then I was listening to a tape that was supposed to have some oldies on it, but instead it had some bluebird songs and some oldies. And I dreamt that Christina and I -- it was dark by then -- we were walking and she gave me three numbers. One was 898-2956, the usual one. The other one was one that she had gotten for her birthday, but she got it taken away because she violated her curfew. And then the third one was another one that she got."

It looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner without the hose. And last night's dream was full of red things. I don't remember, I have no recollection as to what happened, but I remember walking in a red house and seeing red things, and having a little toy house that was red."
"B-003"	"#B-003 (2001-06-12 (16)) This is the morning after. I have to record this dream before it slips away. It is now firmly implanted in my head. First I dreamt that Josie and Marilyn and Dad and I were staying in a hotel, and I confronted Dad about canceling the Buxton House in the spring, and he actually felt bad about it. And he took us to this -- right when I confronted him, he was wearing this robe like judges wear -- and then we went to this park called Cumidy (sp?) Inn Park. And it was out towards Miramonte, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Miramonte. And when we got there, we didn't have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn't terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam -- I swam right behind Dad, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him [laugh] , and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn't swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer [laugh] . How can you mix without a mixer? But anyway, after that I was just glad I could get down out of there, and Mom was saying she had to clean that pool area pretty soon. And then I woke up."

And I must have been in there for an hour in the dream, and Dad comes in and says, ""Time to shut it off now."" And he clothes it in a weird meaning. He says that the CD burner is a p__peeing??_ unit because it's going and recording in the same way that we go pee. I woke up at 1:30 in the morning and I was kind of scared, but I had to go pee. Maybe that's why I dreamt that."

And when I opened the box, I saw that she was just like a regular Barbie Doll on top, but she had, she had like a thing without a tail. She had no legs. And apparently that was the sound thing for her. And then, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park. Anyway, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park, and she was singing louder than anything without a microphone.. This pen is driving me insane. She was singing as loud as she could without an amplifier, and it was just like that she had one. And then I walked in to her hotel room and I saw her and her kids kind of peeking around in there. And I got to see the outfit that she was going to wear to the concert, and I got to talk to her, and her voice was quiet, just like Sandra's voice. Anyway, I dreamt that me and Melinda's family ran into her family and just talked. And then I woke up."

The real song goes, ""Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!"" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, ""Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done."" I can't explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Six Flags or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn't because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn't go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn't even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn't have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody's key is - oh, what's the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, ""I have never noticed that,"" and she said, ""That's because you're never sick."""

And he said that that was going to be storing it until next year. And as soon as he left, I would take it out and put it back on the desk. And I had to return a book to Mrs. Talmadge, but I was too afraid to go up to her, and I don't think I ever returned it before I woke up. Last night I had a very peculiar dream. First of all I dreamt that we were near a sea wall at the waterfront, and everybody wanted me to scuba dive. They said that if I wanted to stay down there for three weeks, I was going to need scuba gear [laugh] . And also I dreamt that Tweety was this paper Styrofoam bird with paper wings and a napkin folded and all for her tail. And she was really a listening device so that I could monitor what people were saying on the phone. And there was also these two other birds, Archie, my cockatiel and then there was this white bird -- very delicate with a plume -- and wings that were raised up. And then both of those birds were kind of in cahoots with the Styrofoam Tweety somehow, and the wings of the other white bird also stayed up for some reason. Then I also dreamt that I was sitting on the steps with my feet towards the up of the steps, and I was trying to get the mini-cassette to work, and the terminals were like way loose, and it wasn't really cooperating. There was this big cardboard box ____??_______. And then Dad comes up the steps. Anyway, this tape is really squeaky now. And then Dad comes up the stairs and says that it's my problem.

People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they'd lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass.

We were walking around these gardens and things and it was all supposedly a city of Salamanca, but there were no real buildings besides her house.

But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody's Fox 13 truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn't a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker.

One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went ""drive, park, reverse"" and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn't the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn't have any of that on the side. In real life it was just hunky dory, but it had bad sound."
"B-019"	"#B-019 (2001-08-14 (16)) Okay, I had a dream that I was at this place, I was with this group. I must have still been in Spain because we were speaking Spanish sometimes. I'm kind of stuck on that. [laugh] And we were going to see somebody ice skating or rollerblading or doing some kind of tricks like that. And we were on rollerblades ourselves, and we were hurrying up to this place. And then we jumped on these escalators that go twice as fast as regular ones do. And so then they started, we like jumped on these escalators and they go really fast up, and then we arrived at the top and there was this ramp. And I couldn't stop my, I sat down on the edge of the ramp and I couldn't stop my feet from rolling down into the ramp. They were like hanging off into the middle of the floor there. And then I think I had another dream. I think we were there too early so we couldn't see the show then. Then I had another dream that I was at dinner and we were eating, eating, eating these things. I had just finished a course, and already this Spanish guy was serving me these things. He had a tray with like six compartments and he had to take these two spoonfuls ... [tape not working] . This is a horrible tape! "

And somebody was showing me mine from last year and I couldn't really read it. It was like diagrammed out, though. And then we were watching some kind of a movie, and then Melinda came and looked at me and said, ""Let's go."" And then I'm riding in a brown car with her, with brown seats in it. And we go to this restaurant and we're ordering this steak burger thing and all of a sudden she disappears, she takes off. And then I woke up."
"B-021"	"#B-021 (2001-08-20 (16)) Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, and that Ryan was over, and we were all sitting in the living room with Dad and talking about something; I don't remember exactly what. I seem to recall having a similar dream before. And Dad was sleeping and Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I were all out at the park, and I was carrying the silvery portable boom box down, and I was going to put it somewhere. And I was sitting on the couch with it, and I was playing a tape of sound effects that I recorded. And then I remembered that Dad was sleeping and I figured I'd better take it back upstairs. And then I said to Mom, ""I'm getting my exercise hauling this thing up and down the stairs."" And then all of a sudden I was under the water with a plastic bag [laugh] and supposedly I could hear Sebastian and Ursula's eels, and then I woke up."
"B-022"	"#B-022 (2001-08-22 (16)) I discovered this tape (Wee Sing tape), that we were at a little house that we were staying with Mrs. Hollander in and two other students, and I discovered this tape that I just described. And I put it in a boom box, and I started playing it, and it had ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and a couple of other patriotic songs on it, but it was totally different than what I just described it to be. That was strange."
"B-023"	"#B-023 (2001-08-23 (16)) This was the day after my first day of school. I dreamt that Dad was kind of crabby and that he was in Mom's workroom and I whispered to Mom something or other and somehow he heard it. And somehow he heard it and then he came in and started disconnecting the wires to my sound system, and I said, ""What are you doing?"" and then he made some kind of smart alec remarks and he said, ""I'm not worth anything to you."" And then I said, ""Well, think of all our walk time, all our family time."" And he said, ""Family time? Yech!"" And then I said something, I yelled something and then I slammed the door behind me and I ran out with Mom to go to the Thai restaurant with the firemen people. I think this dream was brought on be a subconscious overreaction to his teasing last night about I didn't use his binder and so he was teasing about he's just an old bird these days. Now I remember something else about that dream. After Mom and I walked out, we went to Circuit City and I think she was tell me she dropped something, and she was going to have to pay for it. I don't remember exactly. "
"B-024"	"#B-024 (2001-08-27 (16)) First of all, we were on the nature trail and we were walking along looking at different things -- Mom and me and my sisters, Samantha and Sandra, and Derek. And we were showing pictures in the picture album; we took a few more pictures. And then we came home, we stopped on the way home at like a big service merchandise store thing. And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I'd done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn't even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then Dad was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on. And then I was with Brad and Randy and Mark from Home Improvement, trying to make them work something out, and showing them our family pictures. And then I woke up."

We had Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and Grandma and Grandpa, and Grandpa was doing the passing. And Uncle Carl and Vince and Uncle Charlie were all little boys, and it was like it used to be. Carl got all kinds of nice things and the other two were real jealous. And before I knew it, somehow -- I don't remember unless we changed scenes -- like we were our family and we had all these little things in front of us, and then Dad said, ""I'm going to bring the presents out in a little bit,"" thinking that it was the big one. And I also dreamt that the magnifying machine in the dining room was a computer and that it was on and I had to hit control-alt-delete because something went really screwy, and then I remembered, and then I woke up."

And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she couldn't find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn't turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Warrior Vision room with Melinda and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and Mrs. Talmadge sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Melinda is teasing and she says ""Yeah, that's Jasmine, messing up your room in there."" And then we go out a back door and we're in this field thing, and then I'm with Mom, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I'm tired; can you tell? [sigh] There were these kids around and so I can't. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I'm in this church and I'm auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Hanover. And they give me a song that's completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff.

And it was a little different than the usual story really is because, first of all, there were only a few events in it. Eric and her had a few more dates before they got married, and King Triton was never in the scene. And she stayed a mermaid while she was up on land with him. It was just so weird, so strange, so different. And after the movie was over, I woke up."

And I got on the bus and I realized that I didn't have any shoes on, but then I looked down and I saw my sandals, so I put my sandals on. And I got to school and I was walking in the hallway and it was almost dark, and I realized that they were going to not like me wearing my sandals, so I was going to call Mom on the pay phone to bring them and to give me my other shoes. And I just thought about them and they were on my feet and I didn't have to call Mom after all. Later we walked out to the football field and it was real cold and there were several little fires going. And there was one that was almost burned down, and I put my hand in the embers to get a little statue of a parrot out of there, and it didn't burn me at all, it only tingled a little bit so I figured I'd better get away from here before the teacher sees me sticking my hand in the fire. And then, after I pulled the statue of the parrot out, it started burning big again, and Mrs. Hollander and Mrs. Dougherty and I sat down on the bench in front of it to keep us warm, because it was cold. And Mrs. Dougherty's voice was getting lower and lower, and I was really afraid that she had been hurting it yelling at the class, which she never did."

And Melinda was in the hospital. I think she was either in the hospital or visiting me. But there were two rooms that we got to roam around, and one of them was my room and it was like all messed up with other people's junk. And I don't remember if it had one or not, but the other room had a radio that was kind of falling apart, and it was turned on and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. It had a CD player top thing to it, but the lid came off. [laugh] And things were just all falling apart on it. And eventually I got it to shut off somehow. And then I was talking to her about what would we do if we ever had a fire drill in here, and then this message came over the intercom that they were going to have one. But here's the funny thing: the funny thing is that the fire alarm sound was going to be like frog's croaking, and that was how there were frogs croaking outside when I woke up."

And later I dreamt that I was at school in Mrs. Hollander's room and we were doing something, and I had to put my book bag somewhere, so I went in the auditorium and I put my book bag down. And the auditorium had no seats in it; it was just a big room. And then I heard Mr. Vaccaro's class coming and I went in the closet and closed the door. I didn't want him to see me. And then I figured it was just his students and it was safe to come out. Then I came out and got out and told Melinda that I had wet in the closet. And then I dreamt that I was in my room, in my bedroom with somebody -- two other girls -- and I was playing a destiny's Child CD, but somehow we could see them singing and performing.

"B-033"	"#B-033 (2001-09-16 (16)) The morning when Mom and Dad are supposed to leave town. It's 5:30 this morning, so I sound a little distant. Last time I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty was in Spanish class, and that she was going to teach us to sing ""The Star Spangled Banner,"" which was very appropriate. And Mrs. Dougherty comes over and sits besides me, and she said that she saw me in AP Spanish, which I really am not but in my dream I was, and that I should translate ""The Star Spangled Banner"" into Spanish while they were doing a staff writing sheet so that I could get some AP credit. And so I started in, and I can recall that I did it perfectly. I started with the first line, ""Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver"" (sp??) and I was having a little trouble fitting, ""by the dawn's early light, con la loof temprana de amanese (sp???)"" into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Melinda driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don't remember for sure what that was about. One other thing about this dream that I had, when I was translating ""The Star Spangled Banner"" and I could hear Whitney Houston singing it in my head, I started crying a little bit because I had such sympathy for my country and all, in my dream, of course. But I still had a tear in my eye when Mrs. Dougherty came over to talk to me again, and she thought that I was disappointed because everybody else got to hear it and I didn't. [laugh] Oh, it was funny!"

And then I came back in because I knew I had left them in the dust and I didn't want to leave them in the dust, so I came back in. I bumped face to face into Mrs. Talmadge, and she started telling me how, she was like, ""Melinda told me your father's back-up alarm scared you when you were little, and I understand you're afraid of 'oo' sounds and my name has 'oo' in it."" [laugh] You know, I never thought about that consciously. That's weird. Ooo-oo-ooh. But anyway, then when we were at the fire headquarters, and I was supposedly playing a computer game in virtual reality and I was running up the stairs with this like three-quarters of a birdcage that I was holding onto. And it was around my body and I was like holding it up. And I bump into Sharon and George, and they start saying, ""Oh hey, how are ya? And how'd you like the trip up to the river, and all?""

And I asked Mrs. Talmadge, ""Where is it this year?"" and she handed me a set of keys and led me down this set of stairs in like a cellar in the Bell Building. And then before I knew it, the steps led to outside. And she lifted this cover off the ground and showed us a little panel about twelve inches long and about six inches wide with just two or three knobs on it and said, ""This is our panel. This is what we use. This is the extent of our equipment now."" And she lifted another cover and there were these mint candies in that cover, and I took a handful.

And I was sitting on the floor of my room cutting it up and putting plates of cake on the steps for everybody. And Gerard got one with a parrot and a dolphin, and Mrs. Dougherty got one with a big bear, and she said, ""Make sure I get a plate with french fries."" And so I piled all the french fries to hers. And then we were walking in this restaurant, from table to table holding hands and singing. And we climbed up on this one table and were singing. And my voice was louder and more resonant than anybody else's.

But he was telling all these horror stories as to what could happen in an elevator, and how you could like fall ten stories. I was really nervous when we got on the elevator and went down to the ground floor, but we did. And then he wanted me to ride around the perimeter of this garden. First there was a little place where people could go in with a fan blowing out of it, then there was a little pool, then there was the air conditioner and then there was the other side opposite the house.

And after she had Aquada (the eldest mermaid in the movie), Triton took her to the, some meeting somewhere to kind of show her how things were done. And she was talking to like a teenager. And then the scary part was when she had Ariel and Triton had Ariel and they came to the part of the movie where he destroyed her human treasures. Instead of singing ""Part of That World,"" she sang ""Bluebird."" And then the movie ended. And I, oh my gosh. And once Mom was up in my room and there was this dinosaur soap that had broken in half and we called it a bluebird soap, and it wasn't really scary. And then I differentiated between the bluebird tape and the bluebird soap. [laugh] That was kind of funny actually. And then she put on this really pretty dress and decided she was going to go to the store, and I told her, ""Well, wait a minute. How in the world am I going to do this without you?"" because I was getting ready to record something, I don't remember what. And she said, ""We'll do it as soon as I get back,"" and I was like, ""Yeah, right."" And then the scariest part.

And next thing I knew, I was down at the sea wall of Oceanside and I was standing on the little ledge down below where we used to jump off of, and there was a boom box on top of the sea wall. And I was getting ready to jump into the water. When I turned around, and I turned the volume of the boom box down some first, and then I jumped in the water and there was this inflatable ionic column floating around in the water that I grabbed hold of, and then I was swimming around and somebody was saying how the main thing in the movie is volume and how to visit their website and all."

Ms. Dougherty was in this big, white tee shirt with white pants. I've never seen her in all white before, but in my dream she was. And another dream I had last night, I dreamt that we were having some kind of a party in the kitchen and Uncle Larry rode up on Mom's bicycle with his boom box in the basket, blasting.

And then we started going faster and faster, and I thought to myself how the words were tripping over each other, and how it got to be tongue twister when we started going faster and faster. And we got to, ""Fa la la, la la la, la la la,"" I had to go into my own octave, and that happened to be when Mrs. Dougherty was standing right next to me.

She said, ""This is good exercise."" And then she, with her other arm, puts her other around me and starts spinning us around and around and around, and then we start just walking again and she yells something, something like, ""Didn't That feel good?"" and I say, ""Easy, won't that hurt your voice?"" And she didn't answer. So we kept walking and before we knew it, we were home.

And then I got home and Mom was there, and then I called her and left a message that Mom was already here. I don't remember what happened after that."
"B-046"	"#B-046 (2001-10-25 (16)) I remember a little piece of a dream I had last night. I dreamt that, I keep having dreams about chorus and Mrs. Dougherty lately -- what is the deal with me? Anyway, I dreamt that I was going to make a -- hold on -- I dreamt that I was going to make a compilation CD with all of our songs on it, all of our accompaniment. And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like 9:30 at night, and I figured I'd better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department. And Mr. Vaccaro answered, and I was really a befuddled buffoon as to what to say. I thought at least Mr. Hanover would answer. And then I woke up."
"B-047"	"#B-047 (2001-10-28 (16)) Dad bought me this mixer thing, meaning a cake mixer, not a sound mixer. And it was this round ball thing with a handle on it that you would mix around in this big vat container, and this motor would run and make a vat container for some reason. And he brought me this set of stuff because he thought I would like to mix up concoctions and things. And, oh yeah, I was standing at the kitchen counter mixing some chocolate batter and all the food was on top and all the bits of chocolate were on the bottom, and I tipped the container over when I was mixing it, and the motor was running underneath the container, I guess keeping it warm or something. And I dropped the mixer ball and it somehow goes down the drain and the motor starts doing funny things. And I told Dad and he called the company, hoping they can come out here and take it out, but there was still another mixer ball, but it wouldn't work if the other one was stuck in the drain. [laugh] That was bizarre. "
"B-048"	"#B-048 (2001-10-28 (16)) We were in the hotel that was being evacuated, being moved out, and we had a room on the second floor. And Dad was off doing something, and Mom and I -- I'm cold, hold on. It's October the 28th and winter's setting in. Okay, but anyway, Dad was off doing something and it was Mom and I, and we were coming down in an orderly fashion out of the hotel and standing in the parking lot without a bag or anything. And we saw a separate building with an elevator in it next door, and we thought about going up the elevator to get all the way to the top, to the sixth floor, but we never did. And oh yeah, now the first dream came to me all of a sudden. I dreamt that we were coming home in Melinda's Mustang, her and I, and I was sitting in the back with my book bag because on the bus I sit right behind the driver, so I sat with my book bag in the back. And I don't remember her having the sound system or anything on, but she said she wanted me to sit in the back because I was so heavy. I don't remember; I'm sure there was more to it, but I can't remember. [laugh]"

And then I woke up with a start."

And I was with a girl, Laura, and she was helping me get my lunch and stuff, after I finished eating, Dad was showing me this metal board with stuff on it that was supposed to make scary sounds like, for example, there was this little truck that rides on the metal board. And when it goes forward, it doesn't do anything, but when it goes backwards, it makes the back-up alarm sound. And there were these ambulances things and stuff that would ride around the perimeter, and then Ms. Dougherty was busy running around doing things. But then we were in our kitchen and Dad was questioning Mrs. Dougherty about the way she teaches, and she's defending herself. And Mom says, ""Why does it matter, who cares?"" And he said, ""Well, even better if people are trying to contribute,"" and he goes in the bedroom, and her grade book happens to be sitting on the bed in the bedroom. And he looks through her grade book and he sees that she does actually have an orderly way of keeping things. And there's these CD's, these really flimsy CD's that are bigger than normal CD's that are running there and then we go around and we do different things, and we were talking about going to this restaurant, and then it's dark and we're on our porch and Mrs. Dougherty suddenly appears there, and she was talking about how she was thinking of doing this certain song. And I told her about the bluebird thing and I held her hand and I sang ""Bluebird"" for her and then I woke up."

It was kind of junky, but it was alright, I guess. And one time I started it up and drove it down to the end of the alley and turned around and drove back. And another time I started it up and went to 7-Eleven, and then I left it in the 7-Eleven parking lot and I was walking around and I took a walk around the lake and as I was walking home from the lake, something strange happened. Oh no, I think I got home from the park first. This guy came to the door with this dog, which he called Squirrely and I just got this terrible feeling in his presence, I thought, ""Ooohhhhhhh,"" so I went in the house, but he came on the porch. And I went in the kitchen, but he came there. Then I took off out the back door and down the alley, and he like chased me around the neighborhood and then I got into the house and he was gone; thank goodness. Then I woke up."

But I knew I, we got to fourth period where we got to see Mrs. Talmadge and I was really nervous and all, and we got there and we just talked like normal people do, and before I knew it, we were in a gift shop together looking at things and talking like normal people. And she bought me this sheep pin. I think that this dream occurred because when I was listening to the tape with Grammy on it, she kind of, sort of, remotely sounded similar to Mrs. Talmadge."

And we had two cars, looked exactly alike. One of them had a couple little things that were here and there, and one that was perfect. And then we had two clock radios. The one that was there was, it wouldn't display the time any more, but the display would show like little flowers and things instead of the numbers for the time. And it was showing like stuff like a sailing boy would show, and I had to click the parrot thing to tell the time. But we had another good one that was ready to go. I don't know what all this double imagery means, but a couple years ago I had a dream that there were two Tweety's and, even more, I had a dream that there were two of Dad.

[blows nose] Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt had moved to a new place and it was a big, huge place in northern New York, kind of an old rural area. And they had this big living room that they were going to have a Christmas party in. It was like half the size of the Coliseum. It was like the banquet hall at the Wyndham Hotel where we had our Spanish conference banquet and dance in. There were three Christmas trees at this widthwise end. [blows nose] , and I asked Mom to show me how to turn them on, turn the lights on, and she said they weren't even decorated yet.

We were having a picnic, a picnic with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and Quinn, and Clark and Marilou were there too. And we were all sitting around, and I was sitting far away at first, but then I heard where they all were and I came with the left-over bowl and joined them. And I thought that they were singing the Westport High School alma mater, but that was some other group of people.

And so I took it and I held the knob and I kind of clicked it back into place, and then it was okay for a while.

And I was walking around the ship with Ms. Garland and some other people and all of a sudden we were out on the deck singing Christmas carols. And Ms. Garland kind of turned into Mrs. Dougherty and she was leading us in song, and then I realized that we weren't on a ship but we were in a building and I was singing with the group in this building. And then I went into this office and I started speaking Spanish to Lydia, who is the promotion lady at the radio station. The only thing I can think why I dream about Lydia is because I was going to intern there, but now I find out they don't take anybody unless they're 18, and I took it pretty hard. So I think I'm going to have another dream about her tonight."

And then we saw somebody come up behind us and start shooting. And somebody was accusing us of doing that.

And so I went upstairs to get my sound system set up, get the mixer ready to take the keyboard and mix it with my voice. And I, for some reason the CD burner was sitting on my chair. And then I realized that there were two of them; there was one in its normal position and one that was sitting on my chair. And I was supposed to put it on top of the tape player, which is to my right when I'm sitting at my desk, and the amplifier and CD burner are to my left. And I was supposed to put the second CD burner on top of this tape player, and there was also this extra external CD player that would feed stuff into the mixer for me that I had to, and so I was stacking up all these units and then I turned the light off and I sit down and I turn on my amplifier, and the amplifier is just this massive, this massive receiver like I see in Sound & Vision and it's got this fluorescent display that these wild colors that change color with the tone that I hear. And it had a tape deck built right into it. I was like, ""Wow!"" And I exploring all these different functions, and I was listening to a Kenny Rogers tape in it and it sounded pretty good. It didn't sound as good as my other tape player though for some odd reason. And if I was listening to this tape and watching the display fluorescently change and the indicators flash, I slowly faded into consciousness and my radio came on and startled me awake. I never did get set up to jam with Melinda, which she really doesn't play the keyboard. I was just dreaming that."

And Mom and I were talking about eating lunch in the lobby, and then we continued on home and my house had been renovated. There was a bed in the dining room with a tape player just sitting on top of it, and where the monitor is there was a shelf full of books and I was thinking, ""How strange is that!"" And it was an old-fashioned antique bed and I called it the dench beds. [laugh] And last night I had a kind of a hodge podge dream. First I had a really kind of scary dream that I was with this girl, this other teenager, in this house and we were eating these candies, and first she gave me this one candy that was out of a pot of, you know, she just made it and she gave it to me. And it was so good. But then we went in this other room and there was a big accordion-shape candy, and just being near it made me short of breath, and I couldn't breathe very well. And she gave me a piece and I was almost ready to pass out and I ran out of the room. And then I woke up. Gee, I don't know. Oh, and then I had another little dream that night that Canada and Russia were going to war for some reason, and we were going to get inside of Canada.

And Mom got it for me, and I was thinking to myself, surprising Mom by learning to play, but I was thinking how this Celine Dion keyboard was brown and it angled kind of slightly up like the mixer. And it was really strange because it had this stand-alone amplifier with an internal speaker, and I used a like speaker wire to connect it. I was sitting on the stairs with this keyboard on my lap and I connected it to this amplifier with speaker wire and I was going to play, and I was going to surprise people. And things kept happening and I never got to. I think they were going to the beach and walking along the beach and I was telling people that I was going to do it. Then I woke up.

And so I was in my little dinghy and I kept tipping it over like a canoe, and by the time I knew it, I was floating on top of it. And then all of a sudden we were at home, and Mom and I were blasting the sound system waiting for Dad and the fire people to come over and join the party.

And they had to wrap around the front seat and go in the back seat so that they could be for two passengers. And all of this looked really scary, and I noticed that this car had something in it that most race cars don't have, which is in the audio system. And then we were looking around at some other different rides and seeing how wild they were, and we figured, ""Hey, let's go on this conveyor belt through this place."" And it was like a building with a couple of different things in it. And we went, we jumped on the conveyor belt and we saw this monster just running across it. I started running too and I couldn't figure out why we were running. And then we were at this show watching the Little Mermaid swim around this fish aquarium tank.

And soon after Flounder from the Little Mermaid was coming up to our blanket like a pigeon and he had claws like a bird and he perched on my hand for a little bit. And then he jumped back into the water and I jumped in with him and I swam around for a little bit. And then getting out was like no challenge at all. The water was like a few feet down from the sea wall and after that we were going to meet Mom at this far thing like Disneyland and there was this playground that we were going on and I was supposed to have a tape machine, because I was going to record all the noise and sounds and everything from the fair, but I guess I left it at the picnic area. It was really Mom's boom box and we were going to go see Mom on this playground. And we did and I found her sitting on the bottom of this like walk-in bird cage, and we started talking about different things, and we planned to go to this like show with elephants or something. But I woke up before we got there. That was weird! But I think it has a lot of roots of my past.

And then she looked out the window, and said, ""We'd better go. There's a big, black cloud of thunder,"" and it was raining out there. So we started out, and all of a sudden we were crossing the courtyard at school and these big claps of thunder were coming closer and closer, and I was like, I fell and then I was like crawling, and I got inside the building and there were like tons of people in there.

And I was looking around for a place to sit -- it was a really big bus -- and I picked a seat kind of in the middle. And I put my bags down; it was my usual school bag, bag. And every time the bus had to turn, it had to use that back-up alarm sound, that two-tone back-up alarm sound. And there were two buses that were going on this trip. The one was the bus that I was riding and the other was another bus with a group. And this driver of this bus was so careless, when the bus needed to turn and had to use that back-up alarm, and it would turn in front of the other one and it would run it so close, it like scraped the front of the other one a few times.

But instead of an awards ceremony, it was a movie, and the movie already started. And the seats were like way slanted, and so I had to really climb to get to the top and this alarm thing kept going off because I was blocking the projector thing. It wouldn't go off if I stood up in the aisle, but it went off when I was climbing over the seats that were on a deep incline.

First, let's see, I was at school and I was missing Mrs. Hollander's class, first because I got lost in the hallway, second of all because Melinda and Mrs. Hildebrand stopped me and were talking, and then I took my clothes off and was taking a bath in the school bathroom. And then I was trying to figure out how to get back to Mrs. Hollander's class, but then all of a sudden I was at home and we were setting up this strange answering machine that worked in concert with the computer. And first when we set it up, it requested that you pour a quart of water into it, which was totally bizarre. And [laugh] so we did, and then the computer started up and went through its start-up procedure, and when it gets to the part where you see the Windows symbol before the desktop comes up, we saw this like colorful color pattern, like one of my tops that's real colorful, and this color pattern just kind of stayed there. And somehow I had the notion that we had to give this answering machine food that we ate and samples of our blood and information."
"B-134"	"#B-134 (2002-06-21 (17)) We were camping and our family was like it was when I was little. I don't know exactly how old I was. I must have been little too, I just didn't feel little. I was acting like I was big. But I felt little compared to the others. [Mom -- when you were little, you always acted like you were big.] Well anyway, we had Samantha and Sandra, but we also had three boys instead of just Derek. We had a big boy named Quinn, like in his 20's, we had a big Derek, about 17 or so and we had a little Derek who was like 8 or 10. And the two big boys were alright; the girls were kind of reserved and shy like I was probably at that age. And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Derek was scary, though. He had red hair and he would run around. He was a boisterous little thing. And, you know, I think I saw him near the keyboard a few times. He was carrying it around and running through the woods with it. And I can't remember too much about what happened during the dream or anything. I just remember that whenever the little Derek was around, I was really scared. And that's all I can remember. [Mom: I think you can identify with the big Derek, because he's your big brother that you talk to on the phone with music and stuff. But the little Derek is the little guy that scared you with the noises when you were little, and in your dream you've kind of combined both of them because they always, there was a while there where Derek and Ronnie were wearing camouflage and they were big boys compared to you when you were little. "
"B-135"	"#B-135 (2002-06-24 (17)) I had a very significant dream last night and I think it's perfectly explainable, but it's one of those that's like near and dear to my heart, even though it was extremely embarrassing if it had really happened in real life. Okay, I can't remember any of the miscellaneous that were going on beforehand and some other little side dreams, but I do remember the main part. I dreamt that I had been practicing on the keyboard and I had it plugged in with an AC adapter to the extension cord under my dresser, and it was set up on top of its box on the bed so that I could stand up straight and sing, but still be able to see the keys like I did that one time when they were at the movies. And all the lights were off in the bedroom and I was talking to Mom in her work room. And I go in the bedroom and I turn the lights on, but for some reason, me turning on the lights powers up that extension cord underneath my dresser -- it doesn't really, but it did in my dream. And having power at that AC adapter powered up the keyboard, even though I didn't turn it on. And that familiar robot voice that greet us and I was like, ""Oh my gosh, you mean to tell me I didn't put it away?"" And so, and then it said, ""Select a song."" And then it starts playing this song because, see, in real life it can do this song demonstration thing, and when you activate it, it says, ""Select a song."" So we did that, but it started playing this song to demonstrate, but it was like a Celine Dion song from 94.1. That was kind of cool. And then Mom wanted me to teach her how to do some things and teach her about the notes of the staff and all, so I turn it off for a minute and I go to my desk and I draw a five-line staff and I start labeling the lines and spaces on scrap paper. And I'm ready to go back and give it to Mom and start teaching her, and next thing I know, she's back in her room sorting her papers and I missed my chance to teach her and show her. And then I woke up, and I was so mad when I woke up. I think I had this dream that I missed a chance to show her something because I don't want to be too stuck on a one-track mind. I've been thinking a lot about that lately, and I've been practicing on it every chance I get when there's nobody in the house. And I really am dying to show Mom some music theory and stuff, but I don't want to just, I'm so shy, and it's like when I bring this thing out and am practicing on it, I swear I'm never going to tell anybody. But I always end up telling Mom anyway. [laugh]"
"B-136"	"#B-136 (2002-06-25 (17)) It was my last day of school again. First I dreamt that I had to clean out my locker, so I had to carry several notebooks and this stuffed Kermit the Frog around school all day because my locker was going to be cleaned out. And I dreamt that I was skipping Mrs. Hollander's class in the courtyard. And then they announced that everybody has to report to the auditorium for a really formal assembly and they were going to talk about the history of man and radio or something like that, and they said, ""If you don't have formal enough clothes to wear, stop by and we'll give you some."" So we headed on over there and we were hearing the sound check in the auditorium, and then I woke up, never did -- oh, and suddenly I realized I was naked, so I'm walking around topless with newspaper kind of around my bottom. So I heard the sound check in the auditorium and then I woke up. I wasn't able to even get in there."
"B-137"	"#B-137 (2002-06-27 (17)) I was walking around with an IFB box clipped to my belt, and I had a set of headphones on, and I had two microphones, one in each hand. One was a lavaliere clip one and one was like a wired heavier one. And I was talking to people and people were talking to me. And the level in my ears was like really loud, and I was trying to figure out how to turn it down so I wouldn't feel so nervous. And instead of turning it down, I turned it up and it was even louder, and I just couldn't control it after that. And I was like walking around the back yard with this stuff and stuff. And then I dreamt that I was going to create a mermaid poster show, like a mermaid audio show with topic figures, and I was going to use all my voice except Flounder was going to be a kind of my voice at a faster speed. My voice in real time was going to be Ariel, my voice slowed down a little bit was going to be Sebastian, and my voice slowed way down was going to be Triton. And I was going to like make these figures on a cardboard and make them go around the stage and play this strange audio. And I was thinking how I was going to write all the music and stuff for it and everything. And I got to drawing the figures, and then I just kind of woke up. Now maybe that's a really good idea. I should do that for real now, shouldn't I? "
"B-138"	"#B-138 (2002-06-28 (17)) First I dreamt that Dad was doing some kind of remodeling up here, and I not only had a fan with black blades, but I had this air conditioner that was mounted in the ceiling and I was going to control it on the wall with the fan switches. And so I remember I didn't know how to shut off the air conditioner and I was ice cold, and I was going to tell Mom to come shut it off. And I dreamt that in Mom's room, she had this rack CD player that was like a box machine that goes with system stuff. And it was kind of silvery and it had a little design in the front. And I was trying to figure how she worked it and stuff. And it wasn't connected to any amplifiers or anything, so I don't know how she got sound out of it, but I remember it was pretty, kind of neat, and I was thinking, oh, she could finally play CD's and maybe she'll start getting rid of her tapes. And then I dreamt that Mom had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with Mom, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, Mom told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but didn't want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV. And what do they call that -- obstetrician? [Mother: for the woman; for the baby it's pediatrician.] But I mean when the baby's pregnant. [Mother: no, when the mother's pregnant with the baby.] [laugh] [Mother: you mean the mother's going to have the baby, not the baby's going to have the mother. That's the obstetrician.] Yeah, that's what I mean! [laugh] Anyway, the obstetrician is Dr. Rosenwax -- she blabbed it all over TV. But anyway, so there were these ducks and these geese hanging out by these kids and they were so tame. And I was over at another booth doing something, and I was crawling over to the booth where Mom is because there were these air vent gratings in this tent thing, and I was crawling on this tent material over to where Mom was. And then I was just sitting down doing nothing, and I had my mini-disc recorder for the radio station, but I didn't have the personal CD player. Next thing I knew I was riding home in the car with Dick Jorgenson, and he was talking to me about editing and stuff, and about -- I forgot my personal CD player, but I could have transferred some songs to the mini disc player so I could have one thing to do both jobs. And then I woke up. "
"B-139"	"#B-139 (2002-06-30 (17)) I was going to be singing in a chorus conducted by some guy, and well, get this -- I was laying down on the stage and I was kind of half awake and half asleep on the stage, and this guy who knew the teacher conductor was trying to fix up the sound system, and there were a couple of kids helping him. There was like a podium on each side of the stage with a speaker mounted in it, and on the back of the podium there was, where the person stands, there were the two binding post connections and they were like running wires all over the stage getting them back to the main unit. And then next thing I knew, I was still laying down on the stage while they were doing all this, they were putting ""Planet Soul"" on the CD player and they're playing it [laugh] , and next thing I know we're all standing up and we're posing for a picture. And there's this little boy, and then when we were standing up posing up for the picture, I realized that we were in the Oceanside Elementary School cafeteria, and there's this little boy down at the floor level where the lunch tables are, and he said, ""Smile for the picture. Thank the sound engineer."" And then somebody flashed a camera and then I woke up."
"B-140"	"#B-140 (2002-07-07 (17)) I was watching this documentary that I had taped on TV, like this news program or something, and it was Celine Dion at her computer going through some MIDI files on her website and Rene-Charles, her baby, was on her lap, and she was explaining to the viewing audience which songs that Rene liked and which ones made him nervous and put him on edge, and which ones he liked. And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And [sigh] then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, ""I'm three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you."" And I don't remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up."
"B-141"	"#B-141 (2002-07-08 (17)) I was DJ'ing the most bummer party ever. Okay, here's the deal: the Peavey system was set up out in the back yard, and there was a handful of people out there. And I was still inside rummaging g around, trying to get all my CD's together and stuff. And it took me like a half an hour to an hour to get them all together and ready. And then I came outside and it was dark already and there were some more people. And I was going to, I sat down at my table and I was putting this CD in, and everybody was just kind of totally like they didn't even hear it, and nobody was dancing, they were just all kind of ""duhhhhh,"" like they just didn't even hear it. So I put on something else and I crank it up a little louder, and they still just like kind of ""duhhhhh,"" like they don't even hear it. And I can't remember what I did, but I think I just was totally not ready and my system was cuckooing out on me and stuff, and it was just a real bummer of a party."
"B-142"	"#B-142 (2002-07-10 (17)) I was at Six Flags with Hayleigh and Stacy and their gang, except one girl was named Jenn, another girl was named Bush and we were with our kids too. And we stayed on one side of the park that looked like Circle Lake and then we were at this petting zoo section, but we didn't go in the section where all the rides and the show and stuff are that I'm familiar with. We mostly just stayed at one end of the park and walked around and stuff. And then we met up with Dad over at the petting zoo section and all the girls went on to do something else, and I was stopping and talking, and I was standing under the post of the fence of the petting zoo and I was talking and she said that there's this, he was glad we stayed on this side and all. And I was thinking, ""Yeah, of course she would be."" And there was this person that was going to do a concert show that was a guitarist from the '50's, and I didn't know the difference in my dream between a gunner and a guitarist, so I kind of thought that guns were like guitars and guitars were like guns. I don't know why I would think something so whacko. I mean, they're, I don't know, they don't even make a similar sound. Well anyway, and then I dreamt that we were home and I was looking around the house as if it were Six Flags, trying to find stuff, and then I realized I was at home and I shouldn't even be looking. Then I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, which they were because they were at Six Flags with us. And they were, I mean, I was laying in bed and Derek was like in the shower and he had this tube and he was spraying water at me and stuff. And so I closed the door. Then he came in with a cup of water and I thought he was going to pour it on my head, but instead I like got him in a wrestling hold, and he was like, ""Ahhh, you gave me snake bite."" And I was thinking, ""What in the world is a snake bite?"" And we started like kind of wrestling and the cup of water just kind of went away, and he kept saying, ""Ah, you gave me a snake bite!"" And then I dreamt that that all went away and I was kind of snuggling with Sandra the way I snuggle with Mom and I was telling, I felt comfortable enough to tell her the story of way we found the keyboard, and I started asking her if she remembered when we had it, and she said, ""Yeah, I know. Your mother kept asking us to take it each time we came, and I didn't want to take it because Dawn [their real mother] said don't take stuff from you."" And I was just like, ""Okay,"" I wasn't hurt or anything, I mean, I was just sort of like, ""Okay."" And I was drawing little bitty pictures in this notebook while I was talking to her. Somehow And I didn't tell her the rest of the story; I never did. And then I woke up. Oh, and I dreamt that the time said like 10:35 and when I woke up it was 7:30."
"B-143"	"#B-143 (2002-07-13 (17)) Okay, this is sometime in the middle of July, 2002. Last night I dreamt that I was at Bancroft Middle School, but I was in Warrior Vision from Westport High School, and I was sitting there at their board and it had a blue faders except they weren't uniform all the way across. The mono-mike channels were pots and the rest were blue faders, and I was trying to work this board and we were under a lot of stress to try and get this show done right now, and Mrs. Talmadge was trying to get us to do something. And then the bell rang and Melinda came over to me and said that Mrs. Hollander's class was going to be in the auditorium. And then all of a sudden the halls and stuff were like at Bancroft, and Mrs. Hollander's class was up on this other floor and I had to run up to her room and get my stuff. And then I was like running through the halls to get to the auditorium on time. I had books in my arm, but no bag, and I was running through the halls and I was coming down a stair thing and I fell face first, I was like falling down the stairs and then I woke, and my books went everywhere and I woke up."
"B-144"	"#B-144 (2002-07-14 (17)) Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, ""Wow, girl!"" And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they weren't ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I wasn't steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I didn't want Dad to know that I ""drove"" even though I didn't drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, ""Nah,"" and I don't remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up."
"B-145"	"#B-145 (2002-07-25 (17)) First of all, this was after everybody left and after all the dust settled and I could start remembering my dreams again and I wouldn't get so tired. I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and I was all dressed and ready to go, and I had my book bag and my books and stuff. It was going to be my first day. And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control. And I went in there and I got myself all wet. They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, ""Alright."" And then I got my shoes and stuff and told Mom about it, and I don't remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, ""Where is that coming from?"" and Samantha pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, ""This is a magic chick; now watch it."" And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, ""Hi, I'm a magic chick. If you want to play magic,"" something about the something blue. You'd have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something. And then it would say, ""Hi, I'm a magic chick, if you want to play magic,"" something like that, and then it would start to play this recording of when I would do magic shows. That was like weird. "
"B-146"	"#B-146 (2002-07-27 (17)) My birthday was fast approaching. I was at the fire station and they were making me this birthday cake. They like putting roses and stuff and sprinkles and I would go over and snitch some. And they were gearing up for a birthday party for me, but then I remembered that my birthday wasn't until March, and then what in the world were they doing, getting ready for a birthday for me? And as I was getting my stuff ready to go out the door, the parrot started singing, ""Happy birthday,"" to me. [laugh] That was kind of weird. Then I dreamt that I was taking a music class in college, and that this kind of Spanish lady was teaching it. And we were going over some theory and stuff, and she was surprised at how much I knew. And she was saying how she's going to have to catch me up a little on what I missed. Then I dreamt that there was this battery charger thing that was supposed to absorb the acid if they corroded. It was like a traveling duffel bag, and it was for the keyboard. It was like put the batteries in all in series, and Mom said that it reminded her of cow poop, the way you put them in. And then they would gather (?) they would provide 9 volts and then you would plug it into the adapter. And [laugh] I don't know, somehow we had the notion that that would make it work. And I woke up before we could test it out."
"B-147"	"#B-147 (2002-08-01 (17)) I was starting school and that things had really, really changed. We were in this auditorium that kind of put me in mind of a cross between the Hayes High School auditorium and the gym at Bancroft Middle School. The seats were not just slanted a little bit, but they were like way slanted like bleachers are. And they were different colors like in the Hayes High School auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage. And I had the notion that for chorus class there was going to be this male performer opera singer going to teach it, and for some reason I had the notion that he wasn't as good, that he was very basic. And I reasoned in my head that the more advanced classes were going to be taught by Mrs. Dougherty, but that this man was going to teach kind of the introductory and beginning and basic classes. And I can't remember too much, so I woke up."
"B-148"	"#B-148 (2002-08-05 (17)) The kids were still in town, and that Samantha and Sandra I was having such a good time with, and I was really sad about them leaving. But for some reason I was remembering a lot of things in my childhood to do like with Bluebird and stuff, and I was pacing around upstairs, and I was really nervous. And it seemed that all the girls were taking a shower and Derek was reading, but I came downstairs and I thought I heard Derek playing the keyboard in the bedroom. And I know this is really stupid, but I'm going to have to say it anyway in order so that I can analyze my thoughts later. I dreamt that in order for the keyboard to work, we had to bake a cake, and there was this cake. And [laugh] everybody would eat a piece of the cake, and when it was all gone, it wouldn't work any more. And I don't know what the connection was or why that happened like that, but it was weird. And it wasn't anything wild like he used to do. He was really sincerely trying to learn a song, and it was the Entertainer song that the ice cream truck plays all the time. And let's see, I dreamt that we also had a pineapple cake and a pear cake that I really wanted a piece of, but apparently Mom said they had containers that snapped shut and she couldn't get them open without making a whole bunch of noise. But she wanted to save them for when it was just us, so when I wanted a piece of cake, I had to have the other cake that made the thing work. That is so bizarre. How bizarre; how bizarre. And I also remember that later on I got my school schedule, and we had to whip up this like cake mix in order for my schedule to coincide. [laugh] And it was this like real powdery, awful-tasting cake mix we just had to whip up, and we had to spread it all over everywhere. [laugh] And I dreamt that I was going around on my first school schedule and that I stayed back and was talking and talking with Mrs. Dougherty with Mom, and that I missed Math completely, and there was an absence on my first day. And Dad was complaining about it, and we said, ""What's he complaining about now?"" And there were these pictures, and there was one of Mrs. Gresham, there was one of Mrs. Hollander and there was one of Mrs. Dougherty. There were these pictures that were like photo pictures, I guess. And Mrs. Hollander's was bigger than life, and it was like almost poster size except it was just the head. And she had a blue background, like she had this beaver outfit on like she was this beaver on stage, and her hand was extending off to the side into the next picture. And her hand was extending like almost over the top of the Mrs. Dougherty picture, except you could still see her. It was just that the hand was in the way of the picture. And I dreamt that I was going to enlarge the other one and fix it up and get rid of Mrs. Hollander's hand and all, so that hers would be bigger than life. Now I think that could have some meaning to it because Mrs. Hollander is pretty vain and stuff, I think, and [sigh] so, I think, and that's it. That was bizarre, huh?"
"B-149"	"#B-149 (2002-08-06 (17)) I had one of those stupid dreams I could have sworn I've had before. Has anybody ever had some of those? Well anyway, I dreamt that I was sick and that I was going through cards at my desk. And somehow I had the notion that I was in a Bible school for elementary kids. I think that came from Melinda's church and all. But then I had this card that was signed by Celine Dion and I just knew I had to keep it safe with my other memoirs and stuff. And then I had this goofy, goofy card, it said, ""Oldies 95.1"" and it was like all gold and silver and stuff and it had a hole in the middle where you put -- I don't know -- a pin or something. And then I came back in my room and the clock said that it was 12:45 or some odd hour of the morning, and one of the LEDs was just totally shot so it didn't light up. And [laugh] that's it."

And apparently a fire got started, a little fire with some of the matches, and Dad was showing me how to put out the fire that distracted me from being scared of the voodoo in the ""Snake Bite"" song. And then I dreamt that there was this movie that Mom and Dad were going to see. It was in the middle of some kind of a theme park. And how they would do it was, it would be totally, totally, totally dark in the place where they would go and stand, and this mask that they would put on would be blue. And they would not see anything until the movie would come on, and sometimes that would be a little scary. And I don't remember too much else, but it was kind of fragmented last night."

But anyway, we were still in Spain and we were all roller blading down the street, and then we were going to go see a show of somebody rollerblading. So we got in these escalators and held onto the railings. They went twice as fast as normal ones do. I think maybe even three times faster. We went up four or five of them until we got to like this place where there were chairs for everybody and a little road thing. And I sat on a ramp right in the front, and my feet like dangled into the middle of the road thing, and then Mrs. Hollander told us that we were too early and we have to come back in a half an hour. And then I had another dream that we were at dinner, and we were eating and eating these things. And I had already had a course, and this Spanish waiter came by with this tray with six compartments in it and gave me two spoonfuls from each compartment, and it was like, ""Oh gosh, more to eat?"" And I had some water that I was drinking, and then I was offered some vanilla ice cream and it turned out to be milk. And then I had another dream that we were walking around we went in this church. Let me think a minute. I remember more to it now. Some of our group was performing up there and going to sing and play their band instruments, and Clark and Marilou and Colin Hanks were sitting by the sound board, and Marilou was going to run it. And she was showing it to me and showing me all the things about it. And it was silvery with white faders, and it had these little white levers that you could make it say certain words, so you could just like make them say these words. And then the preacher came up and was preaching about these boys that all they wanted to do was fight and broke things up. And there was an image of some men up on the wall and the priest asked, ""What would you do if this image wasn't there?) and these wives would stand up and say, ""You stole our husbands' image."" And then I woke up."

And so we sat back down. He put this like practice thing up on the overhead, he gave us each a little notebook about the size of a, about four times the size of a matchbook, and it had little tiny shapes of staff paper in it. It was kind of like a measure note pad, and we were supposed to, except these little pieces of staff paper were like dated and titled and stuff, and we were supposed to keep our little practice things in it. And he was going to collect them, like writing a sharp on this line and putting this something-or-other on that space, and what does this mean, what does that mean and stuff like that. I don't remember too much about what it was. And I dreamt that instead of doing the practice, I was writing a story in this thing about someone being a very kind and gentle musician and nobody realizing it. And then I woke up. That was kind of dumb, huh?"
"B-153"	"#B-153 (2002-08-12 (17)) I was in this store called Anderson Audio, like Derek works at, and it had audio stuff in it. And I was walking around and looking at different stuff, but I saw a bunch of furniture and stuff in addition to that. Then I went up to the front counter, and the lady at the front was so impressed with me and she was showing me these things that she had in her display case. First she showed me a porcelain music box rocking horse with this saddle that was made out of this really, really soft material, and it was ornate and stuff. And then she showed me this snow globe that was in the shape of a Santa face. It was flat and it was plastic, and when you tip it upside down, the lyrics to ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" -- each word was on a little black piece of plastic and they would all just kind of fall into place and be suspended in the water, and you'd tip it upright again. And then lastly she showed me this show globe that had a cardinal in it, and it was like the one with two cardinals from M____ that ________. And it was part of that collection. And she gave me the rocking horse and the cardinal for half price, but I wasn't really interested in the snow globe. And then I woke up."
"B-154"	"#B-154 (2002-08-12 (17)) I was going to be the prom DJ, the DJ for the high school prom. And it's not anywhere near prom time. I don't know where this came from, but I did participate in a wedding and was the DJ, so maybe that's it. But anyway, I dreamt that our foyer was like four or five times as big as it really is, and I had my equipment set up and I was lining up CD's and getting ready because I had the notion that the prom people were going to just start filling up, coming in the house and filling up our foyer. And so I'm getting ready, getting techno stuff together and all, and next thing I know, my equipment won't work right and I have to have like a long time to like, I'm looking for this certain connector that I need and I can't find it. For some reason I need a 8"" mini connection, and I usually don't use that unless I'm using my boombox, but I wasn't this time, so I don't know. Then I suddenly dreamt that -- this must have been another one of those dreams that you have that feel like they're connected -- I dreamt that we were at Melinda's house and we were in this small, tiny little kitchen that led out into this grand foyer with this staircase and everything. And it was pouring down rain outside. And I think it was Melinda's cousin or brother-in-law -- some relative of hers that was kind of a young man in his 20s. And he was telling me about how he likes to play the trumpet. And I guess it was Thomas, because Thomas plays the trumpet. And he was saying how a keyboard is such a great thing because you can make it make all kinds of different sounds. And if you don't really play a certain instrument, but you want it in your song, you can make it make that sound if it's the right kind of synthesizer. And by this time I was like swinging on a swing, hanging from one of these stairwell things, and I think Mom comes in from the pouring rain and we go in that small little kitchen, and Melinda's asking about a mini disc. She thinks she wants to have something in the mini disc format. And so I told her I would show her my recorder from the radio station and then I woke up."

And there was like this carport thing in the front, and there was this blonde lady that was about 25 who was trying to tell me how to set up the sound system and what to do. And I don't remember if I set it up or not, and I don't even remember what she was telling me, but I do remember going in the bathroom and seeing this huge like garbage disposal like type thing. And people would throw their garbage in it, they would throw their dirty laundry in it, and there was a little toilet on top. People would even go to the bathroom in it. And they would like flush this _____ handle that would be like flushing a toilet. And for some reason I had the notion that it was getting plugged up and stuff and we were going to have to take some of the dirty laundry out of there. That was cuckoo, man! [laugh]"

It was modern-looking and there was this room with this huge king-sized bed. And get this -- this is so weird! Chelsea and Josh and Frieda and Zane -- those two couples -- and Charmane and David wanted to do it all in the same bed. [laugh] And there was enough room because it was this huge king-sized bed. And [laugh] there was this young girl about 19 or 20, maybe 27, Hannah her name was, and she's like, ""Come lay down with me, Jessie, come lay down with me,"" and I was real, real hesitant because I didn't want to get in the middle of all that stuff going all over everywhere. And she had her back to all of them and I laid down with her, and next thing I know I went to sleep and then I woke up. And during that, they were all like sharing things and sharing pads and sharing condoms and stuff. It was like going to a public bath and watching everybody bathe, but this was going to a public bed.

It was like basically an aquarium with the Little Mermaid stuff in it, and it had to get permission to be out of class for like two days a week for the rest of the semester to work on it. And I dreamt that I got it online and I got two of the raw materials to do it. I got the stand and the top, and the aquarium itself was going to be in a teapot and I got that. And I set it on the counter ready to go, and I, all of a sudden I was in this reception hall with my system, Peavey system set up and I was adjusting the faders so somebody could talk on the microphone as they wished and it wouldn't feed back. [laugh] And I couldn't remember who was talking on it or what they said, but they were walking around pretty good and I was real nervous they were going to go over too close to the speakers and make it feed back, and then I would be blamed for it. And I do remember there was a guy next to me which I was adjusting the equalizer, well, while the person was talking on the microphone I started a Kenny D CD playing, and the EQ just sounded terrible, so I was sitting there adjusting it. And I was telling this guy that was sitting there that I keep my hand on the microphone fader so that if it starts to feed, I can just bring it down immediately. And I remember then we were starting to pack it up, and for some reason I realized I was naked. And I was putting all the stuff back in the boxes. I only put one of the speakers on top of the Peavey box and Dad was already hauling it out to the truck and there was another stand standing freely. Then I don't remember what happened, and then I woke up."

I dreamt that I was listening to the clock radio some more and Mom was talking to me, and we checked it before I went to sleep. But I could not get it to shut off, and I was trying all kinds of different things like make sure the s______ function's off, make sure the alarm's off, make sure the switch is off. I could not get it to turn off. I had to like take it apart just to make it shut off so I could go to sleep, and then I was really frustrated. And then I remember I came down to the couch with Mom, where we had the system on, and Dad was there and he started talking to us and we were having like a family conference at 11:30 at night. And then she was going to the swing, and I was getting back to bed. And then I remember being at this reception hall -- I've been having dreams about that lately. But, you know what it was? We were at Modern Media College taking a tour and we had this -- it was Melinda, me, Mom and Angel, I think -- we had this really funny elevator we had to keep going up and down. And we were in the lobby that looked like the reception hall where we had the wedding, and then we came down this funny elevator and we landed in the parking garage, supposedly go into another building. And we saw Mrs. Hollander across the parking lot, which is the lady who gave me the four-year degree lecture several times. And we just waved and smiled, and she said, ""Are you here seeing the school?"" and I woke up before I could answer."

And we were working and then I found Dad in the back somewhere and we were looking around, and we came to the back where this, it was kind of in this little booth on this little platform, but we were sitting at the edge of it. This lady had a cello and she was showing it to us. And I can't remember why, but something came up about a G, and I was, I immediately sang a G, thinking that I knew it, and I was like, ""This is a G; let's see if I'm right."" And then she played a G on her cello and it was like two or three steps below, and she was, ""Sorry, but you weren't right."" And I was like, ""Well, I guess I wasn't.""

And I remember Mom and I wanted to get out of there soon, but I think she was talking to somebody while we were running around. And then when we finally did get out of there, we went to these people's wedding, and I was so mad because we didn't get there to catch the beginning of the wedding. We got there like after the ceremony was over. And I can't even remember who it was, but I had the notion that I was one of the bridesmaids for some odd reason. Then were at Westport High School and I was asking Melinda how I went with Mrs. Dougherty because she had talked to her the day before, and she just said that she wanted Melinda to help her collect notebooks and things.

And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn't screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn't see them. And I don't remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I don't know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting. [laugh]"

But then, when I went back to sleep, I dreamt that I was looking at these clocks because I was doing something before and I can't remember what I was doing. I sat here and thought about it a little and I can't remember. So I was looking at several clocks and I realized that neither one of them was giving me the right time. They had crazy whacko things.

And we sat on a bench and we were talking and talking about all kinds of different stuff. And we were talking until like 5:30 pm that night, and then she took me home. And I had no idea what time it was, and Mom and Dad weren't really mad or anything, but they were wondering why would I be out so long with somebody and not call them and let them know.

"B-165"	"#B-165 (2002-08-31 (17)) Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Clementine Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I couldn't find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time's getting short and it's really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there weren't three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I didn't care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They weren't there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound & Vision in the back seat of the car. [laugh] And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I didn't need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it wasn't on. It wasn't like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I don't know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Clementine Springs; I wonder what that could mean."
"B-166"	"#B-166 (2002-09-03 (17)) I had this dream, and it's 4:30 in the morning, and now I am wide awake. [laugh] But, oh well, this dream is quite interesting and encompasses a lot of different things. First I dreamt that I was in the bedroom and I was trying to set up a two-channel stereo system. Or no, I was trying to fix the speaker connection because they'd come undone. So I shut off the receiver and unplugged it just to be safe. And I was making the connections with the binding posts -- you know how that goes -- and I dreamt that in my dream we had a sub in the bedroom, which we don't. And that seemed to be alright; I didn't have to do anything like that. So I fixed the connections and then I turned the receiver back on and I was putting the speaker back in place, and the wires came undone. And I was real afraid to touch them because, of course, when the receiver's on they're carrying power and I knew not to touch them or I'd be shocked. And then I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake. By the way, this dream is going to probably take up the whole of this tape. I dreamt that Dad was baking a mixer cake and it was really cool, and he was kind of joking, like he is, about ""Don't let Mom get all the cake,"" and stuff, and we were deciding on sizes for the cake by how many faders we have because we were cutting the cake with lines and we were cutting it according to, like we would say, ""I want four of these channel strips, so I want two of the shell (?) strips,"" and that would be how we'd know what sizes of the cake we want. Then I dreamt that I was writing these notes about how my life is being changed over the years, and I was writing these notes so that I could write this essay. And I was writing about the different phases that I went through, like first it was the toddler stage and then my animal magic show stage was 6-9, and I said that I had went through a real shy phase when I was little, which I really didn't, but in my dream I thought I had. And in all of this Dad asked about the music major, and, of course, I hadn't said anything, I haven't said anything to him about it. So I just kind of said, like I just kind of like beat around the bush, I guess. And he asked about it more directly again, and I was kind of stunned. Well, actually, I wasn't really too, too stunned yet, and I just said, ""Oh, we found it like 20 years later and it needed work,"" or something like that. I then I stepped away to do something and he's baking another cake. Or I think then I come home from shopping with Mom, and there it is, sitting on the table, and all the flour and all the mess. And it's like sitting there in all its glory, and I'm like stunned. [laugh] But the thing of it is, Dad thinks he can connect the mixer cake to it. [laugh] And it was hilarious because it's not even a real mixer he's trying to connect to it. And I know for a fact that it didn't have any a______ or audio out, but I was able to mike it and record it through my mixer. [laugh] Here he is, trying to connect a mixer cake to it. And I'm like, he's having Mom and I help him like move stuff, and I'm like grabbing Mom's wrist and like doing the intermittent grip signal, like, ""Oh my gosh, what in the world is happening here?"" And I hated to see it in all the flour and all the mess, but [laugh] everybody was trying to connect it to a real mixer. Oooohhhhhh! But, and then, I had one more part to this dream. I guess you could see why I'm wide awake! Then we were in Cash and Carry and we were looking at Easter bunnies, and over in the Easter Department we were looking at Easter bunnies and I was dancing to this disco music under this strobe light. [laugh] I guess I meant what I said in my song when I said, ""When I run through the pastures of my slumber, you're never out of sight."" I feel I need to add to this that I didn't really feel was important, but now I see it could have some meaning. I dreamt that I was wearing a tee-shirt with a picture of it on it, almost like the tree bird shirt, only it wasn't. It was the color of the tree bird shirt and it had a picture of it on it, only I was walking through Cash and Carry. And I think maybe this could mean that some day -- how should I say it -- I think that I mean to say that some day I'll be brave enough and confident enough to tell the world its story and wear it openly on my heart instead of hidden the way it is now. And I don't know -- I just [sigh] , I've just still got this shy thing going on, I don't know."

And he takes me and he puts me up on the stage where I can talk to the girls, and they're like sitting there setting up their instruments. They're like high school age. And I talked to them like, ""Hey, how you doing?"" and stuff.

For a simple mono voice track, one voice up close that doesn't really record a whole lot, yes I will use this horrible tape. And some -- I don't know -- I used to think it was years, but now it's like a couple of months down the road I might be able to rip all my dreams to MP3 files and put four or five tapes on one disc, because I don't have to worry about the big long explanation, I'll explain it later. Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like Mom and I sit sometimes when she says, ""You big baby."" And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street-like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning -- the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I didn't have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I didn't have time in the morning; it was like 8:00 o'clock already. But now it's all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up. The bit I do remember is that we were supposed to, we were gearing up to go to this Sweet Adelines workshop and next thing I know, Dad and I are in the car and Mom's riding her bike alongside, and then I woke up."

And I even think Ms. Terwilliger (?) was there and Aunt Janice was in this blue dress. We were all sitting in the living room and this house had like a white tile concrete floor and it looked like a typical modern house. And I didn't know whose house it was, but it was one of their houses. And whoever's house it was, but there was this side room like a dining room almost, except there was no dining table. There was a keyboard in there too, and we were all sitting out in the main room talking, and there was this dog that was running around. And then we decided we would all move into the side room for some reason [laugh] and the keyboard was by this time kind of in the way, kind of half blocking the doorway and they were kind of worried that I was going to knock it over. But, of course, I just kind of stood there and like stared for a minute at it, and Ms. Terwilliger told me not to touch it because she had no idea what it was going to do or sound like. So we all sat down on this little couch thing and we started talking. There were chairs and a couch in this room, and we like resumed our conversation. And Aunt Janice goes over and turns this thing on and starts ""practicing,"" except there's only one problem -- it doesn't work really, and she's like practicing away and moving her fingers all around, but there's no sound. There's only a tap, tap, tap, tap. And it's like, what in the world? I guess we know where that came from. And then I woke up and I went back to sleep and I dreamt, I kind of like resumed the dream. I dreamt that we were still in the same house and that I had to get Mom's boombox out of the attic. This house was like some modern house downstairs, but it was our upstairs. So I got Mom's boombox out of the attic, and somehow I had the notion that the people's keyboard wouldn't work because the record key on Mom's boombox was broken off. So I was like trying to fix it, but I think ""record"" and ""play"" were like attached together somehow and I was trying to figure how to attach it back on so that I could record somebody saying something with the boombox. And I attached it the wrong way first, so I had to like take it off and reattach it. And, you know, that's all I remember at this time. What a shame! I should have done this when I first woke up.

And that was really bizarre, and I had the notion that our house had like shrunk or something. And anyway, I realized it was the same-sized house, but I could not fathom why they would move it into Washington, DC when I was on the trip. I also dreamt that we were watching this mermaid movie that had this different story to it. It's all the basic same thing except they say that they're looking and looking all over everywhere, and it kind of takes a twist like Pocahontas because they think Eric kidnapped her and they see her and Eric really love each other and somebody yells that Eric's trying to rape her. And she like, they're all like running after him, trying to get him, and she stops them, actually similar to Pocahontas. And there were these like statues that were drawn on the back of the movie box. One was Triton holding one of the Mermaid's sisters.

I can't remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it's too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason Dad had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I don't know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task ____ board is on my desk now, but here's, Mom gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boombox. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, isn't it? [laugh] Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, ""Do not enter, surprise things."" And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don't remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, ""Oh man!"" But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like [sings a little song] ""______ in the song I sing today. You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a ______ of my slumber. You're never out of thought."" The best I could sing at 4:30 in the morning. [laugh]"
"B-174"	"#B-174 (2002-09-23 (17)) It's about 7:30 this morning, and I was having a lot of little tiny like fragmented funny dreams. The thing of it was, was Dad came up to open doors and windows and woke me up at that hour, and then it took me half an hour to get back to sleep, and when I did, I dreamt that I was in my bed and Mom was bringing up the personal CD player, and she had me listen to a Mick Jagger song, and she was telling me about something -- I forgot what. And then I sort of dreamt that I was seeing red and signs with red writing and I was hearing the first two notes of ""Bluebird"" repeated over and over and over, kind of at a fast tempo. And I was seeing all this red, and It was really scary. And I was sort of somewhat conscious to know that I was in my room, but I was seeing all this red. And then next thing I know I hear Dad's voice, and he said, well first, then I dreamt that the radio was on and it was playing this song from 94.1. Again I was conscious that I was in my room. And I heard, there was this one jazz song called ""Turn Off the Light"" and Dad was there and he was saying, ""When you hear this song, sing lilacs and lilacs, because if you sing, ""Turn Off the Light"" at night, it'll make you think of dark and you'll be scared. That was kind of, I don't know, a little on the bizarre side. The other one was much sweeter."
"B-175"	"#B-175 (2002-09-26 (17)) There were these three or four older teenage boys that were kind of hanging around my house, and later I learned they were band members. And this one -- I can't remember if he was Derek or Justin or something -- but whenever I would see him in the yard, he would always want to like pat me and shake me around, and not really beat me up, but pretend to. And then I would kind of elbow him off and pretend to punch him or something, and he would just, he would not give up, no matter what. He was a pretend fighter. And I was in the yard, and I didn't want him to get me, so I went in the garage and I closed the door, and I was in there with the chickens for a while. [laugh] And the next morning I was with him and all his friends and we were happy as can be. We were sitting around on the picnic table listening to some rap song on the garage outside system that we used to have. And we were like writing songs and stuff for this band, and I was like ready to play the drums [laugh] on the picnic table. And I don't know, but some time before that I was working in the kitchen and I lost my thumb, my left thumb got just sliced off by a knife, and it didn't hurt me too bad or anything. I was just going around without a thumb, without a left thumb. And they called me the thumbless tin smith [laugh] . That was pretty cool, I thought."
"B-176"	"#B-176 (2002-09-28 (17)) We were going camping and we were in the car and we were going all around these different trails and stuff. And then Mom and Dad were going to get out and scout around for a little while, so they left the ignition on; and, I mean, they shut the engine but they left the radio on that is with the ignition. And so they went out scouting around. Well, for some reason the seat came out of the car and was like rolling along on the road, and it turned into like a swing, and I would be able to like fly along the road because of it. And Mom came by and said that at somebody's campsite they had a sound booth, and they were going to play songs on the sound system pretty soon. And I heard a song played and Mom was going to take me over to see the sound booth, but I don't know, something happened. And then Mom came into the room and kind of woke me up. And then I went back to sleep and had another dream, that, well, maybe this was like a continuation of that one, I don't know. I was at Sunset Grill with my equipment, and instead of Suzy being there, there were these three or four boys that were kind of rough. And I had the Peavey system set up and I had the CD writer set up. I was going to burn some CD's. And I was up on the stage and in back of the stage there was this wall where I had a few shelves where I put some equipment. And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers -- one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback. [laugh] Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens! [laugh] So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD/ tape player and they gave me a Spice Girls tape [laugh] . And so we got home and Dad and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it's like an interface with DP. That's bizarre! [laugh] Well, I guess not really; it was like, it wasn't really too bizarre, I guess. And we were playing the Spice Girls tape and I wanted to put it on an audio CD, and we were running it through DP to kind of clean it up some. And then in the middle of that I faded into consciousness, like I drew a cross ______. [laugh]"

And I was also picking out an outfit to go out to dinner with Gram and Grandpa afterwards, and it was all out on the picnic table. And Samantha, Sandra and Derek were around, and so then Sandra needed to go back somewhere and get ready, and Derek and one of his friends started riding around on their little mopeds. And next thing I knew I was sitting with this girl just talking and doing a little bit of studying on the picnic table, and, oh yeah -- then I just totally forgot about Sandra's wedding until Derek rides up on his moped and I said, ""You're just riding around on your old moped while she's getting ready."" And there was this slide over this, that went over the back fence and right into the duck pool [laugh] and so his friends rode his moped down the slide and then jumped off of it and landed in the pool.

And so they came over to see what kind of equipment I had, and I thought they were going to look at the CD writer, the mixer, the amplifier -- stuff like that. But instead they were looking at the digital performer program and how it's set up. And so they did most of the work. They took the rig down and set it up over there in their little sound booth, which was more like a café-style box seat right over the stage, which there were a few spectators in, but there was mostly us. And I made sure I sat the closest to them so I could help them should anything go wrong. And we were all supposed to kind of help each other and do it, but the guy and his 7-year-old daughter did most of it, and I did more watching the play than helping them. And I was looking, from this box seat I could see everything that was going on on the stage, and I could see out into the seats, and I was thinking how Mom and Dad would be looking up at me in the assistant sound technician seat, but I really I did more watching the play than helping them. They didn't really want me to help; they just wanted to use my equipment, so I sat there staring out into space and glancing down at the play every so often. I can't remember anything more. I think when the play went out there was a whole lot of confusion and they just ran off with my equipment, intending to take it to house, I guess. I don't know. And I just waited in that place and Mom and Dad came to get me. And then I woke up. "
"B-179"	"#B-179 (2002-10-05 (17)) We were standing in our front yard at kind of night time, and I was aware that we had our two chickens, our white one and our brown one. Well, coming out of I don't know where, there was another white chicken, another brown chicken, a golden chicken, a goose and two baby chicks that seemed like they had finally come home after being like on the run for like a month or two and we had just forgotten about them and we didn't know where they were. The only thing was the golden chicken was a mean old pecker. She would peck people. And I think the other white chicken was too. It was kind of hard to tell the difference between the old white and brown and the new white and brown. And then I dreamt that I had had a baby. I wasn't sure if had a baby or a baby doll, but I was singing to it. Or I just remember sort of telling somebody that I was singing to a baby. I couldn't remember if I was singing ""Brahms Lullaby"" or ""La La Loo."" But then I was at school and I was in English class, but first I was waiting to get into English class and there was like this thing in the hallway that was like a steering wheel. It was green and it would say if you turn it, the alarm will sound. So I had to get away from that one. The college rep person was there and a few other students were there following me to English class because they needed to get there too. And there was like, I told them I'm usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about the State University and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, ""If you drop out, we'll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we'll still give it back to you."" And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was [laugh] -- well, this is the funny part -- while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo. It was all kind of funny. And then I started fading into consciousness and I was thinking of those things, and I realized I was laying on my back with my arms above my head, and then I woke up."
"B-180"	"#B-180 (2002-10-07 (17)) We were on a boat, and while we were going to this boat show, we were walking along the dock. And we met this guy who had a boat who was really, really friendly. He ended up taking us on his boat because he was impressed with all I knew about sound and stuff, but I don't remember too much about that. But I remember that I got out and I start swimming and there was another boat close by and it was just sort of anchored out. And then I couldn't really help it, I was right at the stern and something just cut my leg like crazy, I think how the propeller does. It wasn't stinging, but the edges were real sharp like a knife, and it just cut up my leg like crazy. But then when I came back into the guy's boat all I had was one little scrape, so I don't know what that was all about. The next thing I knew, we were on land and we were back at the house and trying to, Dad thought we had such a good time, he wanted this, we still had one in our dream, and he wanted to get ours insured and give it a name so that we could. And then I dreamt that we were at this place where 104.7 was sponsoring this ""Friday, Thank God It's Friday"" party. And Mom and I were sitting on these restaurant booth benches, but there was no other side to them. There were these restaurant booth benches with a long table and out in front people would get out and dance and sing and just be real showy like. And there were some people sitting on booths and tables on the other side and a lot of people standing around the edges, and people would come up and dance and all. And everybody was cheering, ""Friday, thank God it's Friday!"" And we were eating some kind of dessert thing, and next thing I know, what should appear in front of me but a keyboard that spanned like six or seven octaves. And it just like appeared in front of me! And Mom said she just laid it in front of me, and I asked her where did she procure it, and she didn't answer me. And I didn't really make a big row thing or anything. All I really could do was smile at her and nod my head, which I think she got the picture because she smiled at me too, I think. And I took her hand and I shook it a little. That's all I really could do. And then next thing I knew, we were in this restaurant, which was adjacent to this party room-like place and it was still there, and we were finishing up and cleaning up some stuff and we were keeping an eye that it was still there. And then Mom went to the bathroom or something and it just disappeared into thin air, and Frieda returned in her place. And Frieda wanted to climb up to the top of this observatory tower with me, and so I started climbing, but I wasn't really into it. We got about half way up and then we turned around. And then I saw myself on TV, and I heard something on the radio that I had the notion was my work, but I don't know. Oh well, then I woke up."

But we cleaning out some stuff, like from Mom's shed, and there was a whole basket of like stuffed animals and stuff from when I was little, and a couple of towels and a couple of little baskets and a couple buckets and, you know, little miscellaneous stuff. And most of it I went through and I said, ""Okay, I want to throw this out and this out and this out. [laugh] But then we came to some stuffed animals and things, and there was this one teddy bear that was really cool. He was sitting in a chair and the chair was covered with a towel. And the towel was like real pretty with like stars and seashells and glittery stuff on it. And I lifted the towel, and it was this talking, singing teddy bear, and he had a keyboard on his lap. And he would like sing songs and play it, and like do like little kids things and stuff. And so anyway, I really thought he was cool and I wanted to keep him for like when we were babysitting. But then when I went to cover him back up with the towel, so nobody would see him, the towel was totally missing. The towel was gone. And I couldn't find it anywhere. It was like it was part of the chair, it was part of the thing. I told you, it was real fancy. And then, since I couldn't find the towel, I sat him in this basket and covered him up with an ordinary towel. And I came in the house for a second -- let me think for a minute -- I think Dad had the TV on and there was one of those parades of things that I used to make when I was real little going around on the floor. And I can't remember what I was doing or where I went or why I went in the house, but I was thinking, ""I have to go out to the picnic table to where I was cleaning out and b___ the teddy bear before somebody throws it out because it's disguised as some other thing.

She was setting up some cooking and some tea and stuff, and Dad and I were going to take this little roller coaster ride type thing, and so we did. We got in line and we sat down on this little two-person roller coaster thing; I was behind him. And we started going and I had forgotten to fasten my safety harness, and I was yelling, ""Wait, wait, wait!"" but it was too late. We were already up in the air, and we like went up in the air off the tracks, and my little seat detached from his and it turned into like a glider, and it would fly how I moved my body and so I kind of flew it with my body. And it was really, really cool. And then we got to this, we were flying across this body of water, this little lake, and we were coming to the dock and I was able to land my little thing right on the dock, which I thought was pretty cool. And so we walked down this little dock bridge path thingy until we got to the little campsite that Mom had set up, and she was like hanging out some wet clothes to dry and cooking up some tea and all. And then I had a second little dream that she had prepared this poster thing, and she had found three or four pictures of Derek with the music major and me like as a little toddler of three years old with a scared look on my face, and then a picture of a guy (?) itself and then a picture of me 17 years old near it with a big smile on my face.

And I was afraid that if we left the candles in there too long, they were going to start to melt down and set things on fire. And so I took them out, and I just took everything out for the time being. And then next thing I knew, we were up on the roof doing a play about some Halloween characters. We were like acting it out, and I was just like a spectator watching all of this. It was Mrs. Dougherty's class I realized, and she was like sitting perched in a tree a few feet away watching us as well. This was in front of my room. Part of the roof in front of Mom's room, we heard Al Jerot playing on a tape player and we heard people singing. And Mrs. Dougherty said, ""Wait a second. My class is supposed to be up here."" And so she kind of got out of the tree and walked over there and saw that it was Mr. Girard's class over there, which really this was switched around because our class should have been doing the singing and his class should have been doing the acting. So then she comes back from talking to him and says, ""My class over here."" And she has us climb out onto the tree and down, and then we're like running around our back yard, which is like four times bigger than it usually is. I think this is going to auto-reverse. I can't believe this thing can't even auto-reverse on its own any more. I have to help it along. But anyway, [laugh] that was the basic point of that. Then we were just running around and playing around. Oh, I know, this group of girls said, ""Jasmine is so good. She only talks to her boyfriend and to her mother.""

And we stopped at one of these floors where they had this like little sitting area, and I dreamt that we were, then all of a sudden, juxtaposed, I was at home with the monitor reading this children's book that was like a variation of Little Mermaid. I keep having dreams about the Little Mermaid having slightly different details to the story, like this time I dreamt that instead of Eric being saved from drowning, for some reason Ariel needed CPR, and in order to break Ursula's spell, instead of kissing her, Eric had to give her two breaths of human breathing so Ariel could stay a human forever instead of a kid.

But then her and I were dancing around in the living room because we were so happy about something; I don't remember what. And let's see, and then when Mom and Dad came back from being out of town, Mom confided in me that the car had automatic horns, whatever that is!

Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere.

But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I didn't want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny.

He was walking around and listening to the concert with me. And then I just remembered something else.

And it had some flashing lights on the railing like emergency vehicles have. And Mom took me down there and she was showing me how to turn on the other lights. See, what people did when they went down into the cellar, okay, so what a person would do when they'd go down in this cellar, is they would turn on the big lights before they turned off the small lights, because if they turned off the small lights first, they would be in total darkness. And I was trying to tell Mom -- she like had me on her shoulder -- I was trying to tell her to turn on the other lights before she showed me how to turn off the small lights, but she didn't listen to me and we turned off the small lights and we were in total darkness.

And so I was setting all this stuff up, and I was setting up the microphone stand, and I was getting ready to do a show and talk to the people who were sitting out there. And I don't remember what happened. Oh, I remember what happened. For some reason or another the microphone wouldn't like start feeding back for some reason and I noticed that the gauge said it wouldn't. And then I went over to the mixer and I notice that whenever I would bring it down to an appropriate level, when I would go over there and stand and talk, it would jump right back up, all the way up. And it would just keep doing that. ______ I'll duct tape in place for you, but we had to turn the system off and unplug it first, and so the show got delayed, of course. And I don't even remember if I ever did it or not. And then we were on the front porch and somebody dumped a whole basket full of kids toys on the porch and I was picking them all up [laugh] and I also had a little basket of sequins. And those three inline signal processors were like on a cart like you wheel around school, along with the big mixer. And I had the notion that I had received those as big presents for Christmas. And it was just, I was on the porch and I was talking to a whole bunch of people, and that's what it was. And then I slowly faded into consciousness."

And get this -- this is really bizarre -- we were in this store, like a Marshall's or a Service Merchandise, and there was this box that was of a teddy bear and what she did was she stuffed the teddy bear with it, and she put the teddy bear in the box and she wrapped the box like a Christmas present, and she put it in my shopping cart.

But I was like part of the story and we were acting it out in this swimming pool. And then all of a sudden it was juxtaposed with the fact that I was at school and that I was just starved. I hadn't eaten in a few days. And two or three people that I know -- they were like girls, I guess, I don't know who they were -- but they were supposed to give me lunch. And they got this big thing of pretzels, a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of soda for all of us. And I had to go do some other errands before I could get there to get to them, but I was running through the school because when I'd go past the boys' bathroom and the boys flush the toilet, it goes, ""Flahhhhhhb,"" kind of like a bathroom tub faucet or shower thing. And so they had flabbing toilets and flabbing sinks in the boys' bathroom at school. So I had to run past that. Then I had to run through a really vulnerable area where the fire alarms would go off at any moment. And I finally got over to in front of the cafeteria where they waiting for me, and somehow I had the notion that a few feet away from us was the boys' bathroom that had flabbing toilets and sinks. And they had a big thing of pretzels and a big thing of chicken nuggets and a big cup of coke, and I started eating a pretzel or two and the girls were all kind of getting silly and laughing and stuff. And I ate a chicken nugget, and I was going to take a drink of soda, but I spilled the whole darned thing, and I was so mad. And I was sure that they thought I was little blind gooch (?). And then the boys' toilet went ""Flahhhhb"" and I got all nervous and spilled something else. And then all of a sudden that was juxtaposed with the fact that I was laying down in the living room while Mom and Dad were watching TV and I realized that I had fulfilled my duty in playing my part in the mermaid story at the swimming pool, and so that was that. And then I woke up."

And I would like to sit in this wheelchair and like scooch along and ooch along and get going at a pretty good speed, and we would be going down brick roads, around and through sand spur trails and through, and across the sand and through water and all kinds of different stuff. And we were nearing Fort Washington Beach and Mom had to lift me over this really big log, and she lifted me up with my chair and all and she put me down on this, the next block that had a great ____ in it. And there was this big electrical box next to it, and the vent was letting out hot air and I was like, ""Aaahhh, aahhhhh, aahhhhh,"" because I was scared. And she was trying to explain something to me, but I didn't really hear her. She was just trying to kind of, I don't know. Then I dreamt that I was in our living room and we had a DVD player and we were trying to adjust the amplifier, and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, there were like seven or eight -- it was at the top of the unit that would change the sound field -- and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, it would cause this terrible, horrible grinding sound like you were shifting the gears in the car, or if you were trying to shift into park while it was still rolling -- that kind of a sound. And so whenever we did that, we had to turn the unit off, change the sound field, and then turn it back on again.

And it was 4:00 and Mom kept diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and we didn't get out 'til 4:30. But when we got out, I learned that the plans had changed and it wasn't Gloria Estefan, it was Bette Midler and she was coming to our yard. So we were setting up chairs and tables and stuff for people, and she was going to stand in the garage and sing. And then amongst all this I realized she is going to need some audio reinforcement. So we got out the Peavey system and Dad was going to play the drums. So he had his drums at his table and I had my mixer at my table, and we were ran the wires and I think we might a microphone by Dad's drums and I ran them into the Peavey board. And, of course, hers. But hers was the far right like it was the master, her fader. And she started singing, and I had to just do it on the fly without a sound check, so I had to guess at the levels and then quickly readjust them as the concert started. And then, in amongst all of this, I realized that all of a sudden we were in an auditorium and I was singing kind of like on a side close to the stage, and I didn't have a mixer, but I had my mini disc recorder and I was recording the whole thing. And she was singing the song, ""Prayer"" by Celine Dion and she was like swirling and spinning through the aisles and I got to see her. And then I dreamt that the lights came up in the auditorium and she was introducing that she was an ID vocal teacher at the school, and that she was going to let some of our ID students perform. And then I woke up. Oh, but no, not yet. I kind of woke up, and I took a look around and then I went back to sleep, and I dreamt that we were going shopping. And we were going down in the cellar of Safeway to see if they had any more cakes or something. And all of a sudden there was this, ""bang, bong,"" and I woke up, and it was the first note to the song that was playing. When it came on, it woke me up, so that was kind of strange."

And they were keeping it a secret from Mrs. Talmadge, but Melinda thought they should tell her and ask her if they could put it on. So she took them in, most of them, but two girls went with me up somewhere into a little area that had like bathroom and then like slides and a couple things. And I had to take my clothes off to take a shower and I just sat there on a swing like type thing just talking to these two girls.

And I was trying to sneak in my mini disc recorder so I could record it, and I was, we were late, so we were rushing around, we were racing through the hallways trying to get to the auditorium, and somewhere on the way I picked up a handful or two or three of gravel from the ground, like stones and sand, and put it in a jar and put the jar in my purse, thinking that when I sat down in my seat and started to rig up my MD machine that the level of the gravel in the jar was going to be the level that I set my VU's at. That was crazy. [laugh] And so we got in there and, first of all, the concert was nothing like I expected it to be, and second of all, there was this lady who, I was taking out my jar of gravel and looking at the side to see how high up the jar it was, and the lady said she didn't want that in there, she didn't want me fiddling around with that during the concert. So I just put it back in my purse, and I just flew by the seat of my pants and started recording. And then, all of a sudden, I was at home, and Dad had this guitar that he sort of knew how to play, and he had it connected to an amplifier.

And there were a couple of people on the other side, and I was recording all this on a mini disc. And then I dreamt that it was starting to rain and we had to get the board inside, a little shelf thing was taking on water. The two engineers and I kept dumping it as we went.

"B-200"	"#B-200 (2002-12-04 (17)) I was at a party at a three-story house. It was kind of a big house. I had a notion that it was the Richardses that were hosting it, but I didn't know who was hosting it. And there were like these tables around with these snack things. There were like two or three bowls of snacks at each table. And there was a pool at this house. And there was like this man. We were on the second floor and we were on a balcony overlooking the pool and this man was like giving us very specific instructions about how to open bags of snacks and serve them, and when to put more out and when to leave the bowls empty, and not to put too much out. And on further analysis, I think this man must have been Mace, Barbara's husband, because when they sent us our invitation, they gave us real specific instructions as to when to come, where to park, don't bring a gift, and please let other people sit down and eat when you're done, and all kinds of stuff like that. So I think that's where that came from. Also something very strange -- the past two times I have dreamt about hearing the ""Wee Sing"" tape, I've been really, really scared and wanting to cling to Mom when ""Bluebird"" is about to come on. I stopped having dreams like that a while ago, and whenever I would dream about the tape, it wouldn't be scary. But now I'm starting to be scared when I have those dreams, but not when I wake up, just in the dream. So I dreamt that all of a sudden we were in this bedroom at the house and the tape was playing and ""London Bridge"" was on, and Mom was going to do something, she was going to fill up more bowls of snacks. And ""Bluebird"" came on and I just clung to her and I was like, ""Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God"" and I was ready to start crying and things. And then I slowly faded into consciousness and I woke up. I don't know what all that's about. But at least the good news is, is I don't wake up really scared like I used to. I just wake up and it's over, and I think about it and go, ""Wow!"" That's strange."

[laugh] And then Uncle Fred told Mom and Dad what I really wanted. Next thing I knew, it was set up on a little tray like my typing keyboard is in my studio. Well, it was set up on a little tray in the TV cabinet in the living room, between the TV and the amplifier. And when Dad and I were sitting there listening to Celine Dion, I got up from the couch and moved the computer chair over in front of the TV cabinet and I pulled out that little tray, and we were hearing this the way it is, and I was trying to play it along with the CD, which I think it was a horrible job, but I don't know. It was just a dream anyway. And then I stood up and I was going over to Dad to ask him how he thought I did. He was sound asleep. He was snoring away, which I thought it was pretty good because I really didn't want him to see me and hear my anyway. [laugh] Then the next time I sat down was when nobody was in the house, and I thought, ""Okay, I am going to sit down and practice and do a decent job this time."" And I sat down and turned it on and it was not connected to the amplifier any more, so I sat down and started checking it out. The amplifier was as light as a feather, so I just lifted it off the shelf and turned it around and looked at the back of it, and it was nothing like I'm used to seeing when I'm conscious. There were no RCA (?) connections whatsoever. It looked more like the back of the car radio, which is probably because that's what we were kind of doing like a few days ago. And I was trying to find a way to kind of jam some bare wire into some connection so that I could get this connection made and get this thing connected to the amplifier again. And just as I was doing that, I heard Mom and Dad coming home in the car and I had wires and connections and stuff all over the living room. And I didn't want them to see that I had been messing around, so I met Dad at the door and said, ""You can't come in right now, I'm working on a surprise."" And he said, ""Well, just guide me in, I'll close my eyes."" And then I woke up, realized it was all a dream and said he can come in if he wants to.

And then, after spraying the hose into the sink faucet for a while, we had to spray the hose down into the garbage disposal and run the garbage disposal for a while. And it made the most horrible, horrible sound and it was the most horrible feeling to me. And somehow I had the notion that this had to be done because I like stayed too long at a party and left the sink running while I was gone or something stupid like that. And it made a sound that really scared me, and I was pretty sure, when I think about it now, I'm pretty sure I've heard it somewhere, but I don't know where.

So I closed it down and set it down, and next thing I know, I'm at school and Mom's a little late and I'm racing to get to Mr. Perry's class on time because I dreamt that it was his exam I had to take. And what the material of his exam was going to consist of was reacting appropriately to a fire drill. And we were racing to get to his class before the alarm class, and we didn't make it. It went off while we were in the hall, and, you know, sound, acoustics-wise, the hall is the worst place you could be when the fire alarm goes off.

But I had the notion that it was one of Celine Dion's first albums, so I picked that one out. And there was another called ""The Swedes"" -- you know, like people from Sweden, the Swedes. And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else.

Oh, I know what it was now! I had set up, well, first of all, I dreamt that all of my sound equipment resided on the computer desk downstairs and that the PC was really the Mac that ran this little performer, and it was all down there. And I had set it up in just a certain way, and there were these three or four people who wanted to see it, how it worked. And all of a sudden the three or four people dwindled down to one girl, and so I explained the difference between the two mixers -- the Peavey and the task cam -- but in my dream they were both black. Then this girl turns on the computer and she's waiting for it to start up, and she doesn't see a desktop right away and she gets a little alarmed, like, ""Hey! Where does this reside in the..."" and then she was like, ""This program, Digital Performer you're talking about, where does it reside?"" And I was like, ""Just be patient; it will come up."" And so when it came up, the desktop was green and I showed her the icon as to where to go and stuff, and I don't remember too much about what she saw when she got in the program or what her reaction to it was. But I do remember all of a sudden there were a ton of people, like Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and a bunch of other family people and a bunch of the Fire Department people. And all of a sudden they wanted me to sing for them, so I go up and I start warming up. Now, you know that when I set up my equipment, I know at least a day in advance so I have a whole half an hour to set it up, to get ready to be amplified on the system. Well, I just wanted to have some accompaniment this time, and I had some stuff started on the CD RW, but my CD recorder is the only one that'll play CD RW's, so I was really in a rock and a hard place because what I was fixing to do was record it onto a tape and play the tape on Mom's boombox while I sang along and not involve the sound system this time, which is what I did, and I came downstairs with the boombox and I set it up, and all the people were gone. There was only like one person and Dad in the living room. And Dad was like, ""You'd better go out there and yell to them. They're all in their cars."" And so I went out there, and I yelled, ""Hey, you guys!"" And they were all gone. But the bird was just going nuts, screeching and screeching and screeching. So I yelled at him, I was going, ""Hey, birdie, stop!"" And at that point some car honked its horn. It had a really funny sound to it. And then I went back inside, and I figured, ""Well, that's a wash. That was a lot of work for nothing."" And even the girl was gone, who was supposedly looking at Digital Performer. And so I went upstairs and I was arranging some stuff back to the way it was, and I realized that I had left the sub on from the last time I had the sound system on, and you know how they require more power and so they have their own amplifiers. So you gotta click the switch on and off, so I forgot to click the switch off and I could hear that it had a little bit of chubba chubba chubba chubba sound, which meant there was an internal cooling fan cooling it off. And so I figured I'll shut it off so it'll quit getting hot and it'll cool itself off. So I reach down, I clicked the switch off, but when I did that, its fan like kicked in full force and it blew all this warm air out at me, and I was like so spooked by that and I ran out of my studio with a yell! And [laugh] that was funny! And I was still spooked and I jumped up on my bed, and I set my hand down and there was a moth ball under my covers, but I got so scared, I thought it was either a mouse or something.

And I was going out to the truck and I realized I forgot my book bag, so I had to say, ""Hold on a second, I've gotta get something and I'll be back real fast."" So I went in, there was a whole crowd of people in the courtyard and I found where I had dumped it. And I went out and that was that. I went home. "
"B-212"	"#B-212 (2003-01-02 (17)) Mom and I were getting ready to take a walk somewhere, and we were sitting in chairs at the house next door to Jean's house, just kind of resting for a minute and Dad was watering his trees. He started yelling at Mom for something and then he started walking away. And I picked up a cinder block that was sitting in the sand and I threw it at him, but I didn't hit him fortunately. [laugh] And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn't hit us, fortunately. [laugh] That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn't scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that Mom's Bose wave radio CD and her boombox both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA's and the boombox needed C's, like it's always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, ""Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"" sound instead of your audio. And you'd think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you'd think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no! So I dealt with that for a while, and in my dream it was scary, and so I was thinking up all kinds of ways to tape the -- the thing of it is, I don't think the boombox had a door to keep them in and so they would fall out. And so I thought of taping them, but I woke up before I could do that."
"B-213"	"#B-213 (2003-01-03 (17)) Somehow I got pregnant, but not by making out with some guy. I think Mom took me to the doctor and had an egg implanted in me or something, and I got pregnant. And I was going to have a baby that was going to be just like me, so that when I grew up and was out of the house, she would still have a Jessie to raise. [laugh] And so we were at the beach and I was going to have the baby in the salt water to make things a lot easier and to make it so I wouldn't have to go through so much pain of labor and stuff. And I started having the baby and the head popped out, and I was asking Mom, ""Does my body naturally push or do I have to act like I'm going poop?"" And she said, ""It naturally happens,"" and the baby was starting to come out and we were going out deeper and deeper into the water. And then when the baby's body started coming out, it was like really, really painful and Mom was like lifting me up to the top of the water and putting me down in the water, and lifting me out of the water and putting me down in the water, thinking that it might shake the baby out. [laugh] And then the baby came out and fell down to the bottom of the water and was going to drown, so we pulled it out real quick and we raced up to the shore. And there was a whole hullabaloo going on up there. I don't remember why though. And there were these clowns and things running around, and we got out and showered off like nothing happened, and then we were going back to the water. And this woman was there, and she said, ""Is that....?"" I had to tell her that this baby was Mom's granddaughter, and oh, it was weird, and I don't remember too much more."

[laugh] There was this company called CP Dock and Surround Affairs, and I had remembered hearing about them one or two other times and in my dream they were coming in our yard to put a pipe -- for some reason put a pipe from under the house in the ground up to the back of where the computer desk is. And that could have been _____, but I don't know why. And, oh yeah, I was just f____ in the dream. And when Dad got home I heard the reason why they put that, I don't know why they put the pipe there, but there was ________. They had taken a broken dock away from another house and they were going to give it to us so that we could put cement out on it and sit out by the alley and listen to surround sound on the little cement dock.

And I took them off and I washed them with water to get all the cookie crumbs and goo off of them, and then I put them in jewel cases and the ones that I have were professionally done, but there were three extras that were like hand-made, hand decorated and home burned. And I dreamt that I was going to put the Celine Dion CD's in the order that they came out, the order that she released them, and I started on that and I had the notion that she sang ""Part of That World"" on the Mermaid movie, when it was really Jodi Benson. And there was this one CD that was pink and it had some hearts, and it was one that was like handmade. And I put that one in, because I thought that was the one that had ""Part of That World"" on it, and it had like a bunch of other stuff, but it wasn't one of those collector series CD's like I thought it was.

And we had to draw in the other half and make it look exactly like the picture. And that was our final exam. Well, I tried that, but I kind of game up and I started drawing all kinds of doodley things. I drew this housewife figure who was running around doing stuff. I drew this really kooky figure of myself and I drew a couple of other doodles. And I had this whole big set of markers and stuff out all over my desk, and they were like rolling off and falling off, and then it was kind of time for me to go. Mom was there to pick me up. And then I had the realization that it wasn't really a serious final exam; it was just sort of a doodley fun thing, and so I took all my doodles with me and I was putting all these markers away, and some of them went into my little art kit and some of them went back to the teacher. It was kind of a guy like Mr. Kitchen, kind of like. Oh, I remember drawing this angel in a plaid jacket, and saying that she was an audio angel, like she did something, and her stuff was like inside of her. And what you had to do is you had to like unsnap her jacket and there would be her sound controls on the front so you wouldn't have to go through all kinds of other stuff trying to get to them. That was just kind of goofy! [laugh] And I can't remember anything more."

It was like some room I've never been in. And this fire alarm box in the back of the room had these like wires attached to it, and what you were supposed to do was attach the wires to some kind of big appliance, and if the big appliance gets too hot, it'll go off. So everybody in the class gets this form to fill out about what they've done in the school year, and so I've ______, and so we're all sitting there writing our papers and the room is so quiet, and this boy in the back of the room is sitting there fiddling with these wires. And Melinda and me are both telling him to stop, but he won't. And then the class starts getting all more commotiony. And then for some reason the teacher switched off the lights and put them overhead, and was teaching us how to write 8's so that they looked good -- you know, how they used to teach us how to write letters in kindergarten? Well, this teacher was so upset with the way we'd been writing 8's. She wanted to teach us how to write them right. And then the class cleared out and Mrs. Dougherty came by and said, ""If you wait here fifteen minutes, I want to come back and practice with you."" Well, I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for it felt like two or three hours, and I went to this little room that had a bathroom. And I took my clothes off and left them in the bathroom, and I went to the bathroom. By the way, I really did have to do when I woke up. [laugh] And it was getting dark outside and I thought that it was like way past the time when I was supposed to go home, so I was going to call Mom and Dad, but just as I was going to call, Mom came up to get me and said that she had been vacuuming the track and so it took her forever.

And I had my tape machine recorder in my purse so that I could record what was going on, and I had my purse on my shoulder and going downstairs with Frieda behind me. And Mom said, ""Tell Frieda about when you had Susan over for dinner and you recorded everything that was going on."" And I didn't want to tell Frieda that. I didn't even want to tell Frieda I was recording now. So I just kind of went down, and we sat down and started eating."

It was kind of small when you first walk in, but then you go through this little door and you're in this big huge area like a real store. And we were looking for something for Bobby. I still had the notion that he's this toddler and we have to look for toys for him sometimes. I guess we always used to until he started coming of age like me. And anyway, I can't remember any specific toys that we were, anyway, I was looking around at these different toys, but I don't remember any specific ones."

[laugh] That is far-fetched, man. And she was telling me about all these things because she was wanting to know if I had actually gone that crazy yet. [laugh] And I told her, ""No way, Jose.""

And she was a foreigner to the others, of course, and we had two white chickens in this dream. So two white chickens and a red one, plus the black one that we found. And the black one was a foreigner to the others, so they would always shoo the black one away. And I had to distract the others and feed the black one. And she wasn't real tame and we had to tame her and like hold her and talk to her to get her to like us better. And I don't think we've ever had a black chicken. And then I dreamt that I was keeping up with Mrs. Hollander and her AP test, and I dreamt that she had totally no confidence in me, that I was going to do well at all in my AP test. She just totally thought I was going to not pass. And she wanted me to come in when she gives her class a practice test, and she wanted me to take it.

They were kind of okay at first, but then they kind of didn't want anything to do with me. And somehow I had the notion that we had a fire alarm system in the house, and that Dad and I were sitting out in the back yard reading or something and they were in the kitchen helping Mom bake a pie. And somehow they knew they knew that she was going to burn something in the oven and that it was going to go off, so they came out of the house and they got in back of the truck, in the bed of the truck, and I was like, ""What are you guys doing in here?"" And they were like, ""I don't know; we don't want to tell you."" And I kind of figured that it was probably going to go off so I climbed in the back with them, and there was just enough room for me to like lay down. And it was real greasy and kind of dirty back there. And Dad got in the cab of the truck and started it up and drove us away, and drove us around the block a few times. And then I dreamt that somebody was getting married and we had to go see them get married, and that they were going to like walk down the street any minute with their stuff. And one other thing -- I dreamt that I was looking through this book of biographies on techno singers, and I was looking for the girl who sings, ""Come Into My Planet Soul."" I can't sing at this hour of the morning! [laugh] And I couldn't find her, and then I think I woke up."

And I was going to sit down at the gorge (?) and edit some stuff I had recorded with him, and so, and also Mom was going to make this soup, and I told her rather than make it before we go and have to wait, why doesn't she take the stuff over and make it in the little kitchen there and make enough for everybody. So she did. She took the ramen noodles and she took some other vegetables and things, and we went to the radio station and I was there with Dick, and I don't really remember doing too much editing. But I do remember her making the soup and stuff."

And then I would sing them, you know how you do when you're learning a song and you sight read it. Well, it was pretty different. It had several more octaves and the on-off keys and all like that were to the right instead of to the left. And I dreamt that after we were done -- well actually, I dreamt that we kept getting interrupted by phone calls and requests from Dad and people coming over. And we were moving around all over the house. And [laugh, sigh] I was kind of, you know, I don't know. [laugh] What the heck?!

And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn't want to tell because he said he's sworn to secrecy and he doesn't want the word to get out. And I was thinking, ""Man, that's a show that I really like, and I never knew that my dad was part of it until now?"" And let's see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marilou and a couple other people.

And Mom thought that she was too late and that he had left for the theater without her, and so she got on her bike and rode down to the theater. And then Dad came home and wondered where she went and I told him that she had gone to the theater, and so they said that they would meet up. So then when he left, I was reasonably sure that it was safe, and I took it out after some hemming and hawing and all that, and it was sitting on its -- oh, I get so tongue-tied! -- anyway, it was sitting on the bed in all its glory when first the phone rings. It's Mom calling from a pay phone to say that she hadn't seen Dad yet. Then I hang up the phone and I go back to what I'm doing, and then the phone rings again like two minutes later, and it's Dad to say that he met up with Mom. So then I go back to my business, and while I'm talking on the phone, I'm just hoping that nobody's going to come to the door. [laugh] And let's see, oh yeah, and then I go back to business, and then Quinn calls! And I'm like, ""Jiminy Christmas, when are these phone calls going to leave me alone!?"" [laugh] And another funny thing that happened is I took care of that and I set it aside. I put it back in its box and I went to set up the sound system for Dad's party that was going to happen that night, and I was done, and so I figured, ""Well, I've got an extra hour before they're supposed to come home. I can go learn some more songs."" And so I took it out again, I set it up, and so I'm learning, ""My Heart Will Go On"" by ear, and I'm chipping and chipping away at way, screwing up here and messing up there, making a terrible total mess of it, but having fun. And next thing I know, what do I hear but the truck, and remember how those keys to turn it on and off are so difficult, and you can't do it with the wrong kind of touch. You can't do it with nervous fingers. And, of course, I was like, ""Ahhhhhh, oh, my gosh!"" And I finally was able to turn it off and saw the LED's go dark, and I shoved it back in its box so fast, and I shoved the box back in its corner. I raced down to meet them, trying to be as calm as I can, [sigh] -- that was some ordeal! But, you know, Mom found out anyway because, first of all, I couldn't keep it from her too long. You know, I tell her everything. And second of all, the box is right by the phone and so when I put the box back, it sat on top of the phone cord, and she knew that I'd been handling it."

I dreamt that Mom was sleeping in bed with me, which she does a lot, but that she was playing the ""La La Loo"" tape, and it was okay, I wasn't scared or anything because I dreamt that the real song that would scare me would be, I think it was, ""Stra la la, stra la la,"" and some other kind of German or Russian words.

I dreamt that I didn't understand natural logarithms at all, and whenever, and my calculator would act up too, and whenever I would enter in a natural logarithm, it would go, ""Error function"" and it would do something really screwy.

Okay, anyway, we had this salad bar set up and it was kind of, I don't know why it put me to mind to a sound board except it had faders on the front, and the salad went where all the rest of the pots would normally go. And Dad was trying to get me to do a mathematical problem to see if people would get more salad if they divided it up evenly, or if people just went up there and just got however much they wanted. That was kind of dumb. I know there was more to it. Lately I've been real bad about not putting my dreams on the tape when I first wake up because that's the best time. I say, ""Oh, I'll do it when I wake up more and my voice sounds a little better,"" but then I forget and then it's like blah.

And I explained that I wouldn't plug it into a mike input because the signal was in stereo. But now that I'm awake and I'm conscious, I doubt that. I don't know if the signal was in mono or stereo. I've seen it recorded in stereo before, but I have a hunch that it's mono, so in that case I would plug it into the quarter inch part of a mike input. [laugh] That was just kind of, I don't know, weird."

And I had to go up to the fourth floor and there was like nothing on the fourth floor. So I came down to the third floor and then I got on the elevator and went up to the fourth floor, and which I found their offices. And I went in the office door and I looked around and I didn't see anybody I knew. So I turned around and I came out and I went out into a parking lot and I went back to school with Melinda and Mom and Dad were waiting there. They said that they had been waiting there for about two hours and they were having a little t______ on where I was. And they had been sitting there like having a picnic, and then we all got in the car and we came home. And I had this like -- I don't know what you want to call it -- this like walking, talking stuffed animal that I had to test. It was like a Furby except it had a man's face for the baseball team for some odd reason. [laugh] And I was getting ready to test it."

And he had a guitar amp sitting on board. And he was playing some big easy bayou stuff and I was dancing and singing with him. And we were just having a blast. And then I kind of was walking around the deck and looking down into the water, and I saw it really black along the edges. And then this man got real serious and I realized that he was Dad, and we had to, he said that the wind was dying down and he was going to have to turn on the motor for ______, and all of a sudden I realized that we were in a real small boat, and I sort of jumped down and started swimming. And I realized that there were these big shells and these chocolate chips on the bottom of the ocean, and I was having a chocolate chips of the sea snack. And then I was swimming because I didn't want to be there when the motor started, and I realized that they were five feet behind me now, and I woke up."

We were at this racetrack because we were going to watch the Grand Prix or a Festival of States parade; I can't remember which, but probably both. We were staying in this little hotel that was like had a view of the track, and there was this guy who was probably a veteran. He organized veteran parades that were like little things that took like ten minutes, and they ran by like every hour. And when they ran by, there was these rescue trucks with these sirens. Some made the standard warble sound, some made the back-up alarm sound, like that interval, and some just made a plain wail sound. And all these going by. Some honked their horns, some didn't. It made a big ruckus and it scared me really bad. And I was laying down in the bed at the hotel and I think Mom was there doing something, and I hear this and it was like totally commotiony. And then we were down there before the actual Festival of States parade was going to take place, and Sandra was there and Mom. I think Dad was there, but he was off helping one of the rescue guys. But anyway, there was this extra long parade by this veteran guy before the actual Festive of States parade started, and I figured, ""Ooh, boy, I'd better get myself out of here."" And so I said I had to use the bathroom, and I went into the hotel's bathroom and I was sitting there and sitting there and sitting there on the toilet, listening to these girls trying on clown dresses and commenting on how they looked. And I faintly, faintly heard all the sirens and rockets in the background, but I wasn't there. And before I said I had to use the bathroom, I was like sitting there on the blanket holding onto Sandra."

So then that I had to take the SCAT test, I could take it home and take as long as I wanted, and I had the notion, and I had this notion that I could go to this website and get all the answers and cheat on it. I was going to do this in my studio and go online with the MAC and so this while I was listening to some kind of CD and just take forever and do this test and get it all right.

First of all I dreamt that I was reading this long epic poem, kind of like the, it was written in the style of the Odyssey, except it was only about an eighth of the length. It was the story in epic poem fashion, and it was about this lady who saw a monster in her swimming pool and it tried to drown her, and from then she was extremely scared of monsters, and what she did and all. And I think one of the lines went something like, ""One time I had this,"" I mean, at one point I had this picture in my head of a lady sitting in the bathtub, leaning over the edge and doing some sewing. And the poem read for those lines, ""And the monster of the water came up and bit off a piece of her head."" And that was real weird, and she was like freaking out because she was so scared of this monster. And I can remember that I kind of like, they were talking about the monster of the water all through this poem, but the last line said something about the monster of Oof. That was weird. And I dreamt that I actually saw the monster in the swimming pool, and I jumped in the swimming pool, for whatever reason. And there was ice around the pool there and it was shallow for a swimming pool. And there was this big guy who was like running around and trying to drown me, but I'm a good, strong swimmer and I got away from him. And then I dreamt that I tried to get out of the bus without my cane and stuff, and I didn't know what the heck bus I was really on, and I didn't have my go card (?) and [laugh] it was just a bad deal.

Then I realized that he was still alive; he was just real sick. And he was home from the hospital for a while and he was laying in our bed, and he seemed to just want to be by himself. We were all eating this cereal from this triangular box. There were all these family coming into town, and I really didn't want to see them. I just wanted to be alone. And let's see what else. When I woke up, I actually had to wipe real tears from my eyes. I don't remember too much more."

And I was walking around upstairs in these people's house, and walking back and forth on this point. There were some Christmas decorations, display figures, up there, and I was talking to, oh no, I was looking down at all the people coming in and I thought I would go down and say hi, so I did. And the next thing I knew, we were in a boat, or we were getting ready to go on a boat with some of the people, and the engine wouldn't start and I was sitting there on the boat with a boombox. The engine wouldn't start and there was this certain tour boat starter thing that made a lot of noise that would start the engine, but first I wanted to get off the boat and go walk around on this little island in the main group while they were doing that. And so I got Mom to take care of the boombox, and I got up and I guess at that moment I woke up."

And he would like, he was obsessed with like people knowing where they are and people feeling safe, but yet he did these things that really wouldn't make them, or really wouldn't make me feel any safer, like, for example, he wanted to put a little alarm thing that kind of sounded like back-up alarms near people's houses so that they would always known where they are. Well, for me that would be just awful. And he wanted to wait until they were sleeping so they couldn't say anything, and he needed a cool, breezy night to do it. And I think what he was going to do was tap into their plumbing pipes and like stick it in lines and that when they turn on their water, the water would go through and activate it. And then he was also wanting to put them in elevators so that if people get stuck, they could make enough racket and be heard. Well, and then we finished the story, and we were starting to look at it and questions. Oh, and I walked out of English class with this girl named Marilla who I have, that sits next to me with my internship seminars. But here she was in my English class and I walked out with her. We were going down the stairs and there, set up on the landing of the stairwell, was a little sound booth, recording studio-like type thing. And Melinda and this boy sat down and they were like listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn't want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using -- not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Melinda kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, ""Why don't you just use one finger?"" And I was like, ""Because two fingers is more precise for me."" And about that time I woke up."

And they had this like, they had made up a long head table, but it didn't seem they had put any table cloth on it yet, and it was this blue table that could seat three. And then they inter_____ these little square tables that can seat four. They put a blue one and two yellow ones together. So as a total, it could seat eight people. Well I thought that we could get more chairs if we took the yellow table and moved it over to the side, and we put Jeff and Nikki and Bart and Quinn over there, and then we could seat -- one, two, three, four, five, six -- we could seat six at our little table that we had joined and then we could have a total of ten seats. [laugh] That was kind of odd. And then we went up to this, oh, and in this ballroom they had like couches around the perimeter for some reason. And then in the, we were up at the counter and they gave us our, all the food for the buffet to take home so that we could keep it cold. That was strange."

But we had to order it online, so we went to this crazy website and we finally found it, and we ordered it. And then, then another dream, I guess, but it seemed contiguous to me. All of a sudden we were going to meet the chorus at Countryside High for that competition thing, and we were sitting in a car for whatever reason, and we were almost late. And there was another school parading past us. We didn't want to jump in their line and screw up their order. So we waited until they went by and then we raced up to our warm up room to find out that I didn't have my black shoes. I had my white shoes. And Mom was saying that Josie probably had some. I had the notion that she was there. And then they said, ""Just don't worry about it."" This was the wrong day anyway. We were supposed to come on a different day. And then another dream, I dreamt that there was this TV commercial advertising like a Frankenstein series of like shows, like Jag. And it showed Madonna talking to Victor, and she said, almost like a kid playing -- first she said, ""There's something I know you know how to do, so let's do it."" And at that she like, she created another person, I think. And it was like, ""Whoa!"" And oh yeah, then a little transient dream I had was there was an empty vitamin bottle [laugh] and Mom wanted me to put it outside for the chickens, and she said, ""Let's give the chickens a nothing treat!"" [laugh] And then I said, ""Okay, let's give the chickens a nothing treat,"" so and I was getting ready to put it outside, but then I realized it still had half my vitamins in it so I put it back in the fridge.

Well, this black chicken decides she's going to jump from the nest onto my arm, and hang onto my shoulder. And this chicken was so heavy, I thought I was going to die. Actually what it was, was she was perched on my arm and trying to hang on by gripping my shirt with her feet on my shoulder. And I don't know why, but I could barely hold up this chicken's weight, and so I kind of had to put her down.

That was pretty odd. And also, I think at the same time, they were doing some kind of concert where they had these like mini synthesized accompaniments and various people were coming up to sing.

And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these -- what's the material? -- I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose.

And so first I dialed 505-0054 and realized that wasn't the one, so put it down and tried again. And then I dialed our land line and I don't think I got through. Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I'm going to say that before I could get through, Mom came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn't have to call.

So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn't know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, Dad was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole. [laugh] So they set up the equipment -- the board and the CD players -- and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so Dad was like, ""You don't have to turn the power off,"" but I didn't want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn't; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn't, so I was real, real cautious. And the RCA jacks weren't these like regular RCA's. They were like flat things that you have to slide into p_____. It was weird, and soon after I woke up."

But today I have a vague memory that we were staying at this hotel at this conference like type thing. I can't remember everything, but I was like, Dad and I were in this bathroom and I was like cleaning myself up because I had been sleeping and sleeping for like until 10:00, which I never do, but that day I did. And Dad decides he's going to turn off this tub faucet and make it flab, and so I'm like naked in the bathroom and I like came out of the bathroom and walked down to our room, and it was totally dark, so nobody could see me, but there were other people in the hallway. So in our room, and then I decided to go back to the bathroom and I go to the wrong bathroom. I go to the men's room and there's this guy taking a shower in his clothes and everything. He doesn't even really notice me, so I'm okay. [laugh] And then I go back to our bathroom and things are kind of okay. Oh, and then I kind of got some clothes on and took a walk around, then I was coming up the stairs to go back to our room, and this lady comes up to see me and she's like, she gets on a portable radio and calls the audio man, Jon Onion -- his name is really Jon Bunyan, but they call him Jon Onion from the Dome -- and wants him to help me. Like that was strange, man. And then at the very end, before I woke up, I dreamt that my back was hurting really, really, really bad because I fell from _______ all around."
"B-264"	"#B-264 (2003-05-01 (18)) Originally I thought that this dream was way too silly to put on this tape, but now that I've had enough conscious time to mull it over, I think it'll be okay. Matter of fact, let me say that, first of all, this dream was the first one that I've ever thought was too silly to put on this tape. [laugh] Here's what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, Dad put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this like little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle (?), so I had to take this torch -- believe it or not -- the plastic end (?) -- this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn't light. It was starting to like get out of control and so I like threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn't go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and I had to like, it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more. I think I was trying to fix some kind of food for somebody, and I think somebody was coming to town, but I don't remember anything more."
"B-265"	"#B-265 (2003-05-05 (18)) I had kind of a silly dream last night with a lot of silly things that weren't really connected in any kind of way. But first I dreamt that I was at school and I was trying to go somewhere. And the elevator in the main building was like real small, only enough to fit like me and another person. And I was in it by myself, and I had to go up to the third floor. And I kind of had the notion that there were more floors than three, so I kept pushing 3 to get to go up higher, and then all of a sudden I realized that it was going up past the third floor and into the control room shaft and the little trap door thing on the roof kind of lifted up for a minute and then banged down. And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press 1 and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing -- kind of later when I was outside -- I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff. And I realized I was in Ms. Marcos's class, in her 5th period, and I didn't want to be caught dead in a math class for an extra period than I had to be, so I got up and I walked out, and then I went downstairs, and I think I was going to some kind of party, but I woke up before I could get there."
"B-266"	"#B-266 (2003-05-12 (18)) First of all, I dreamt that I was at school and it was kind of like one of my last dreams and we weren't doing much in class. And [laugh] we were all kind of hanging out and partying and having assemblies and stuff, and there was this show, movie-like type thing that I was going to go and see in the auditorium with Mom. It was going to be a combination of Celine Dion and a few other people singing and doing things and stuff. And one of the officiants in the VE specialist office -- I can't remember her name -- but it was Mrs. Bernard or somebody -- was going to show me a shorter way to get there. And she said that I had to go through the Teacher's Lounge and through some teachers' special areas that no other students could go. Well, when I started going through that area with her, it was like a long hallway and a tunnel and several twists and several little office areas to go through, and there was this sound system that was very quiet, but audible, and very keen and very thin and very blah -- no frequency band width to it whatsoever. And so, of course, just like the Dome, it was mixed with this ""buzzzzzzzzzz"" sound, and as you were walking through this hallway, you would hear the sound coming, there would be the speakers mounted -- some on the ceiling, some on the walls kinda of close to my waist height, and some on the floor. And you would be walking by and any time you would get near one of them, and you could feel the sound waves. It would just give your muscles these sensations, these shaky, jittery sensations and you'd like fall down and stuff, like when I walked under one, it gave me these like tingles down my spine and just made me shudder. And then I passed one at my waist height and it like almost made me fall down. And there was one -- I was coming up to one that was on the floor -- and I just kind of totally like freaked out. [laugh] And I can't remember exactly what I did, but this assistant just kind of was walking along ahead of me and this was normal, and who was I to think it wasn't. And I think that I forgot something out of my locker, and I had to go all the way back around, but I went the long way and I wasn't going to go the short way, so I went the long way again. And then I finally got to the auditorium and the show was like starting already. And there were bleachers in there and I was walking down these big bleacher things, and actually there were like bleachers on the side and everybody in the middle had like normal seats. And I was going to sit on like one of the big bleacher platforms up real close so I could see. But I got there and I sat down, and Celine Dion was like in these long leather pants and this black top like I have, and she was singing something -- I don't remember what -- and then in the middle of a song she like takes off her clothes in front everybody and changes into this black dress that's kind of to her knees. And nobody does anything, nobody in the video audience or the real audience does anything. They're just like, ""Okay, this is normal."" [laugh] You know, that's all I can remember. And I think there was some guy, like Michael Jackson who was singing too, and that's all. Obviously this was a spin-off on the Dome offices. It's just that my imagination went absolutely crazy because the Buxton House had a whole house system too, and, of course, theirs sounded nice, but now I hope I'm not going to have this dreadful memory every time I hear a whole house system like that. It's just that I had this dying curiosity of how they work and what makes them work and how they're wired and stuff. But when I don't know these things, it's kind of frightful. I don't know how to describe it. Especially when they make weird sounds and so weird things like that."
"B-267"	"#B-267 (2003-05-14 (18)) Lat night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that I was at school and they were having like this graduation fair party. And I was there with Melinda. And Mom was going to come and join me. And Mom went in the bathroom and said, ""I'll meet you guys outside."" And Melinda and I went to this classroom that was set up with little work stations, and they were supposed to be like audio work stations, but ours was kind of like bland because somebody stole our mixer board, and there was just this TV playing like video footage that somebody took with a camera. And Melinda and I are sitting there watching it because, you know, she thinks it's like really cool, and next thing I know I'm kind of falling asleep. And then I start getting really into it too, just watching everything that this person videotaped. And then all of a sudden, it didn't feel like too much longer but I realized it was three hours later, and the whole party was over and Mom was back to get us and find out what happened to us. And I was so mad that Mom didn't come and get us sooner, that she was in the car taking me home, I was screaming and yelling and whipping my purse out the window and like, ""Why wouldn't you come and get us? You made me miss the party!"" And I was so resentful that Melinda sat there, bored as anything, but she was watching that movie that I thought she thought was interesting and we missed all the rest of the goings-on that day. And so I don't know what that means, but that was kind of dumb."
"B-268"	"#B-268 (2003-05-22 (18)) Today is my graduation. Last night I had this very, this dream. It wasn't really that scary, but it probably was supposed to be, I don't know. It might have been set off by Dracula or it might have been set off by being with Sandra and Lee who are Christians. I don't know what it was, but I dreamt there was this really awful like monster's den, but what it was is you would go down this river, and if the current would pull you the wrong way, you would get down this tributary that after a while, once you got down further and further, it would be, there would be more and more monsters trying to get at you. And they would all be surrounding you and they would all be moving in for the kill, and there was no way that you would survive that. And the worst part was, after you died, just like in Dracula, you would become undead and you would become one of them. And I had my little subdreams. I like dreamt that I was awake, and then when I wasn't like awake, I dreamt that I was like involved in that. And I would always like wake up every time and be like in the first level of dream before it would really be like not real. And I dreamt that I like read in the newspaper that there was one way to get out of that, that was to ask Jesus for forgiveness and suddenly you would just be out of that river and back like on some sidewalk. And I don't remember too much more. I know there was a lot more, but, of course, I put off putting this on here."
"C-001"	"#C-001 (2003-05-27 (18)) I'm still having crazy dreams about the undead, from reading that Dracula book. The concept is supposed to be so scary and so horrible, which it kind of is, but it's more cool than anything, you know what I mean? So last night I dreamt that Sandra like came to me in my sleep and like laid down next to me, and somehow I had the notion that she was undead and she was like visiting me. And she wasn't going to, she didn't scare me, she wasn't going to take any of my blood, but I was going to like give her some so that she could like come back to life or something dumb like that. [laugh] And that's all that there is to it. I kind of faded into consciousness."
"C-002"	"#C-002 (2003-05-31 (18)) First of all, there were like several things to it. First of all I dreamt that I got several birthday presents, at this time of the year -- yes, birthday presents! Maybe because Terri gave me a late birthday card or something. One of them was this mechanical baby doll that like it was the form and the stature of a real person, of a full-grown person, but it acted like a baby doll. Its arms like would reach out to you and it would laugh and say, ""Mama"" and stuff like that. And if it was turned on, it would just do that periodically at any time. And Dad was like, ""That thing! How are you ever going to get any sleep?"" But he didn't realize that all you had to do is turn it off and it wouldn't do that any more. And I thought it was a really special gift from somebody, I don't remember who. Then I dreamt that I was studying media in college and I needed something to help me study it, and Dad and I went to this electronics store to get one and the one, the Peavey one that we were looking at was really, really good. It was kind of a mixer and bat kind of combined into one unit. And then there was this other one that was even better [laugh] and this was the funniest part. The Peavey one that we were looking at spanned three octaves, but this other one spanned like six octaves, and so Dad wanted me to have the Peavey one, but he wanted the store person to cut the other one in half and attach the half to the Peavey one and make it one unit. [laugh] I don't get that! And the store owner said, ""Well, there's a much easier solution. We have a larger Peavey model."" And so we ended up getting the larger Peavey model. And then I dreamt that I was working for the baseball team, and not like a DJ but to do like paperwork and stuff. And I had a desk in their offices, and somehow -- I don't remember how -- but I must've put it on my desk. And there was this other girl who had a desk next to me who was studying video and stuff also, and we decided we were going to like hear it, and then I can't remember, but I was off running errands for them or something, and I come back and somehow somebody had talked me into just giving it to her, and getting another one with my gift card, and so I had this nice, perfect model and when I got back to my desk it wasn't there. And then I like rolled around or something like that and then I woke up. And then I was like half conscious, but having other little tiddly dreams but keeping that thought in mind that, I don't know. Then I woke up. I have a little bit more of an explanation about the baby doll part of this dream, now that I've been thinking about it. When I was little, I had two kind of small talking baby dolls. One was supposed to be a boy and one was supposed to be a girl. One was from Brittany and Roxanne and one was from Aunt Peggy. And they would laugh and they would say, ""Mama,"" but they wouldn't like reach out to you or anything. And I think, oh, I know what, when their batteries kind of ran down, they talked like this [low stretched-out voice] and they sounded like an old man, kind of like my tape sometimes. And that was just so weird. [laugh] I think I might have been thinking about that."
"C-003"	"#C-003 (2003-06-02 (18)) I was at this youth center place, kind of like Club Saturday, but they were having this like workshop thing and I can't remember exactly what it was. But I was in this room, like a dance studio, and Samantha and me and Mom and this strange instructor person were in there, and they were showing me a trumpet, of all things [laugh] and they wanted me to just try it out and see how it felt. And I could feel the finger things and I remembered when -- I don't know -- it was just weird. [laugh] And then we went out to this main like cafeteria area and there was a, it was empty and there was a piano in there and some girl was like playing. And I was like walking through there to get out to the door to go out, and the instructor person who was with us gave me this little book, thumbnail size book of songs. And then when I got out to the car, Dad and somebody else were there to pick us up, but I realized that I left my MD machine in the room, so I had to get out and run back in. By this time the cafeteria was full of people, and noisy students. So I went back and got my machine and then I went, then we went to this like funeral thing, I guess for like James's father, and I was kind of perplexed because we said we weren't going to go. And somehow I got separated from everybody else and I was like sitting behind the first row and I was watching the thing going on. Then when it ended, everybody kind of got up and left and I was like left in there. And I got up and I started walking. There was this big, long and there was this big complex at the funeral center, and as I got up and I started walking, there was like this bridge over the pool, and so I walked over that and I started to cross the front lawn. And then this lady came out and stopped me and said that this path was going to lead me into private property because there were condos over there. And she was going to lead me like back to the parking lot. And so she led me to this path that had these sprinkler heads sticking up that you could trip over at any minute, and we were walking along this path and suddenly they came on and sprayed all over us. And then we got to this like little clearing area deep in the woods and somehow Mom found us and found out where I was and went back to the car and told everybody. And I don't remember ever getting back there. I woke up before I got back."
"C-004"	"#C-004 (2003-06-04 (18)) We had taken a car trip up to California to see Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird -- you'd never believe it.

And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can't remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don't remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that -- oh, I know -- somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Uncle Charlie and Uncle Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Uncle Charlie how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them like came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door.

But I couldn't find any of them to show her. And somehow I dreamt that I had the notion that I was at school and time to get out so that I could get to the parking lot where they were going to pick me up. Well, at school the halls were like flooding and they had water up to my ankles, and I took my shoes off so that they wouldn't get all wet, but from taking off my shoes I couldn't keep my balance as well, and there wasn't much more to it."

So I sat down on this railing to this stairwell and I was taking stuff out of my purse that I didn't need, like this vitamin bottle with one vitamin in it and these papers and stuff, and I called Mom on the cell phone and she couldn't really tell me a lot. And she was there like within two or three minutes of me calling, and she was saying that I should try to meet up with Mrs. Hollander's group but I didn't know where they were, and I think they had left already.

What it was, was when there's a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don't know where we would get that from. I didn't remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, ""Oh, how neat!"" Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC 110 to DC 12, and once it was in DC 12 mode, 12 volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else.

And I was back at Westport High School, or Westport College -- I couldn't figure out which one it was. And she was helping me find my room numbers for next year's classes. I think it was Latisha from the Wilcox Center. And she was showing me where my psychology class is, but she said that if I go too far to one side, past the psychology class, I would be in the Special Ed Department and there were all kinds of whackos in there that I didn't want to be around. And so she advised me to go around one way to get to the other thing. And then we met up with Samantha and Derek, who had driven down, I guess, and Latisha kind of turned me over to them and went about her away. And Samantha and Derek and I were trying to find an elevator to get down and we found one. We got down and out to this like pool area, and it looked like the pool was outside, but I guess it really wasn't, because it was an echoey echo chamber around there. And I can't remember if I wanted to get in and swim or not, but I remember that it was an echoey echo chamber. And Derek went in there started walking around and around the perimeter of the pool, saying, ""It collapsed, it collapsed, it collapsed! The World Trade Center collapsed!"" And this was kind of upsetting Samantha, but she didn't want to show it. [laugh] I mean, this is totally off the wall, but that's what he did in my dream. And then we got back in the car for some reason, and we were going to go home, and Samantha was like laying in my lap and crying. She was like the size of me and I could like support her, and her legs were like falling on the floor. I could support her body. And she had dark hair like me. And, but I knew she wasn't me; she was Samantha. And then we kept driving, and then Derek was talking about next time maybe that Mom can run him down. And about that time I woke up."
"C-014"	"#C-014 (2003-07-04 (18)) I didn't remember it very clearly this morning, but as the day went on, it became clearer. That is very unusual because most of the time it works the other way around. First I dreamt that me and Astrid were like playing with toys, like we were kids. We were winding up all of our dolls and our animals and things and we were making a parade the way I used to do when I was little. And she was listening to like a personal CD player. And she was lining up some baby dolls and stuff. And her mother came back and told us we should totally stop that because that's immature; that's like kids' behavior. And then I woke up. And then I went back to sleep and I had another dream that Samantha and Derek were in town and Derek was using this audio program that's different from Digital Performer, but it was kind of similar. Mom had her own machine just like mine in her work room and her monitor was up on her high boy dresser. And I was like kneeling up on the stool, so that I could see it, and Derek had composed this rap thing with MIDI, and I was going to like go over it and sing some melody, like Ashanti sings for Javol (?) and Beyonce sang for JV (?). I was going to do that for Derek and his rap. I was like trying to do this and it like wasn't working right, and I had to close out and shut down, but I woke up before I could do it."
"C-015"	"#C-015 (2003-07-05 (18)) This was the night that Astrid slept over. I had _____________ what am I talking about? And I dreamt that something was going on in my studio while Astrid was sleeping and Mom was in her work room doing something. And I was doing something in my studio, like the sound, and I guess I kind of got turned on. And I don't know how -- she didn't see me -- but I think Mom found out, and she was telling me, ""It's too rough over there; why don't you do that in bed, because Astrid's blind and she won't be able to even see you."" And [laugh] I'm glad I woke up. That was just so ridiculous! [laugh]"
"C-016"	"#C-016 (2003-07-06 (18)) I can't remember what we were doing, but we were going to have some kind of party at the house. And the, we had to have the amplifier receiver in the freezer. We had to have it centrally located there in order for it to work right, and it wasn't big like big and bulky; it was small, it was the size of the microphone bass thing. And I think there was this singing group that was coming to the house, and again Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town. And they were going to have like a party on the porch. And we had like an outside system set up on the porch, and I couldn't, we couldn't get the sound system to work right, so Mom was working feverishly putting the food together and I was like opening the freezer door and messing with the receiver. I changed the selector from A to B so that it would be on the outside system on the porch, and meanwhile while I'm trying to do this to get it to work right, Mom's like yelling to me that she needs me to help her with the food, and she's like taking my trip and almost tripping me. And I told her I can't do that now, I've got to do this, and I think she finally got the picture. And I finally got it to work right for them, and [laugh] it took me a little while to understand which CD they wanted cued up because to me they all sounded the same, by this singing group that was kind of a bland version of the Spice Girls. And, let's see, I think -- oh, that's it."
"C-017"	"#C-017 (2003-07-11 (18)) I was back at Westport High School and I was in the Media Center where there's three stories. And to get to from one to two wasn't hard, it was normal. But from two to get to three, I guess two was like extra tall and three was like up near the ceiling. You had to climb this monumental amount of stairs. And when we would ride the elevator to get to one, to two wouldn't be too bad; that would be normal. But to get to three, it would take forever and a day, and sometimes it wouldn't even go up to three or wouldn't work right. And we'd be nervous about getting stuck. So I would just prefer to climb the monumental amount of stairs and work up there slowly but surely, dragging my book bag and everything. I remember doing that once, and then going kind of down an incline to get to the main building, and then I think there was a cat walk between that building and somewhere else. And I had to go down to get something. I had to talk to Ms. Garland or somebody, so I took the elevator down and then came back up. But then I dreamt that we were at this like little park thing that you could go out and be in. There were swans and ducks and pigs and things, and it was like a manmade park, but these birds just lived in there. And we would feed them and stuff. And they did these like shows, but I never got to see any of them. And I don't remember anything more. Oh, and I remember the swans were real aggressive. They would come down and lick people, and then I don't remember any more."
"C-018"	"#C-018 (2003-07-15 (18)) I was back at this place that was kind of, it kind of reminded me of like the Wilcox Center auditorium except it had a stage, and the room was kind of dark except for some stage lighting that was kind of bluish and a yellowish-whitish spotlight kind of in the middle of the room. And there was like a dance party going on, except the sound system was kind of low and it wasn't really all that loud. But there was cluddy techno going on, and I was with Astrid and Linda and there were some families and parents and things there. And there were some like bleacher seats, as though we were at the Eastport Bayfront Center or something like that. But there was this big open foyer for us to dance around and then there was a stage. And I would be like, I would meet Astrid and Linda around, and then I would leave them with some other people and then I would go mingle around with some other people and then I was going to just dance. And they kind of toned it down a little and they were getting ready to do this show. And what it consisted of was this animal trainer person who was there, and had an alligator that was like almost twice the size of a chichahua dog and he was on a leash and they were walking him around the stage. And all of us people from the Wilcox Center had to line up and walk up on stage and go by and pet the alligator and say something to it. [laugh] This is getting so bizarre! And then everybody was suddenly dressed like so nice. Somebody was in this like blue jacket and this black dress and everybody else was in like black dresses, and I couldn't figure out where I was going to be in line and I like wasn't even going to do this show thing. And Randy's yelling at me from the back of the room, ""Jasmine, go to the back of the room."" And then some other volunteers kind of helped me find my place. And before I could get up to the stage to the alligator, I kind of faded into another scene. I was in my studio and Terri was over working on my machine. And I had two monitors because what were supposed to be able to do is work from the PC and the Mac at the same time with the same mouse, but two keyboards and two monitors. And I can't remember what I was doing, but I was doing some kind of a script or something for that show. I was doing the audio and DP and the typing in Word all at once, and Terri was helping me. And then I just faded into consciousness."
"C-019"	"#C-019 (2003-07-19 (18)) I was already starting college and it was my first day of classes. And I was heading to my psychology class in the Social Arts Building and in my dream it was a lot shorter. It was almost a portable almost. And I was trying to, well, first of all before any of this, the DART cab was coming to pick me up, and I had to run back to the house to get something and I was carrying my Wilcox Center bag in my other hand, and it was so heavy, and I kept tripping and falling and tripping and falling. When I finally got back to the house I asked Mom for some money so I could pay the guy and she gave me some. And then I was there and the security guard stopped me and was talking and talking and I was late for class, and I went up to this portable that was supposedly the Social Arts Building and there was like this little doggie door that was like the first door that I could get in. And I like opened and it and it went, ""Squeak"" real loud and then I just closed it and I stood outside. And when the teacher came out a regular door, and he was like, ""Come on in and sit down. This is the first day, and I've had a lot of people late today. Just come in and sat down."" And so I did. And there was this assistant that was sitting by me, like Melinda would, and this assistant kind of reminded me of Randy. The teacher and the assistant kind of seemed to be doubles of each other, and doubles of this stranger person that was kind of like Randy. And they were talking about these chant songs and these songs with these sounds and these words in them, and the words were like all jumbled and we had to kind of make something of them. And there was this one that was like, ""Leah, Leah, __________"" -- they kept screaming that name, and other students in the class were talking about how in that culture that Leah was a higher spirit, a higher power that they were chasing. And the teacher passed out a packet of papers, it was like a booklet of these different words and what they meant, and his assistant was prodding me to go over to a CC TV and look at it and read what it says, so I could ______ with the rest of them. And I was kind of feeling like I shouldn't bother because I could always look at it at home and I should just listen now. And then I kind of started to fade into consciousness, and I realized, ""Hey, this is only a dream. It's only July 18th or 19th. I don't have to study yet."" And that's when I kind of went back to sleep and faded into the dark."
"C-020"	"#C-020 (2003-07-21 (18)) I was still at Westport High School and I was carrying a bunch of stuff. I was carrying my book bag and one or two or three other heavy bags of stuff. And I dreamt that I was at this meeting to plan the prom that was supposed to be August 10th. Now isn't that ludicrous! I can't remember any kind of details, but there was a regular school bus that was going to take me home with a bunch of other people, and this meeting kept me talking and talking, and I missed the bus, so I had to call Mom and Dad and they came and they picked me up. But before they got here, I think I had to go back through the school and back into the courtyard and around because I forgot something, and then I came and I can't remember any more. Now isn't that stupid?"
"C-021"	"#C-021 (2003-07-25 (18)) I was starting college again except this time I dreamt that I was starting my basics recording class and it's called Music and Computers. And I dreamt that starting the class we were going to start in a regular classroom and do a little bit of study on theory. And I don't remember too much except there were these things that some black girl copied off the board for me, and I could hardly read her handwriting, but I did recognize this formula that was kind of weird, and I couldn't put my finger on it right at the moment, but then I thought about it and I decided that that formula was the formula for finding the frequency of a note. And then I think -- I can't remember what we were doing -- everybody was kind of at a place that had a regular desk and then some other stuff. And for whatever reason, right at that moment I was out of class and I was setting up the Peavey system in this big open foyer because somebody was going to have a wedding or a party or some kind of a reception. And I turned it on kind of low, I thought it sounded from behind, but I guess from the front it was a little louder. Up in the balcony there was this guy that was yelling at me to turn it down some. And while I was like on the floor in this big open wooden floor, huge area rug room and there was these balconies all around, I guess kind of like the rotunda at the Dome except it was square and it had a wooden floor, but the acoustics were the same. And then, once it was on and I was kind of playing some easy listening stuff, I got word that the party had been like postponed for an hour or so, so I shut everything down and I was back with the class and we were going up this set of stairs to this band room. We weren't really in a line, we weren't going in any kind of order. We were just clumsily traipsing up the stairs. And this lady -- Irene Doppley or something like that -- I don't know who she was, but she pulled me aside and she gave me this present. And I was home in my studio and I opened it, and it was this inline amplifier that's supposed to make a signal from a microphone or instrument stronger with a little bit of effect before it goes like to a main house system. And it was like a little bigger than this tape machine. So that was really bizarre. [laugh]"
"C-022"	"#C-022 (2003-07-27 (18)) I was in college again, but they were treating us like babies. There was this one woman teacher who had maybe fifteen or twenty of us that she had to take around to a various number of classes and we had all our classes together. And we had six periods a day, just like in high school. And fifth and sixth period we could go to by ourselves, but first through fourth we had to follow behind her in a line and she would leave us with these teachers and then come and check back with us. I think that was kind of a development from the Wilcox Center. This one class was supposed to be -- I can't remember why -- but in my dream I couldn't really stand up right. I had weak muscles and I kept wanting to let my head just drop to in front of my chest, and I couldn't hold my shoulders up straight. And the teacher dropped us off. We were in this big foyer, kind of like the Wilcox Center auditorium, and this professor was, I think it was Dr. Stephenson from Westport College, and he was leading this chorus of people a little young than me singing, ""_____________"" and so on and I wanted to go and join with them, so I came to the front of the line and the front of the like block of people and I stood. And again, I was having trouble holding myself up straight, and that one teacher kept coming over to me and tipping my head up and like straightening my shoulders and I just could not hold them up straight. Then, as we were singing and breathing and learning the song, the floor became more bouncing and more trampoline-y and more like a mattress, and it got bouncier and bouncier, the more we did. It became kind of like a moon walk thing almost, but it still looked the same. And when I tried to stand the way you're supposed to stand when your stand -- feet next to each other, everything in alignment -- I just could not stand; I would keep falling down. So I had to stand with one foot in front and one foot in back a little ways. Then I could sort of stay up for a little longer, but I would still fall down. And I don't remember too much more."

The next thing I knew this person came to the house, and I realized it was her and she was kind of short and kind of fat and she had short, dark hair. And she was wearing this tee shirt with like writing and stuff all over it. And she was kind of blah, she was kind of sarcastic like Terri is. And I would say things like how great it was to meet her, and how this is so exciting, and she would just laugh and kind of like ""Everybody says that."" And then we had a slow dance together, and I just couldn't stop crying because I was so touched. She did actually say something nice through her sarcasm, I can't remember what it was. But I was just so touched, and I don't remember anything else. ... in my album there was this line that goes, ""I can't believe it ___________ to me"" [singing] -- and part of it was a little flat and a little off key, so I figured I would highlight that area and try to transpose it and try to fine tune it by maybe 30 cents or something like that. Well [laugh] somehow it kinda got all whacked out and it just went totally off the wall, and then it sounded like [singing again] , ""Oh, I can't believe __________"" and it sounded like a tape that was wearing out.

It was very vague. And then, since the VCR wasn't working and we couldn't watch the movie, then I decided I was going to set up the mixer board and stuff, and I like, I think I dropped a glass tube of some kind and it shattered all over the floor.

And you would go through and you would get some pizza and you'd get some other finger foods, and then you'd go in this ____________ for your drink. Well, I think for a minute Doug turned into Dad and he got me this like sushi soup type of stuff, and I was ""Yuk"" when I had my eyes on some pizza or some chicken fingers or something like that, and I didn't even have time to get a drink.

Then I came back to the school and was helping out with the awards ceremony, and then we were out in the bus lane waiting for this city charter bus to come and pick us up and take us all home, kind of like when we were at the Wilcox Center waiting for our cabs. So we were all at this bus lane, this girl named Astrid was showing me her award and telling me about various things, and then the city bus comes and I get right in front for some reason, and it's going to take us all home just like a school bus would, except it's not. All of a sudden the cell phone rings and it's Mom and Dad wanting to know why it's 4:00 o'clock and we're not home yet, and I told them all the things I've been doing and it's impolite to make a call on the cell phone during the assembly. And so, of course, that didn't go over too well. So I got home and sitting at the dining table and Dad's asking me to explain why I didn't call sooner and all. And I'm sitting there and I'm at this placemat thing that ______ for papers and we ran out of them, sitting there typing with my fingers as though there were a keyboard there, but there wasn't, just a placemat.

And I dreamt that, you know how they want me to have mobility and all, I dreamt that I was going to say that I forgot my cane, because I really did, but my motive for going back to the house and getting it was to get my CD player, which I forgot also. [laugh] And I dreamt that this hotel was kind of pretty ornate. I don't remember too much because it was a few days ago. And there was something else really interesting a few days ago, but, of course, I forgot. We've just been running and running and running and I have this dumb prepaid legal tape that I'm recording over, so I guess it can just run on and on and on, and it's like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Now I remember what I was going to say before. A couple nights ago I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School again and I was preparing for this school-sponsored trick-or-treat thing for kids, and I had boxes of like food and candy and stuff in my book bag, and it was all on a dolly, like a cart thing, that I was ready to just wheel down the elevator and go off to where I needed to go. I was like upstairs in front of the Guidance Office. So I had Angel watch it so that nobody would mess with it while I went to go get some things out of my locker and go do a couple other things. So I'm doing a couple other things and then I come back and all the stuff is gone off the dolly cart thing, and Mom is upstairs in front of the Guidance Office with her bicycle with all the boxes on it. And Angel's like, ""I stole your book bag"" and she like threw it at me, you know, like they do sometimes. And I think Mom and I were going to go off to where we needed to go on the bicycle, but I don't know how we were going to get down the stairs. And then I woke up."
"C-033"	"#C-033 (2003-08-17 (18)) To start with I don't know if I was up here or back home, but I was at this bar with Mom and a few other people, I think one or two of my friends too. And there was this machine there, this vending machine, that you would put a quarter in and you would put a square, rectangular piece of bendy plastic in. It was like three dimensional. And then the machine would play a tune like ""Old MacDonald"" or ""London Bridge"" or some kids' song like that, while it was making the kid a figure. And it had like a little window where you could watch it through. And I can't remember, it wasn't scary, but the machine played ""London Bridges"" and ""Bluebird"" and a couple other things like that, but some of them I couldn't recognize. And I don't know what that had to do with anything, but I also, at this bar I was supposed to set up the sound system and do something, record something, I guess. And I didn't have the Peavey system; I had this big clunky thing. And somehow I made a recording with my voice talking over some music that's playing and making some announcements and stuff. And later on I played it back on my personal CD player. And it was so loud, my voice was like clipping, and I couldn't turn the volume down. It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle. [laugh] And that was kind of crazy. And so I figured, ""Next time I have got to pay more attention to the V meters, and they had these racks of equipment and they had a tape recorder, a CD recorder and a couple other things like the radio station does. And I had to stand on a chair and I still couldn't see all the meters well enough. So then I kind of woke and went to a different scene. Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that Dad came up here. He drove up here [laugh] and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Burt did at the farm that one day. But it wasn't a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, ""Oh no, he's going to be tagging along with us the next week and he's going to rain on our parade."" And he also saying things like, ""Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You shouldn't have to fly home. We should all drive home together."" And I was like, ""Oh no,"" that's the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I'm so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it's like boring when it's just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we didn't use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home. And then I woke up, fortunately. Let's see, I'm trying to remember."
"C-034"	"#C-034 (2003-08-24 (18)) I'm back from my trip, but I dreamt that I was still on my trip. First of all, the weirdest part, I dreamt that Melinda had this car that had this alarm thing that she didn't know how to shut off, or else she couldn't turn off unless she was going something like 50 or 60 miles an hour, so I think I was in Mr. Jameson's PE locker room again. I keep having dreams about stuff like back at Westport High School, and I don't understand it. So I was in Mr. Jameson's locker room waiting for Melinda to pick me up, but yet I'm still on my trip. I don't understand this notion. [laugh] And there was like this indoor race track thing that Melinda was going to drive by and kick me up and go. And the thing of it was, she had to go as fast as she could and I had to jump in as fast as I could so that we could get to the 50 or so miles an hour she needed to shut the alarm off. That sounds like a movie to me. [laugh] And so I'm waiting there and I don't really remember her ever, I heard the car with the alarm going on because she had to slow down a little to get into the race track thing, and I like grabbed onto the door and like jumped in and slammed the door and we raced off. And I think we were going kind of slow, but she finally got the alarm to shut off. I couldn't move around or anything. And then I dreamt that I was back in that locker room, and I had these pants, of all things, these pants that had an alarm on them. [laugh] And how it would get activated is if you would touch the end of the belt strap to the belt buckle, that would complete some kind of circuit and it wouldn't go off until you had the belt actually buckled. That was weird! Then I can't remember -- oh, I was at either Aunt Christine's house or Uncle Larry's house -- I can't remember which house. And we had all these aunties visiting us. And Dad was supposed to ride up on his bike any minute, I think, and come join the visiting party. And for whatever reason, I had a portable two-way radio, not in my pocket but literally stuffed down into my pants. I don't know why, but I didn't have to be actually keying the transmitter. There was this Auntie Lovely, Mom called her, who had another one, and supposedly was listening in on everything we were saying, and I didn't actually have to be keying the transmitter to let her hear what was going on; it just transmitted by itself. And then, when we were sitting there visiting, Uncle Larry was setting up the boombox and just as he was setting it up, this Auntie Lovely lady is talking to me through the unit, and it's real, real loud, and she's saying that she's almost there and she's going to be here real soon, and not to cut the cake without her or something. And I was thinking, ""Oh gosh, how embarrassing."" And I was hoping that they couldn't tell it was actually me. I was hoping that they could just feel that the sound was like in the air or something. So I figure, ""I have got to do something."" So I came in and I went into the bathroom, and I was going to like turn the volume down or turn that thing off or something, but then I kind of drifted into another scene. And this scene was that Mom and I had our car to drive up in Jackson and I had made a CD of the blue Wee Sing tape with the ""Bluebird"" song and everything on it. And for whatever reason, I had heard it three times earlier in the week and I wanted to play it again while we were driving around town. And so we did, and we were playing ""London Bridges"" and ""Bluebird"" and all those other things while we were driving through town. And it wasn't scary or anything. It was just that there were other relatives in the car and I didn't want them thinking that I was a baby by wanting to play that. And I think shortly thereafter I faded into consciousness. Oh no, I didn't. There was more to it. Oh my gosh, this goes on and on and on. I'm going to use up this tape. I dreamt that after driving all around and stuff, going home was just like a bicycle ride away, and so Mom and I were going to just ride the thing home. [laugh] And we sat out there talking to Aunt Christine for another hour as if we really didn't want to go home, but we knew we had to. And it was like 11:00 o'clock at night and we were still talking. And she gave us a blanket and a sheet and a little portable boombox machine that was actually like a kids' thing that was shaped like a bunny rabbit. And Mom stuffed it in her bicycle basket and then we started bicycling home in the night. And that's -- oh, and I didn't wake up yet. I dreamt that we got home and I was squished between Mom and Mrs. Dougherty on our porch swing, and we were telling her about her trip and some of the things that happened. And that's when I woke up finally. Oh, that was just so weird. [laugh] I mean, I can't even begin to sort it out. I mean, I think, they always say that the subconscious is nowhere near as bridled as the conscious mind. I think my conscious mind is severely ridiculing my subconscious for coming up with such weird whacko ideas. [laugh] But, you know, there must be a factor going on in me somewhere that I need to pay attention to, I mean, as bizarre it may be. One other thing, I don't remember too much about the dream I was having last night, not last night but the night before when I slept downstairs on the air mattress, but I do remember, you know that thing that Mr. Romane taught us in 4th grade? It goes, ""Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?"" That was a little song that he taught us, and he wanted us to move our hands up and down according to the intervals of the notes, and that, for whatever reason, kind of scared me -- not in the dream, but in the class that he taught it to us did. And moving my hands up and down according to the notes made it feel worse because I couldn't put my hands how I normally put them when something scares me like that. And in my dream a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was in a public bathroom and they were playing that over the intercom, and it wasn't too much of a thing, but it was a little thing. And so I think half awake and half asleep, I turned over the way that I do. But I got the worst back ache and I realized that on that mattress it's not good for me to lay like that. That was crazy!"
"C-035"	"#C-035 (2003-08-26 (18)) I was in this elevator with Melinda and a couple people from the Wilcox Center. It was really big, and had these glass windows kind of like the ones from the pier. And I had the notion that we had to get to the 14th floor of this building and we were kind of stuck, and we had to kind of ride up and down for a little while until somebody called it from the 14th floor and got it to open. And down below there were these people bouncing balls in a courtyard. We were looking through the elevator windows and we saw. And I kind of shifted to another scene that I was like with the transition people, and I had these raw cucumber slices and I like put them up against my eyes and kind of squinted to hold them there, to get kind of goofy like they do in the cartoons, because I used to do stuff like that when I was little. And they got so offended, thinking that I was making fun of myself and people who had terminal legal blindness. And I don't know where all that came from. It was small, but it was kind of crazy. So anyway, I think I did a pretty good job of filling up this tape. For once I will have timed it so that I'm done when it's done. Now I can finally take off that little piece of scotch tape that I put on the one side to let me record over this ""blah, blah, blah"" tape, and I can take the tape off and it'll just be a regular tape. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. [laugh]"
"C-036"	"#C-036 (2003-09-05 (18)) This morning I just had a bizarre kind of dream. Well, first of all, at night I dreamt that I was walking in a park and doing some kind of stuff with Mom and Dad, and I had this thing -- I don't remember what it was -- but then my thing came on to wake me and I was hearing the dove while I proceeded on with this dream of mine. And then I was still asleep and dreaming, but I felt that I was laying here in my bed. And, as I was dreaming, essentially I was asleep, but I didn't know it, so I was dreaming that my hand could reach over and change it to 104.7 like I like to hear in the morning. But since I was sleeping, I had that tactile sensation, but I really wasn't doing it, so I didn't hear any audio feedback that that was happening. And I was sleeping still. I didn't actually physically get up, but in my dream I did. I got up and I looked at it, and it was even showing me the numbers of where it was going instead of the time. But I just didn't hear it because it was still on the dove and I was still .... [end]"
"C-037"	"#C-037 (2003-09-15 (18)) What was I going to say? Oh, I get a little flustered sometimes; can you tell? This is a tape that used to be something boring that came in the mail that had a Braille label and I managed to rip it off, and I used this tape for me and ____ to goof around, as you could hear at the beginning. And so now I've got ample space left and I can't bear to just waste it, so I'm going to use it for some more dreams. I had the neatest one last night. First of all, let me start off like this, this is one of the bizarre parts. I dreamt that Celine's song, ""Prayer"" [she sings part of it] it starts off and the two verses go on just like they're supposed to, but in my dream there was no third verse and that magical key chain that she does in most of her songs. It was a car commercial in place of it. Can you believe it? And that's how I dreamt that it was recorded, and there was just nothing, it was like a big disappointment. And then I dreamt that I can't remember where I was or what I was doing -- but I was at this building -- I think it was a school or an office building or something; I can't remember what. But I needed to get on this elevator, and it was kind of a scary one because the building was twelve stories and I needed to go up to the 10th floor, so I hit #10 and we got there surprisingly fast. And I can't even remember what I was doing. Come to think of it, I think it was the Dome. I had to get up to the very top to do something with the sound board or something. And so I was at #10 and then I needed to get back down because I left my papers with the receptionist. And I got in the elevator and I needed to go ten stories down, and I hit #10 and I didn't grab the railing, and it just started to drop rapidly. And it's one of those things where you feel like you're falling and your reflexes make you physically jump and sometimes make you wake up. Well, I didn't wake up, but I felt myself jump, and I grabbed the railing and then I was okay, but it was like, ""Ahhhhh,"" free-fall. And that was really scary because I could feel myself getting closer and closer to the ceiling and then grabbed the railing and then I was okay. So I got down, and I had the feeling like the door wasn't going to open immediately, but it did. And you know what was fascinating, there was so much more to do, but I can't remember. I let the day get away from me because I was putting this off."
"C-038"	"#C-038 (2003-09-22 (18)) We'd just come home from our trip and last night I had a bizarre dream. I was in a bunk bed, if that had any effect on anything. First of all, I dreamt that I had to retake my AP test, and it wasn't the Spanish test; it was more of a test of the usage of English grammar and spelling, but mainly on what words had certain implications. And for some reason I had the notion that that test brought on a lot of feelings of pain and sadness and fear and all like that in me because in my dream I had the notion that I took the test a few years ago and I think I missed a question or two or three, and somebody who was giving the test wanted to give me a chance to redo it. And it was on a pink sheet of paper, but I had to put my new answers on the white sheet, just these three questions. And on the pink sheet were a couple of multiple choice questions at the top. Then, you know how Spanish verb conjugations have six lines going vertically down? Well, on these six lines, there were three sets of six lines, and on the first set of six lines I had to write, ""Oh, do you know the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man? Oh do you know the Muffin Man that lives on Dreary Lane?"" And on the next set of lines I had to write, ""Oh yes, I know the Muffin Man,"" and on and on. And on the last set I had to write, ""Now we all know the Muffin Man."" And I think there were one or two other things like that, and I had the notion that you were supposed to spell ""do"" like, ""Do you know the Muffin Man"" ""d-e-w"" [laugh] and I was going to have something major wrong on the test because I didn't spell it that way, but I wasn't sure, so I left it. And I answered a few of the multiple choice questions about certain words, but they were like whacko questions. I can't remember them exactly, but it asked about the odd meaning of odd words with kind of a strange implication factor. And I dreamt that I was telling somebody that having to finish that test brought back a lot of pain that I felt when I took the test that I all forgot about. And it wasn't necessarily just a fear, but it was a fear-sadness type of a thing. And I don't know what all that's about; that was weird. But somehow I felt, I woke up in the middle of the night because the air conditioner was too cold, and then I went back to sleep, and dreamt that it was Halloween and it was 5:00 o'clock in the evening. I had no candy to give out except for a little bag. I had no sound system on the porch because Mom kept putting off and putting off getting on her bike and going to get some candy from the supermarket. Dad was putting off and putting off going to the garage and fixing the Peavey system. So I dreamt that not only did I have to set up the Peavey system and all its parts, but I had to set up the CD thing and the wireless mic and everything all in about ten minutes, and I was feeling really, really overwhelmed. And there were these two teenage boys already ding-donging the doorbell and trick-or-treating. And I just barely had something to give them and a few decorations out. And then that was that. I faded into another scene that I was re-recording over the lullaby tape because the last song had accompaniment but no words. And I dreamt that I could just put the tape in and hit ""record"" and the recorder would automatically mix the new increment signal with the old. And it was a song that goes, [singing] ""Golden slumber then you'll rise, ________ away to ________. Sleep pretty baby, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby."" But anyway, I was re-recording that and then I faded into consciousness. I sort of had the notion that I had really don that, and I was realizing that I should have first copied the tape sound track accompaniment onto a CD RW, then mixed it with my mixer with my voice and recorded that mix onto the tape, not just the voice. And somehow I had the notion that that was all correlated, and the taking the test thing really had an impact on me. I mean, I didn't really feel it, but I sort of did. And I wondered have I taken any tests lately that have had some subtle implications that have blocked some subconscious things on, or what's the deal here? So that's that. I'm using up tape like crazy, I'm sure."
"C-039"	"#C-039 (2003-09-24 (18)) I was at Memorial Stadium, supposed to do a DJ thing, but I was kind of lost and wasn't sure where I was. And I dreamt that I was on the opposite of the field from where I usually am. I'm usually at Gate 1, but this time I was on the side that has the sound booth, that was like about Gate 4, and it was kind of scary, not in the ""whoo"" fear sense, but in the sense that orientatively scared, and that I was like at this concession stand and I had to go up, but for a minute I was perched at the very tippy top, the absolutely toppest seat that you can have in the actual ball field area. I think it was the 5th or 6th floor, and there was a railing and I was looking down. And it's not very often that I'm afraid of heights because I look down, but that time I looked down and I was like, ""How the heck did I get up here?"" And I was thinking how somehow the gates were going to open in five minutes, and the equipment was supposed to be set up around Gate, and I had to get there in five minutes, and I was at this tippy top seat. And I didn't have any CD's with me, and I was trying to think of some excuse how to get them to lend me some of theirs. Like, for example, that I didn't know I was supposed to be here today or something dumb like that. And before I could even do any of this, I woke up."
"C-040"	"#C-040 (2003-09-25 (18)) I'm not sure how much tape I have left, so I guess I'll have to be prepared to stop when I hear the thing coming to the end, and then start my sentence over again when it auto-reverses. Anyway, I had a kind of a blah dream last night. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, Dad had this mission to do somewhere up in the middle of the state. I think it was a medical thing. And he was going to leave -- I think it was Thursday -- and he was going to leave in the middle of the night and he was going to be gone Friday, Saturday and Sunday and he was going to be coming home sometime on Monday night. And while he was gone Mom and I and everybody -- it was kind of understood that Mom and I were going to go up to Modern Media College (?) by ourselves [laugh] and have a tour there. And get this -- Samantha, Sandra and Derek were going to meet us there. [laugh] And we were all going to come home and have a big house party at home. And I think they were going to hang around for the week, but I can't remember. They might have been going to be gone by the time we got home, I can't remember. But it was some party that we were really looking forward to. And so I think it was that he left in the middle of the night, and then it was the next day, and early Friday morning he was home. And for some reason, I can't remember why, the trip for us to Modern Media College was off, and we communicated to Samantha, Sandra and Derek that they should come meet us down in Westportrsburg instead. And they weren't supposed to get here until Saturday afternoon. Well, you know, Dad has to be thinking about every single thing. He was starting to do a lot of that around the house, and I was thinking, ""Why the heck are you home so soon anyway?"" And I couldn't wait for Samantha, Sandra and Derek to get here, but I woke up before they did. And also in this dream, again before any of this happened, I dreamt that we were watching this spoof on the Mermaid movie, and there was this part to it that I never saw before. It was like telling some of the historical aspects of some of the characters that I never knew, like I guess some of Eric's friends. And Eric's friends were Arabic, and I dreamt that Eric was Arabic like Aladdin is. I guess the media is taking over. And I guess the movie showed the history of it. Wait, I think it's going to flip. No, it's not, I've got a ways yet. Anyway, it showed the history of Eric's background, which I'd never seen before, and I think there was one brief scene in the movie where King Triton was eating French soup or spaghetti or something. [laugh] That was odd! Now I know there was something else to this, but I can't remember what it was. Oh, I know, during all the nit-picking and stuff, I was on the phone with Jane, and she had a lower voice, and she had matured a little more, and she talked about things that were more diversified and she was a little more pleasant to talk to. And I guess that's that. I guess it came from the fact that Mom and Dad are going to take this defensive driving course to kind of lower their insurance rates, and it's four hours each day on two days, and it was on a Monday and a Tuesday, are the two days that they're going. And, you know, I get a ____ for them Tuesday and Thursday, so, of course, I wish they'd go on a Monday and Wednesday, but it's not given on Wednesdays. Oh well."
"C-041"	"#C-041 (2003-09-29 (18)) I was going to just go ahead and type it out because it's really too complicated to be describing on this tape. But maybe not; maybe I'll do alright. I dreamt that I was having this vision that when Dad was a little boy he was afraid of the same sounds that I am, and that they affected him the same way. And I was having a vision that if a nice person were there to help him through it, it would have been a lot better for him. And the chords of C, E and G, the interval that would get me, is from G to E descending, or any chord for that matter from the top to the middle, top to the middle, top to the middle like, ""Ding [higher] , ding [lower] , ding [higher] , ding [lower] ."" And I guess in this dream I had a vision of somebody doing that on a keyboard and Jimmy's three years old crying, and that was weird. And then I kind of jumped over to another vision, that Mom had these candles. And they were candles, okay? Candles do not make sounds. [laugh] There were these candles and they had different sounds, but there were three of them and they were called C-E-G candles because when you would light them, they would produce the chord of C, E and G over the sound system, along with a bunch of other crazy sounds. And [laugh] this is bizarre. And Mom wanted to try them out with the sound system like at top volume. And it wasn't going to be a scary thing; it was just going to be a thing. And when she lit the candles, it was like -- you know how 1930s and 40's jazz was like, [musical sounds] -- well, it was kind of like that, it was like the funny jazz that we can't stand. And I guess that was the extent of it and then I woke up. I think the candles came in because Mom got some candles from Clark and Marilou. And they were just smelly candles; I can't imagine where I would get the thought that they would make sounds. Anyway, that's that."
"C-042"	"#C-042 (2003-10-02 (18)) We were -- Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town again, and we were watching a video for my 18th birthday party, which I sort of remember attending simultaneously. It was like we started watching the video and suddenly I was there, that kind of thing. I remember it was just like my graduation party except it was like a year after, only this is not really what my 18th birthday was like; this is how I dreamt it was like. We were at the Hilton and I focused in on this crystal chandelier that was like, ""Whoo hoo, _________,"" because I had seen some crystal chandeliers in the ____ing catalog at the ramp (?) place. And somebody was sneaking in to do something, it was Sandra I think. Well, then I was like there at the party, and, you know, dancing and partying and stuff. And of all things, Sandra had Digital Performer on her laptop and she was like -- what should I say? -- recording and mixing the sound right there, kind of like what Dr. Moran was doing with Cake Walk in class -- no wonder! [laugh] I can't remember anything about what she was doing, but then the next thing I knew, we were in my studio and she wanted to transfer the tracks to my desktop so that I could work with them, and I did a lot of hokus pokus last ____ and stuff and she said that my task ____ board can do a lot more than what I usually use it for. And what it is, in reality, is that it takes a_____ audio, turns it into digital, sends it down a USB and __________ because digital audio from a USB converts it to, it's like an external sound card almost. That's why I don't need an internal one. And it also had faders and a couple other controls on it that you can move tactilely and it'll send mini messages to the real faders to move. And Da_____ ______ thought that that feature would be great for me because I'm more tactile than visual, but I found that it was a lot easier just to go to the mixer page and look at one channel at a time and move the faders there because the task scan doesn't have the automatically _______ faders which is clicked in the position when you open up the program like some do. It doesn't move automatically as you move the faders on the screen; it has to synchronize them. And that is a real pain, trust me. And but so Sandra was doing all these things ________, but like ______ teachers that don't help teach me and __________ haven't discovered it. She was doing it right from there, in my dream, of course. And I said, ""Wow, I should be able to do that too."" [laugh] And let's see, then here comes the most bizarre part. I was in this supermarket with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and we were like tasting candy. There was this one mix of candy called Amazing Grace that had like white chocolate balls and different stuff, but I had this plastic sign banana thing with a picture of a wave form on it, and it was represented as of the audio from the Wave Form editor. And I was [laugh] down in this big center area, court like type thing in the supermarket with all kinds of people walking around. I was sitting there moving my finger along this sign banner, trying to highlight and edit the wave form. Now talk about bizarre. And I think shortly thereafter I woke up. You know, sometimes when I sit there doing all that editing, I say to myself, ""I'm going to be seeing wave forms in my dreams."""
"C-043"	"#C-043 (2003-10-07 (18)) I was at Westport College, going to my classes, going about my business. But in my dream my classes were kind of boring, and I had the notion that Mom was telling me that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hospital for some reason. And I can't remember, but she told me that she had really changed. And I had a vision of kind of in this dream, I kind of had a vision of the scene that Mom was telling me about. It was like a vision within a dream, of Mrs. Dougherty standing out in the hallway in front of the little theater at Westport High School kind of crying and feeling really dejected, and saying through her tears how she was just totally so disappointed with all her students and totally jaded by all of them. And she decided that teaching high school music just wasn't for her, and she was going to have to find some other profession, but it was in a really boring field she didn't really like. And I don't know why, whether it was for a nervous breakdown or for something unrelated or what, but she was in the hospital. And I dream that Mom was going to pick me up from Westport College at lunch time and take me there. And I had this thank you card that I wanted to give her from graduation, which I really do; it's sitting on my desk. But in my dream I was going to give it to her when Mom brought me over there. And I started out at Westport College in the morning, and instead of being in my class, my first class was in this bedroom and the guy was like 18 and he was a black guy and he was an instructor. I had a feeling it was Lorenzo from the electronics class. And it was me and him and four other boys that were going to be in his class that was taught in his bedroom. [laugh] And he and the guys left, and I just kind of sat there bored for like half an hour, drawing and writing, and he came back and I said, ""Okay, I'm ready."" And he just said this silly little poem to us and then it was time for us to go to lunch. And I stood out where I usually wait for the cab, but in my dream I was waiting for Mom. And then I woke up. I think this came from the fact that Mrs. Dougherty called Mom and wants her to help hem dresses, and I want to give her that thank you card, and I'm kind of worried about how she's doing this year. I know her kids seemed better last year, and I hope they're better this year. Anyway, that's that."
"C-044"	"#C-044 (2003-10-08 (18)) Consisted of a lot of different components and scenes last night, so I'll try to remember what I can. There's no guarantee it'll be in any kind of order, but oh well. First of all I dreamt that we rented the Coliseum. I'm not sure if we rented the Coliseum or if we were just going to a dance that was held there. But we had the Coliseum, we were there, and it was going to be this Valentine's Dance with this band, Tommy and the Fiends (?), I think, or something similar. And some of the fireman people and different friends of ours were going to be there. And I dreamt that, for whatever reason, we were riding our bikes over, so we wore our sloppy clothes over and we were going to change into our dresses when we got there. And I was going to wear my nice red dress and some nice jewelry, and my Mom was going to wear her Franny dress. And you know what? I had the notion that this was a Valentine's and a Halloween Dance -- is that bizarre or what? Well, so anyway, we got over there and Mom forgot the dresses, so she had to go all the way back home and I was sitting in the Coliseum lobby and Dad should meet me there. And I think I was there before him. And I had the notion that all of our friends were there too, but I didn't know who they were. And somebody up at the desk suggested that they all watch Braveheart while they were waiting, and it was like a pay per view movie, and anybody who wanted to watch the movie had to pay. But they said, ""If you want to watch the movie, show me by looking at the TV. If you don't want to watch the movie, look over at that thing on the wall over there."" And, of course, I was just looking down the whole time, so I think it was obvious that I didn't want to watch the movie, but I wasn't sure. And so then all of a sudden I think I was in school and I was waiting for them to bring the costumes in school. And I was in Dr. Moran's lab and I had the notion that I had written a report in there and I had to print something, like Mom brought the first three pages of my report but she forgot the fourth one, so I had to go in and I had to print my fourth one. And that was successful. And also, then after I printed my fourth report page, I went to Cake Walk, even though it looked totally different than what I'm used to it looking like in real life, and I dreamt that I had, I was mixing like a scene from the Little Mermaid, and I had too many tracks and an audio track, and I don't remember what was in them except it was the Ursula scene. And I had to mix down the two _____ tracks into audio track, then I had to mix the two audio tracks down into one, so I had to do a lot of complicated maneuvers in order to do this, and in my dream I had a nice big cursor that I could follow fast, and I didn't have this ""when you flow"" factor like I do in school. And then as I was doing all this, a girl came on next to me and said something like, ""Hey, what are you doing?"" And she kind of distracted me, and I think -- I can't remember -- but then the scene like suddenly changed and I was back at the Coliseum, but I was outside like on a beach, and I dreamt that now Dad wanted us to wait for him on this beach, and he was coming with Mom with the dresses after a while. And they were having a little party on this beach, and I was sitting under a little umbrella so that I wouldn't get burned by the sun, and I was sitting on this like lawn chair that was like a couch almost. So I put my feet up and was laying back, and there were other people milling around getting like food and c_____s and stuff, and I had this small radio, about the size of my tape machine, maybe a little bigger, and it had an antenna that was kind of standing up, and it was on, but it was kind of quiet, and I was concerned about when people go by, was it going to be really odd or what? [laugh] You know, like ________. And I was laying there, like, ""Dee dee, la dee dah,"" taking it all in, and then I woke up. I never did get to the Coliseum dance."
"C-045"	"#C-045 (2003-10-12 (18)) I had like a really stupid dream a few days ago, and I thought it was too silly and too weird to put on this tape. I just wanted to forget about it. But today, I'm doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there's got to be something to it, so I guess I'm going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was Mom, Dad and I think Aunt Christine and Burt were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was Mom and me and some guy -- I don't know who -- and Mom had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. Mom wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw Mom do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don't remember too much more. There had to be more though."
"C-046"	"#C-046 (2003-10-13 (18)) It wasn't all that odd, but I wish I would quit having dreams about programs I used to mix sound. I mean, it's getting a little crazy now. [laugh] I'm not really sure which of these scenes came first, but I think this is the first one. I was -- how come I can't talk this morning? Okay, I think I'm ready. I was at this -- no, wait -- first I was at the house and my Mac machine was on the front porch. In place of the white bench there was a little table where I was sitting and working. And I was working on some part of DP all visually because the rest of my system was all upstairs, but for some reason that was there, I guess because in my dream Dad figured we could both work side by side, because he would be in the foyer and I would be out there. But the rest of my system wasn't there with it, and I was thinking, ""How in the world am I going to be able to get this back to my studio where my audio system is. Even my task scan was still up here. And just about that point I was deleting a few sound bites, and I was working on something in DP, and Margaret and Ken's mother and their family were inside. I don't know how they got there; they didn't walk past me from the front door. And I think Melinda was there too. And it was like a post-graduation. We didn't get to come to the party, so let's have the party at your house kind of party, even though in real life they did come to graduation. And so I got up from my work for a minute and head into the kitchen to go say hi and then come back and shut down. But before I knew it, I was dancing with them, I was partying with them, I was opening presents with them. And it was dark by the time the party was like in full swing, and I realized I didn't get to shut down. And Dad said, ""Don't worry, I shut down for you already."" And that was that. And then out of the group of people that was there, there was this one black girl, and her name was Arkisha, and Dad was talking on the phone to a Geico agent named Arkisha before. But this girl Arkisha was about my age and she wanted to go to Westport College with me, and she said that she had these friends that were in this Spanish band that were doing some kind of recording test in Dr. Moran's lab, and it was like they're weren't testing out the equipment. The test was on them to see how well they knew how to use the equipment. And Arkisha thought that I knew a lot and wanted me and this other boy to come and help them because they needed assistance. And so in my dream Westport College was like just a walk away, like up on 7th Street, and it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk over there. So we walked over there and I was barefoot, and I had like real sloppy clothes on, and we were walking around the school. And in my dream it was neat to feel the surfaces of the floor and stuff with my bare feet. And we went into Dr. Moran's lab, and it was bigger and it had a blue floor. And there was this little area off to the side where people let bands go when they have to record, which there really isn't. It was like an enclosed glass area with a stage and a sound board. And we were in there and Dr. Moran said that I couldn't help those boys because I knew too much and that I wasn't going to be just a hand, I was going to be wanting to tell them lots of information for their test. And so I was going to go home, and so I was walking out and walking home and again, it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk home because I only had to go like two blocks. And then before I got home, I kind of started waking up, and then I realized where it really was and that it really was too far to walk. And then I kind of faded into consciousness."
"C-047"	"#C-047 (2003-10-14 (18)) At this point all I can remember of my dream last night is that we were all sitting around in the living room naked, like we do talking (?). And there were these people outside kind of milling around. A little later on when we put our clothes on, they ding-donged the doorbell. They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don't know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, ""I made __________ over there."" And then they got a little more serious and said like, ""Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on,"" or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and Dad wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, ""There's got to be a better way to defend myself."" And, I don't know, he said something crazy like, ""You'll scream and you'll get maimed and killed."" And I think that I woke up."
"C-048"	"#C-048 (2003-10-15 (18)) I had kind of an interesting dream last night because it was like very vivid. I dreamt that we were going camping with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly on a Sunday up to, I think it was something like Goldhead State Park, or something like that. And Astrid, when the dream took place, it was like a Wednesday, it was like a few days before camping, Astrid was over and, well, I think even before Astrid got there, Dad was being a little crabby like he gets some times, and Astrid shows up and then Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly show up. And I'm thinking, ""Oh good, we might be able to go a little early,"" and, of course, a lot of people to be with, so things will be under control. And I think Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly came into my bedroom and I was like half naked, and I got a top and I put on a top, and I had to go pee and do a bunch of other things. And little did I know, but Astrid was sitting around bored most of that time. And I came into the living room and she was telling Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, ""Twice now this has happened. She asked me over and got totally distracted,"" something like that. And I came and sat down next to her. She was still talking as I was walking up because she didn't now I was coming. And then I sat down and I took her hand and I talked to her to let her know I was there. And she moved her hand against my shoulder, which she's never done before in real life, and I was like, ""I'm sorry, I just had a lot of cleaning to do and stuff."" And then when she was, a little while later, she leaned up and kind of kissed me on the cheek. [laugh] And then, here comes the really bizarre part. I dreamt that this camping trip -- well, not just for this camping trip -- it had been done before, to have my whole system and everything piled into the back of the car, have the back seat taken out replaced with my desk and all my equipment. And I think I was counting on this setup for this trip because it was going to be quite a drive and I had some work to do for, I think for Dr. Moran, but I'm not sure who. And I can't remember what in the world I was working on, but it was some kind of sequence. I kind of was thinking at that point that I would have access to the thing at school before I left [laugh] , and I could do some of it there. And then suddenly in the course of all this, the scene shifted and I was at Dr. Moran's lab, except it was a huge room, and there were 40 or 50 work stations, kind of like in the commons on the second floor of the Business Tech Building that people were telling me about. Well, this place was like that except the work stations were like I'm used to working at. And somebody, like two or three work stations down from me, wanted to put a picture of Santa Claus on their desktop, and actually it was a picture of her uncle dressed as Santa Claus. [laugh] And I heard somebody warning the person, like the Santa Claus picture that she had might have a virus in it, but nobody seemed to really concede. And then next thing I knew, everybody had Santa Clauses on their desktops because, I guess in that situation, it would be like a network and I guess what would happen to one would happen to all of them. But I had a Santa Claus on my desktop, but I wanted to get rid of it because I wanted the picture that I had before which I can't remember what it was. I didn't have a picture in real life, but in my dream I was used to having a picture of me in my home studio, I think. And so I wanted that picture back. And in the a process of trying to get rid of this Santa Claus and get my picture back, something happened, and I can't remember if it was serious or not. But it was kind of in a fog and I faded into yet another scene, that I was at home and I was listening to like the American Idol on 94.9, and it had somebody doing their version of Celine's ""On the Line"" and it sounded darned close, but it wasn't. And then they were doing like other people's versions of other songs. I can't remember exactly what they were. And then I woke up."
"C-049"	"#C-049 (2003-10-16 (18)) Man, I seem to be having really neat dreams every day these days. I don't know what's up, but I dreamt that I was with this performing group. I don't know if it was a chorus of singers or a dance group, or just a group of friends, but it was some kind of group. And I had a notion that we were either going to perform or have some kind of fun that looked like performing. But we were at this big hall, like the Bayfront Center, and there was an ice rink, and I wanted to get on the ice rink so that I could dance and ice skate with the others. But there were these, all these things around the perimeter, like cover things or grate things that I was afraid of and I was afraid of stepping on. And I was bare foot and I was trying to navigate between them, and more of them kept popping up, and so I had to just back out and not go near the ice rink. And I know there were more scenes, but this is what I get for waiting this late in the day. I don't remember any more."
"C-050"	"#C-050 (2003-10-18 (18)) Well, I guess you could say I had three dreams last night because it spanned three different areas. After all, they say we have a minimum of three dreams a night and a maximum of nine, so I guess I remember all three last night. First of all, this is kind of, we were watching -- oh, wait a minute -- I think there were even some more. I remember a fourth part to this. My goodness! Seeming you remember little parts, your imagination cues and you remember the rest. Dad and Mom and me and even some other people were on this boat, and I can't remember for sure, but we were going to dock somewhere for the night, and we were going to keep going and then we were going to come back and dock in a different place for the night. And I think what it was, is we were trying to figure out where to dock. There was this docking place that was kind of old-fashioned that was built with like a porch swing and some interesting things, and a little lodge thing. And I don't remember why we chose that place, but kind of for the reason that we chose bed and breakfasts over just hotels. And let's see, I really don't remember the details, but it was something about this place where we were going to dock, kind of it was an open, it was a real live environment, like we were under water, but it wasn't; it was on top. It was like this hotel place. And so then the next scene was, is we were in this hotel place kind of sitting around, but it kind of turned into our living room, and we were watching -- or at least I was watching -- Celine's Las Vegas show on TV, and how some of the things were just so complicated. And then at the end of the show it had a feature that showed her dying of a virus that she contracted from Reyna, and that was like the worst thing. And then I think the next part of the dream was that I was in Dr. Schumann's class for Psychology and he was showing us different pictures in the book, like a baby, or a horse, or other things and asking us, ""What do you think people would think when they see this symbol?"" And the class was like totally out of it, but I was real involved and real excited about what he was talking about and everything. Then the next part was that I was in the bathroom of the Social Arts Building at Westport College that kind of put me in mind of the Bell Building at Westport High School. And there was this boy in there that, well, I just sort of knew that the alarm box in the bathroom wasn't working and this boy knew that a fuse had to be replaced, and he had the correct kind of fuse with him. And the boy wanted me to be in there with him when he was doing this because he said that I knew something about electronics that he was unsure of. He had this kind of real mamby pamby lack of self-confidence. So how it ended up was that I was sitting in the bathroom stall on the toilet, not really having to go, just sitting in there. And I heard him clinking and screwing and messing around, but I didn't see what he was doing, of course. And I was just sitting on this toilet totally terrified in fright of what was going to happen if the system sounded. And I was kind of like cowering down and something like that, and the boy assured me that when the alarm system is tested, it's only going to sound at like a quarter of the strength that it would if it was really a real incident. So believing him, I was a little at ease, but I was still real frightened of the whole thing. And [sigh] , let's see, oh, when he finished and he put the thing all back together, he tested it and it was only a quarter of the intensity. In fact, I could barely hear it, and he was like, ""How do I get this thing to come on full?"" meaning the alarm system. And I was like, ""I don't know, but you could ask the maintenance people."" And he was a nice boy. He wasn't one of these teenage sadists, so he gave me time. He said he was going to give me time to get outside and get far away from the building and all like that, and when I went out the back of the Social Arts Building, it was like the track on the PE field of Westport High School, and I sat down near these people that I thought I knew. I started talking to them and they said how, for degree-seeking students, how your first semester was like four general ed classes, boom, boom, boom. And that's what they took, and they said how bored they were. And I was glad I wasn't in their position. And I think that the last part of this dream was that I was back in Dr. Schumann's class, and he wasn't showing us symbols like a baby or a horse. He was showing us more serious symbols like what does it mean to speak to people, how do you think people feel when they have their eyes covered? What happens when they hear certain things? And just real in-depth things like that. And again, the class was like, ""Uh, uh, uh, uhhh...."" And I was raising my hand and wanting to talk about some of these things, and he was like looking around for the rest of the ""Uhhhhh, uhhhhh"" people and trying to enlist them into paying attention and stuff. And then I woke up. [laugh] I have a voice analysis to give about the second part of this dream, the part about being in the bathroom with that boy while he was fixing the alarm box in the bathroom. I think that, first of all in this case, the bathroom does not represent a cleansing environment. It might, but most likely it represents a live environment which would be the worst place that a person would want to be when an alarm system sounds. But what it could be is it could be a cleansing place that appears to have some kind of frightening thing to overcome in order to cleanse yourself. And, of course, the alarm system is the major element of fear in this part, and represents something majorly frightening. The boy, I tend to think, represents a higher power, because the boy really is sympathetic to my being afraid of the alarm system, but he wants me to participate in the operation that he is doing, even though he knows that I'm majorly afraid of it, because he thinks that I can contribute to it in some positive way. And he assures me that it won't be as bad as I'm making it out to be. And also he isn't, he gave me plenty of time to escape when he did want the system to sound at full capacity. So I think there's something going on here, something that needs to occur in my life that may seem frightening, but is worthwhile and I just to have to go through it. [laugh] I don't know. This is deep, man. [laugh]"
"C-051"	"#C-051 (2003-10-20 (18)) I was like a b___ enrollment student doing Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at Westport High School, and only being excused for the time I had to go to the college. And I had a test that I had to take in Psychology at the college, but the test was given to the office of Westport High School for some reason and I had to go by Ms. Teddy's office and get it. And I had to do a couple other things that I can't remember, but I want to know why I keep dreaming about being back in Mr. Jameson's class. It was boring, so I really don't want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am. And I dreamt that I was in Mr. Jameson's class and we were lifting weights and listening to his boombox, and I had to get out of class and go take my test, but I was kind of chicken and didn't know how to ask him and he wasn't even around. And so I had the notion that I'd better just leave and go take my test. And then I woke up."
"C-052"	"#C-052 (2003-10-21 (18)) I had kind of a funky dream about Astrid. I dreamt that it was kind of daylight, but I was still half asleep, and there was somebody in my bed and I thought it was Mom, so I rolled over and put my arm around her like when I do when Mom's in my bed. Well, after a while, she turned over and started talking to me, and I realized it was Astrid and she was kind of holding me too, just like Mom does. But for some reason she was calling herself Krystal. And we were talking about various things, like I don't think she told her Greek mythology story again, but she was thinking how, she was just chatting like people do. And, let's see, I think we got up and we were rearranging my closet, putting some clothes in order and stuff, and I was showing her my porcelain dolls and she was like changing. In life we just dress in front of each other because, first of all, she can't really see so it's not a big deal to her. And, of course, I'm a natural body person so it's not important to me. And so it just works out both ways and we just dress right in front of each other. So that's what we did in my dream. And I had this glow worm that I was showing her [laugh] and the glow worm had like a head band with a butterfly, and she was going to take the butterfly off the head band. Here's where it gets bizarre [laugh] . So anyway, she wanted to take the butterfly off the head band of the glow worm and put it on a ribbon to tie around her waist -- I don't remember how and it was kind of a little scary -- but I was, for some reason she like did something really weird and I had to explain to her about a woman's body and why her private area was important to be clean and covered and all. And she seemed to understand, she seemed to be taking it like a sisterly thing. And then I woke up. And it's funny because oftentimes when I first wake up I can't remember my dream at all. And I just have to think for a while. And sometimes they come to me in the middle of the day. Most people it's just the opposite, and that's how this one worked."
"C-053"	"#C-053 (2003-10-22 (18)) We were going up to ________  again, or somewhere up there, I wasn't exactly sure where it is, and we were going to stay at this rental like party house with, instead of Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, we were going to stay with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Aunt Christine and Burt and Josie and Bobby. And there were about two or three bedrooms on the bottom floor, like two bedrooms on the top floor, and one bedroom at the very tippy top of the third floor. And mine was up on the third floor. Mine was the top one because I had like a lot of sound equipment that I was bringing in for their party, and, come to think of it, it wouldn't make sense to put me and my equipment on the third floor. It would make sense to put us on the ground floor! But in my dream I was on the third floor and this place had an elevator, so I guess I could get it down alright. And to get there I think Mom and Dad preceded me because I had one more day of classes or something. And so I was on this bus, and I had two Peavey Escort systems for some crazy reason, I had a bunch of other stuff, but I wasn't sure exactly what. And I never actually had it in my hands. I had a few people helping me get it on the bus and into this cargo bay, and then when I got there, I don't remember getting there; I just remember suddenly being there. And I don't remember too much about the party we were having, but I do remember staying there, and I sort of remember something about us being together for like a little party or something, and it was outside on the deck. I had the Peavey system out there with the wireless mic. And then we kind of all went to sleep. I had the notion that the party was on the last night that we were going to be there, so after the party I didn't take the Peavey system down and bring it back to my room or anything, I just left it set up. And we all kind of went to sleep. And I remember that night I didn't go up to my room on the third floor with some other equipment piled into my room. That night I just went to _____ and I crashed in Samantha, Sandra and Derek's room with them. And the next morning -- you know how Dad likes to leave out of the house like 4:00 o'clock in the morning if we've got to drive across the state so we can get home at like a reasonable hour? Well, that's what we did, and, of course, I don't have any brains at that hour and then I think we were in the car and halfway through coming home, I realized I forgot both of the Peavey systems and all my other equipment. I left it there. And it was really a bad thing because Halloween was right around the corner. And we called Uncle Burt on the cell phone and he said, ""No problem, we'll swing by that way on the next step on our trip. We'll bring it and drop it off for you."" And we said, ""Okay, that would be great."" And, let's see, oh, when we got home, Uncle Burt had sent a new bag of Halloween things for me, like some plastic rats and some spiders and two statues -- no, three or four statues of cats coming out of pumpkins and ghosts and various things and like lab (?) statues that were like about as tall as my figures now. And there was a statue of Sir Mix-a-Lot, and at the base of the figure it said, ""Baby Got Back."" [laugh] And, of course, Mom was complaining. Oh, and there was one other thing he gave me. It was like a head, a pilgrim head on a stick with a stand. And Mom was really upset because she didn't want to store all this new Halloween stuff. And she was like totally spoiling it for me. And all this stuff was meant to be a thank you for DJ'ing their party or something like that. And then I began to fade into consciousness and I was still kind of out there, but I realized that my Peavey system is on the porch. I just handled it last night, but I was wondering if I had left the wireless mic and other stuff over there. And then when I really came to, I realized that I only have one and it's all in my c__________ and that was just a dream. [laugh]"
"C-054"	"#C-054 (2003-10-24 (18)) I was, I got like a, it was not like a mini disc machine, but it was sort of like that, and it came with five or six packs of like little mini CD R's and it was like a mini disc, except the medium was CD's instead of they're like mini CD's. And I don't remember actually, but I remember thinking how good it was that I had five or six packages of these things. And I don't remember too much except I think Dad wanted me to wrap it up and take it down to like the beach or something so that we could have a party out there and I could like open it for my birthday or something. And then suddenly the scene shifted, and I was in the downstairs bedroom listening to a couple CD's, and I dreamt there was a CD changer in there, which there really isn't, and it was like 6:00 o'clock in the morning when I was doing this. And Mom comes in and all of a sudden I was trying to turn it down because I'm a little embarrassed that I'm like just here. And she said, ""It's alright, it's alright,"" and something like that. She told me something else that she's going to do. She's like going to do something in the kitchen or something. So she goes in the kitchen and all of a sudden the kitchen radio in there, I had the notion that it's a CD changer also, and all of a sudden the CD that I was listening to jumps over there to her and she has to listen to it, and it was kind of a dumb one. And I can't remember anything more. I think I woke up after that. There was something else I remember about this dream now. For some reason, after Mom and I had talked, I was laying there on the bed thinking up a story."
"C-055"	"#C-055 (2003-10-27 (18)) I remember a bunch of scenes, but I can't really tell you which ones came first. But I'll do my best at putting them in order. This is going to be another one that uses up a lot of tape, I think. First, I think, I was having lunch with Ms. Garland at this little strip of shops and restaurants that I had the notion was part of the Westport College campus or just off of it or something. We were eating there and there were some interesting places there, and I was watching the time close because I had to get up to class. And so I went over to the Fine Arts Building, which looked more like the Media Center from Westport High School, and I went into class. Then next day I was there with Mom and it was like evening time, and I think I had asked her to take me to a bar or take me dancing or something, since I'm 18 now. And so we were going to this little restaurant place that we thought was going to be cool, and they had this table and chairs outside with their sound system set up and this band that was playing some good stuff. And we were dancing and dancing for a while, I think, and then she's like, ""I've got to take you somewhere else for a minute, but we'll come back here, I promise."" And she took me into this store, or some kind of place, next door in the shopping plaza thing. And it had an ivory-colored, off-white colored floor. It was almost yellow because of the lights. It was like Circuit City or something. And she was going to like boost me up on her shoulder. She used to be able to do that, but now Dad's only strong enough to. But anyway, in my dream she could still boost me up on her shoulder. She's like, ""One, two, three,"" and I was like perched on her shoulder and she was showing me this shelf way up high that had like six keyboards laid out on it. And I was like, ""Wow!"" And so then she got me down and we went back dancing at that place for a while [laugh] and I'm trying to think here. And I think we danced or something, or we ordered some food or something, but then the scene just sort of like changed, and I was in the Fine Arts Building, which like I said, which kind of looked like the Media Center at Westport High School. And I was trying to find my class, I was trying to find Dr. Moran's lab in there, and I was walking around this hall and I came across this room that I went in. It was really dark and there were three or four girls kneeling in there rehearsing this song in harmony, and I didn't know then that I didn't know the song, and I had this like furry purse with me that was black and I sort of in my head called it a mink purse. And so I didn't really know them and so I just left, and I was coming down the stairs, and the stairs were real, real narrow. There was no railing on one side, and there was a sort of a ""meh"" railing on the other side, and I was going down the stairs and I managed to get down alright, sort of. It was really steep and really narrow, like I dream about stairwells being sometimes. It wasn't dark and scary like they are sometimes, it was just hard for me to navigate, especially with the purse that turned into my book bag in the other hand. And I got down and Mom -- I can't remember if it was Mom, I think it was Mom -- picked me up in the truck, and we were going to the park. And when we got to one intersection there were like, I couldn't see them but she told me they were there -- there were like two fire trucks, a rescue truck, and a ladder truck, I think -- four trucks all together. And I kind of felt like maybe Dad was in one of them and they were going to a call. And they were all running their lights and sirens. How it would work was they would only run their lights and sirens when they were moving, so when they stopped at a red light, they wouldn't run them. And so it seemed that they would always be an intersection ahead of us, and when we would catch up to them and stop at their intersection, we would all go at the same time. And then when their lights and sirens would race past us and I would hear them real loud for minutes and then they'd be like past us. And then they would wait at the next intersection until we got there, and they wouldn't go until we got there. And then they ran their lights and sirens real loud in our faces again. And they did that like three times and I was like terrified when we got to the park. But fortunately, when we got to the park, they turned down another street and were gone. And then I woke up. [laugh]"
"C-056"	"#C-056 (2003-11-02 (18)) I had to go to school at Westport College and I had to ride a bus, and for some reason my classes didn't start until 9:00 o'clock so the bus could wait until 8:25 to come and it would be okay. Well, let's see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there's a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martenson is out, his name is Austin Reilly. In my dream Austin Reilly didn't think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can't remember what we were talking about, but Dad and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn't get to write the paper. And then -- this is the crazy part [laugh] -- there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn't. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn't have that kind of time. And I can't remember why I put it [laugh] . We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany's pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and Dad was walking out the door, he said something like, ""But I'm not sure, but you guys just hate it!"" And then I woke up."
"C-057"	"#C-057 (2003-11-03 (18)) We were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby's all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby's, then it got to the point they didn't really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby's. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had -- what should I say -- this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry-go-around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a -- they didn't really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I can't remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite [laugh] or something stupid like that. And, let's see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage 1 sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I couldn't get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And Mom was like, ""She's asleep, she's asleep,"" on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up."
"C-058"	"#C-058 (2003-11-04 (18)) I was in bed in this strange place, and Mom came up and I was kind of half asleep and half awake, and started picking the scab off my foot with tweezers and it hurt so much and I screamed. And then she was gone. So then I was out to find her. So we were staying in these like three or four level house unit things, like we were exploring across the street from the park on 5th Street and I saw that it was becoming daylight by the time I got out there. And Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce had one and they were sitting out on their front porch. But I couldn't find the one for Mom and Dad and there were a lot of them that didn't look like anything. So then I was just trying to run back and find mine and I couldn't. I couldn't find -- there were like ten of these things in a row and I couldn't find mine. And then I sort of woke up."
"C-059"	"#C-059 (2003-11-04 (18)) We were with Merrilee and she was doing this little home video presentation like type thing and we were going to help her. I don't know if it was Merrilee or Terri, but I think it started out as Merrilee, and we were in her house and we were doing some talking and singing and stuff by video. Then I realized Merrilee turned into Terri and she was taking pictures of us naked, just as normal as anything, in this like bare garage area. And I had to go home and get another set piece, and I ran back and I set up, and they didn't need it after all. They were just going to take pictures of us on the couch. And that's all, I think."
"C-060"	"#C-060 (2003-11-05 (18)) Dad had some kind of city meeting to go to, and Mom wanted to go to an art show, and I guess I was going to go with her. And there was something about, ""Okay, this is the rule: we're going to each do our own thing and we're not going to run into each other."" And so we set off on our bikes, and there was like this booth set up that we were supposed to go see, but we never really.... Oh, I know, she was going to go see her art, and afterwards we were going to do something together. And I was kind of being babysat at a fire station while she was going to look at her art. And they were doing something inside like a show thing and I got to go in and see it. And I was worried about them doing their sirens and this and that, but they said they weren't going to do that for some reason. While I was outside talking to a lady in the back, I heard three sirens, one each had two tones at different intervals, and I told her the intervals that I didn't mind. It was one broader than the usual. I don't know, but it was broader than the one that gives me nerves. So then we went inside and we got to see this show. It was kind of dark and we were all like sitting on the floor. This was this girl, she was playing taps on like a huge bugle thing, and then she had a keyboard that she was playing some jazz on, and apparently she got her right and left hands mixed up because her mother kept saying, ""Wrong arm, wrong arm,"" or something like that. [laugh] And then there was this Indian dance that was like shaking shaker things or something. Then suddenly I was with Mom again, and we were going off to, we were going to find someplace to dance and have fun because it was a Friday night, and I don't know if we ever found a place or not. I seem to remember looking at a menu at this bar place, but it's all I can remember."
"C-061"	"#C-061 (2003-11-08 (18)) Samantha, Sandra, and Lee and Derek and Mickey were in town. I don't know if Lee was there, but I know the others were there. And I had the notion that Sandra was getting married again. I wasn't sure if it was remarrying to Lee, or if it was marrying somebody else, but her and Samantha and everybody were like keeping everything all secret for some reason, I guess they just didn't know, and they were all kind of unprepared. She was just getting herself together. And I didn't really know if I was supposed to be her DJ sound person for her reception or not, and I was going to go over to her and ask her and say, ""Hey, what about your reception?"" because I had to know whether I should pack up the Peavey system or not. And I don't remember what she told me; I think she said, ""I'm still not sure."" So [laugh] that's pretty unsure. And so I packed everything up, just in case, and I think we were in the truck going down there, and Derek was driving, and I was there and there was somebody else, I think it was Mickey in a black dress, and all the other people on a different vehicle. And then I kind of woke up. I didn't think this was important enough to put on here, but then I realized that maybe it is because it kept coming back to me all day today. And I think it came from listening to the graduation footage and all the commotion that was going on in our house that we'd been hearing all their voices again, and thinking about when they were in town and all like that. And I guess that's all I have to say."
"C-062"	"#C-062 (2003-11-12 (18)) I was at our house, but somehow I was in the dining room and our machine was set up in there for some crazy reason. And I was working on XP, a much more opulent desk than what we have, and I think I was, I was either typing something in Word or I was looking at pictures; I can't remember which. But Dad was waiting for me to finish something so we could go for a walk or something, and, you know, in real life it's set up so Dad and I have separate logins so that our display settings can be set. Well, I dreamt that in my dream I was so in a hurry, I shut down and I forgot to logoff. And instead of shutting down, it was doing a restart and acting all crazy. And Dad was leaving out the door without me because I had to stay and attend to it. And I think I woke up. [laugh] That was really stupid. I'm kind of wired for sound tonight, can you tell?"
"C-063"	"#C-063 (2003-11-14 (18)) Let's see how much of it I can actually remember. First I dreamt that me and Samantha and Sandra and Derek and a couple other people were staying in this house, like a bed and breakfast, except the owner wasn't there. It was just the place was all to ourselves. And we were doing a bunch of things, I can't remember what, and it was our last night there and somebody warned me that they were going to have to do a fire drill just because it was in the protocol that they had to do it, but that none of us had to be there when they did it because they just had to test the alarm system. So I was getting dressed and I was getting my clothes on really fast, hoping that I could get out there before they actually did it. So I was getting dressed and I grabbed my bags and I slipped my shoes on and I went outside. And I put my bags by the truck, and I started walking down the alley a little ways so that I could be further away from the building, I guess. And I was just standing, when I thought I was far enough away. Well, Samantha, she comes out and she has this red thing in her hand. I guess I thought it was one of the sound emitters from the building [laugh] , and she had it in her hand, and I start running, and she says, ""Oh, smart girl!"" And she catches up to me and she stuffs this thing in my back pocket, and I rip it out and I throw it and I keep running. And she grabs it and she runs after me, and she comes near me with it again, and I ran some more until I was far enough away and then I stopped. And then I dreamt that I was in class. I didn't know if it was Business Law class or one of my new classes for next semester, but I was in class and they were doing busy book work in class, which is very rare, and I was doing mine and I was looking at something that I wrote. I mean, I was looking, I had this paper and it was, it had a big design on the top of an Indian holding a bow and arrow, and I was looking at something that I had printed on it from my machine upstairs here, like I had a printer. And I printed right over the top of this bow and arrow picture, and it was a big, like half a page, picture. And it was something very personal. It was a journal entry about the thing in the last scene about staying in the picture, running away from Samantha. And then I was like in the kitchen with Mom, and I was standing up on this -- oh, wait -- after the bow and arrow paper thing, some girl kind of got a little faint and leaned on my desk, and the teacher came to the other side of my desk and was trying to support her. And I got like smashed in between them so that I could hardly breathe. I was feeling very faint, and I couldn't duck my head and get out from under them or between them or anything. And I can't remember any more."
"C-064"	"#C-064 (2003-11-15 (18)) It was pretty long, but I think it speaks a lot. I dreamt that Mom and I were going to go on this Halloween party boat and we had tickets and she had bought them for $4.99 somewhere. And we were going to kind of slip out because the party went from like 9:00 until like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, so we were going to slip out after he went to bed, and we were going to go. And she was sleeping in my bed here, which really she wasn't, but in my dream she was. And we were talking about, actually I think we were laying on the floor and we were talking about how we were going to go, we were going to go and keep sneaking up behind us. And then I go downstairs and he sees how, I think he heard a lot of what we were conspiring to do. And he picks me up and he holds me and he feels really sorry that -- what should I say? -- I guess that he'd made the image that he had, and something else like that. And I just come out and tell him that Mom and I had these tickets to this party. [laugh] And the party was supposed to be on a boat, and they were like for, they for cheap, and that we were going to go. So we go, and, of course, I was expecting like a big boat and a band and a show and a party and stuff. But this was like, you know at an airport there's a long hall that connects to the plane? Well, in this situation there was a building that was an art gallery, and there was a long hallway corridor that was leading to this square room, and there was a gray rug, and it was supposed to be the boat. This square room with a gray rug was supposed to be a boat, this big party boat that everybody was talking about. So I knew -- and even though it was supposed to happen at night, it was light outside, and the only seats were the ones that we were in. And I get on first because I'm afraid that we're going to be late, and Mom is there looking at pictures and she says she'll be meeting me. And who comes on and joins me, but Dad instead. He like takes her place. And, let's see, so we start sailing, and it's like, they like do something, seal off the engines like they do on a plane, and we kind of shove off from the building with this square room, sailing through the water. Maybe this is because all I see of the plane area is a square cabin, but anyway, pretty soon, when we're sailing, the floor goes away, the glass in seals it goes away, they put some, that orange construction fence around and a board for the roof and just a seat and that's all. And then it stops and we're like swinging around inside of it, there's like water in it, and really not a party at all. But Dad had me dive to the bottom and show me where there some connection made underwater for the sound system, I think, which I don't know why that would be, if there's no sound and no party. But anyway, let's see, I think we go past a beach and Mom just kind of swims out from the beach and comes and joins us. And then I kind of woke up. That was really a bummer because I was expecting to go on this party, but it wasn't. It was just a dumb little ocean cruise thing. I think this comes from the fact that Lib Fest (?) was last year and she and I went to see Swarner (?) and we had a great time. And this year BTO was playing last night, but it was their TV night. That and Third Watch was on. And tonight is Creedence Clearwater Revival and Astrid's coming, but if she doesn't come for whatever reason, we can go, I think. So that's that."
"C-065"	"#C-065 (2003-11-17 (18)) Let's see, how should I start? Well, first of all, I don't know if I was back at Westport High School or still at Westport College, but I had some classes to go to, and I was oftentimes I would go like to the bathroom in between classes. Well, in this one class that I was in, I met the teacher and she said that I really needed to not be late so much because I was getting behind in material. And, oh, this is so weird -- this class was a PE/ Music class. We were going to be like singing, but she said we had to get stronger by doing things like sit-ups and [laugh] lifting weights and stuff. And so we would do a combination that, and I think there were like no more desks and I was like standing in the back of the room, and she was teaching us about theory, and she was showing how chromatic scales are a lot easier to play, but major scales sound better and more complete. And I'm trying to think, I don't remember the examples she gave. This room was like kind of small, but there were like, I don't know, two or three rows with people in front of where I was standing, if that means anything. And this teacher was like a nice woman, she was wearing jeans, I think. And I don't think Mrs. Dougherty ever wore jeans, and I don't think Mrs. Hagerman did either, but she seemed like jeans was like something about her personality that she was more like Mrs. Hagerman, more casual and what have you. But suddenly the scene like shifted, and I was at home and I was fixing some kind of lunch for myself, and I hear this funny sound in the living room and I can't figure out what it is. And Mom said that she had borrowed and brought home a Yamaha Clavinova, not from Dr. Moran's lab, but from this teacher. And she said that the teacher had told her that I was kind of like, kind of bashful about touching it, and she wanted my Mom to work with me with it. And [laugh] let's see, the thing of it was, when you would walk towards it, it would make this funny buzzing sound, like when you first, I don't know, a feedback loop in the lower frequency range, I guess you could say. But it didn't do that at home, I don't know why, so I saw it in the living room and Mom was trying to convince me to sit down in front of it, and it started shrinking and shrinking and shrinking, and before I knew it, it was the size of something for a Barbie doll. And then I woke up. Well, wait a minute, one other crazy twist I remember about this dream: when it was shrinking and shrinking, Mom like took a piece off of it, and I realized that it was chocolate with like vanilla frosting, and that it really wouldn't make any sound if I were to touch it and try to carry a tune. So she cut off a piece of the chocolate from the edge and I had a bowl of ice cream and she just threw this piece of chocolate in my bowl of ice cream. And I really didn't want to finish my ice cream, but I woke up before I could."
"C-066"	"#C-066 (2003-11-20 (18)) At first I wasn't going to record it, but then I realized if I'm going to be true to myself while I'm doing all this psychoanalysis, I have to record it. I can't just portray myself favorably like human nature says we do, because then I'd be calling the kettle black, trying to figure out everybody else's mishaps. So no matter how embarrassing it might be at times, I'm going to try to tell all that comes into my life. I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, and they were kind of planning something for me for Christmas, and come to think of it, we were planning surprises for each other for Christmas. And we had just come back from some beach thing. I think we were coming back from a long walk on the beach that was nice, and we were all riding in this van - Samantha and Sandra and Derek, Nikki and me. And Mom and Dad were there. I sort of like had the notion that they were there because I heard them talk, but some driver was driving us around, like one of my cab drivers. And we were talking about various things, I can't remember what exactly. But Dad was asking me questions like, apparently in my dream he had heard my CD that I had burned from Music and Computers class, which I really haven't burned it yet, and he was asking me questions like, ""How did you do all this stuff?"" and ""Do you know how to play any songs?"" and this and that and the other. And the van driver stopped and we all got out, and we went into this place that was kind of like the foyer area of the Radisson Hotel that we go to for awards and ceremonies sometimes, except this place was carpeted, and it was big and spacious. But I didn't know exactly where we were, but it was someplace fancy and elegant. I kind of had the notion that it was a furniture store because there were couches and chairs and tables and stuff spaced out all over everywhere. And I think there was a staircase off to the side, and it was kind of brownish carpeting. And Dad had me -- think it was Lee, I don't know if it was Lee of Dad -- but one of them had me sit down at this set of keys, like the model we have in school, and play ""Joy to the World."" And I put my hand at the top of the middle C octave, but as I was descending down the scale, like you do in the first line, I realized that the thing was like up sideways and I like, I don't know how to explain it, but it was like instead of horizontal, it was almost vertical. It was kind of like at an angle almost. And after you got down to G, the C octave just kind of disappeared and you had to take your thumb and go along the side of the unit with these ""dup dup dup dup"" things on the side, these little rounded keys after G. F, E, D, C were on the side; they were little rounded things. And it got more and more horizontal and more and more horizontal, and then I realized it was all white, but amazingly enough I was able to play this song perfectly. And Dad was pretty amazed, and he said, ""You have to have one for Christmas."" And he said that this model that we were sitting near was kind of an old-fashioned type of model, and he was in search of one that was, I don't know, like a few generations up, I guess you could say, you know how units are. But somehow I wasn't really supposed to know [laugh] and Sandra -- we were back in the van and Sandra was like, you know how Sandra is in surprises -- she's very good at keeping them. And then -- what should I say? -- down, a little while later the scene just shifted, and I was in the dining room and I saw the manual for the model that I was going to have, and I was going to take it over to the monitor and read some of it. But I woke up first. And that was that."
"C-067"	"#C-067 (2003-11-22 (18)) I was at home and there was this woman who came over to talk to me, and she was an elderly woman like Margaret Henderson, except she was calling herself Mrs. Michaelson, and she was talking like Mrs. Dougherty, so apparently she was a figure that was all of those rolled into one. [laugh] Bizarre, man. And I was sitting on the stairs and she was kind of like laying on the stairs above me and like leaning on her elbow so she could talk to me, and she was saying how it would sure be nice if I could be coming back to Westport High School and attending a chorus rehearsal so that I could be in the concert. And I was explaining to her that I wish I could, but I have college. And you know how people sometimes lay a guilt trip on you and stuff. Well, she was like trying to do that. Anyhow, she had this sweet old lady kind of a voice, and Mrs. Dougherty doesn't lay a guilt trip on people if they're not actually in the group full time, but this woman did. So she was talking to me about coming to rehearsals and all, and I can't remember, but I think she gave me a teddy bear and some kind of diamondy-like Christmas ornament. And I'm trying to think what else. I let it slip away because I went back to sleep this morning instead of record it. A thing with me is sometimes I wake up with a really dry throat and feel like ""bleah...."", I'm in a groggy sleep state, and if I get out my tape machine and record my dreams, I'll sound like really far away like I do sometimes, and I'll be all dry, and you know how that goes. So I think I wait until I'm a little more awake and I'll sound a little more normal, but then I forget half the dumb thing. And sometimes I'm too lazy to reach over and grab this thing, so I guess I'll just have to do that."
"C-068"	"#C-068 (2003-11-23 (18)) I was coming home from school and my driver said that he wasn't going to have any calls for a while, and it was the middle of the day and he wanted to take me to this theme park and I kind of had to say yes. So went there, and he drove me over this great big bridge to get in there. And it was kind of more like a playground than a theme park. They had all of this furniture and things out of wood and they had little play things out of wood, but there weren't really any rides per se. So we were for a little bit. He sat and he waited for me, and I took like I don't know how long, a little while. And then I decided that I should call Melinda and see if she could come meet us here. And she wasn't there, obviously, like she never is. And so then I was home and we were looking at this catalog at dresses and things and Mom was telling me that she had a dream about the chickens, and that they were eating, like they hadn't eaten in two days because of seed. And I went out there and fed them, and they did that for me. There was a white one and a brown one, and they were eating out of my hand like feverishly. And I think that's all there is."
"C-069"	"#C-069 (2003-11-27 (18)) First thing that I can remember is that I was walking down the street with Astrid, kind of early in the morning, and down at the end of 24th Avenue there's 4th Street, and down there at 4th Street there's a bus compound. I mean, there's not really, but there was in my dream. And I could see the buses leaving from the bus compound, and there was a school bus that was coming to the house for me, and so I had to, Astrid and I just ran back to the house to try and beat them, but we didn't make it."
"C-070"	"#C-070 (2003-11-27 (18)) I had a chicken -- Brenna -- and she was like up here in the white bird cage, and I think she was there because there was something prowling around in the yard. And she'd been there a few days, so I decided that it was kind of time to take her out again. So I took her out and put her in the yard."
"C-071"	"#C-071 (2003-11-27 (18)) Dad and I were at the park reviewing psychology, and we found this bench to sit on, and there was this dog that was laying near the lake, just laying there and seemed just exhausted. We threw him some bread and he ate it, but other than that, he didn't want to move. And then these other two dogs came running down the sidewalk, barking and yelping almost in unison. And they were just going over to that other dog, going to terrorize the heck out of him. And I stood up and yelled at them and ran them off, and they had collars, I think, because I heard them clinking. And Dad got up and went off and ran after them and he came back and he said he caught one of them and he had it in a covered box. And he said he was going to report the owner to the SPCA or something. And then I think I woke up. That doesn't make any sense at all."
"C-072"	"#C-072 (2003-11-29 (18)) First I dreamt that Mom and I were at Westport College and going around to my classes, and it was like a holiday, so they had like stands where they had free food. And I was going around with a box collecting some, and Mom decided she was going to take it home. Let's see, they had everything that they were giving away, even little bags of chicken nuggets, and I kind of, I excused myself because I had to go to class. We went out riding bikes and I was riding the tandem by myself and Mom and Dad were riding their bikes, and I was doing all kinds of silly stuff, like spinning around and around and around and around and kind of, you know, like that. And coming up to the point where the sidewalk changed, this is at Oceanside Beach area, and I realized that they had gotten really far ahead of me, and that I should just catch up. And where the sidewalk changed there was this big round cover, and there were a bunch of little ones in front of it. And it was like I couldn't go around it so I had to ______ down and walk over it, and the bike was so light I could pick it up and carry it. And I went until I caught up with them, and Dad had realized that my chain had fallen off, and he put it back on, and by then there was some lightning and thunder. And we were starting to turn around and head back home. Now I have a more vivid memory, and I remember when we turned around and headed back, the tandem was full-size again and I was on the back of it with Dad and we were riding home. And then the scene kind of like shifted, and I was here in my bed and it was dark, and I was listening to the radio, which in reality it didn't come on yet, but in my dream it was on, and it was this techno-y rap kind of thing. And there was this scary techno song that had a s_____ score that goes, ""Dee dee dee dee dee,"" and then, ""Bee bee bee bee bee bee bee,"" and then, ""Dee dee dee dee dee."" And in my dream it was just really scary because it had that interval in it, and so I reached over and I was changing it to something else, that was, I guess, something smoother and easier. And then I realized that there was this person in my bed, supposedly Mom. I had the feeling that I knew who it was. But the person's skin was like wet, and I was thinking how it would be alright to listen to the techno-y song if Mom was there and I could hold her and all, but it was some person, maybe even a doll with wet skin, and so I had to get away from that scary thing and go to something else. And then I woke up and it was light out."
"C-073"	"#C-073 (2003-12-01 (18)) I had a very lucid dream last night, very lucid and very memorable. That is why it's still with me in the middle of the day, because I was too lazy to go get another tape this morning. So that's that. I don't think I'd do as vivid of a description if I recorded it in the middle of unconsciousness, like when I first wake up. But anyway, last night I dreamt that Mom and I were walking home from someplace and we were talking about getting Dad this vintage collectible fire truck, remote control activated thing, for Christmas, you know, like the things Derek used to have. And we were saying how great it would be because it was nice and painted, and I had the notion that he collected fire memorabilia, but he doesn't -- Quinn does. And so we were talking about getting that for him, but then I realized that when you make it back up, it does this stupid back-up alarm sound and that wouldn't be good. So we decided not to get it for him. But, you know, he got it for himself, and I kind of had the notion in my mind that he had agreed to -- I guess play with it while I wasn't home, kind of like I blast the sound system while he's not home. But anyway, in amongst all that ruckus I dreamt that I was watching a Celine Dion Las Vegas concert on Mom's TV in her room, and I guess I think I remember watching her sing a song of some kind, kind of like a _______, something in Latin, in a black dress. [laugh] And then the pace picked up a little bit, but instead of singing, for all her dancers and cast, she was like suggesting fashions that would look good on them, going around and giving them these clothes to change into. And this one girl got pants that were slightly longer than the shorts of the others, and she asked why and Celine politely put it that her thighs were a little big and she needed something longer to make them look prettier. And I don't think that went over too well with the girl. And then, in the middle of the TV thing, I heard Dad's fire truck thing that he supposedly got for himself in my dream, outside. Speaking of back-up alarms, there's two of them going at the construction site across the street, but they're not the scary kind. I don't know if this will pick them up or not. They stopped now. But anyway, I heard his thing that we supposedly got for him outside in the back yard and I had the notion that he was running it in the dirt, and I couldn't see it, and it was going, ""Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"" and I could hear it from inside, so I was kind of like in a panic. And I went in my closet and I closed the door, and I sat and I covered my ears, but it was still the same level, in fact it was coming a little closer and getting a little louder. And he was even running his belt sander to cover up the sound so I wouldn't hear it, and it was still audible to me. And, you know, in real life that wouldn't be true. [laugh] But soon after I woke up and I realized it was all a dream. [laugh] They've been advertising the Hess (?) truck, you know, that they do every year on pretty much everywhere I've been listening, so maybe my subconscious was remembering the little truck that Brittany had that would make that crazy sound when it would back up. And Brittany was sensitive, though, she wouldn't do it while I was around once she figured out that it scared me. In fact, she was trying and trying to turn the sound off of that thing. And I think I was combining those two. You know, I don't know, I think that it's one of those crazy things that just comes up as a figment of the imagination. I don't think it means anything. One more thing, while I was cuing up a VS tape to record ""American Dreams"" last night, there was a Celine Dion Oprah Winfrey interview preview thing, and she was singing, and I had to put the tape on fast forward, but I wanted to watch the picture, so it was like, ""do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-ahhh."" [laugh] And I guess I was imagining all kinds of crazy things going on as I was watching the elaborate Las Vegas show go by really, really, really, really fast. And I think that's it."
"C-074"	"#C-074 (2003-12-03 (18)) I think I had a dream about walking into outer space last time, but I'm not really for certain. I'm not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we're in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth's gravitational force. And it's like, this doesn't make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you're out of its gravitational force, but I guess it's the orbit that I'm thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free. So that was a messed up dream with nothing to it, I guess."
"C-075"	"#C-075 (2003-12-04 (18)) I had kind of an interesting dream last night, but this is one that I don't really see the sense in yet. I dreamt that I was working on DP or something to that effect. It was some other kind of program that was kind of similar, but instead of just being in my studio here on the west wall, my machine was set up on a little wobbly table inside my closet, and I only had a little bit of elbow room one way or another. And the light from the monitor kept it from being too dark in there. And somehow I had a little bit of some kind of sound system in there. And [laugh] I'm trying to think now, what happened. Oh, I think before any of this I had lent my machine to Terri, I mean the whole shebang, the monitor and everything, because hers is one of those all-in-one things and hers was down and out for whatever reason, and she had this paper thing she had to finish for her job, and so I lent it to her. And she brought it back to me and was setting it up in my closet like I needed it to be. And, let's see, I didn't feel claustrophobic in my closet. I felt okay, and I seemed to be content in that little mess. I was still a little crowded out, but I was okay, other than that. And I can't remember much else. Oh, I know. The scene kind of like shifted all of a sudden, and I was in the church, and instead of listening to just eight or ten magical singers, I was listening to this great big, huge choir singing and accompanied by an organ. And their songs were all right, but they weren't that impressive. Things are never as impressive as they should be in dreams, for some reason. Whenever I would dream of opening presents, usually they're like boring things. And things are just usually not as exciting in dreams as in reality. But maybe that's for the fear that they won't be. And that's all I can really remember. I think the thought of working comfortably in my closet relates to the fact that I think I would be just fine if I were by myself and nobody knew, like what I was doing or how much time I was spending on one thing, and I was just working along at my own pace, twiddley-dee, twiddley-da [laugh] . And I guess lending my machine to Terri is something kind of literal. I wrote the Christmas wish letter for her, and hers is like so old, running always 8.6, bless her heart, she can't even get online. And I've offered that if she needs to run around on a faster platform, she's done enough printing for me, she should come over and run around on a faster platform for a little while. But I guess that's just some crazy thing that entered my mind."
"C-076"	"#C-076 (2003-12-05 (18)) I was first, and most prominently, even though I think it was last, I dreamt that I had to go back to Westport High School for some reason, I didn't know why. But then I went in this office that was kind of dark and it had several layers in it, like it had several steps down in places, like the sound both at Memorial Stadium. And I realized that it was the VE Specialist's office and I had to talk to Ms. Coombs. And I told her that I'm not back here to take any more academic classes. I've already graduated. I'm back here, I think it was to take chorus class or something, which I guess that would be explainable because I'm working closely with Mrs. Dougherty and I'm volunteering at Westport High School and I have one of Westport High School's volunteer ID's. And then Ms. Coombs finally got it and then Mrs. Hollander came up, and I was practicing speaking Spanish to her, and I was telling her that Mom will be there with her painting on Monday, and different stuff like that. And from what I remember about what I was speaking, it was correct grammatically. And, let's see, what else? Oh, before any of that, I was here in my bedroom with this really long tape that was given to me like in the four track format that the Library of Congress records in, and it was this kids' cartoon tape about different historic events that happened. It was about Christopher Columbus and his Spanish friend that came to America, and they were just being real goofy and silly on the tape. And I was trying to get to the part, I guess it was the other side of the tape that was talking about reading music, and Mrs. Dougherty wanted me to listen to it. But there was so much of this Christopher Columbus goofiness that I didn't get to the other part. I can't remember too much more, but I have this vague memory that me and four other people were in this crowded little store like an antique shop, but we were practicing singing in there. We were each dressed up as a different character, which they were last night, and there was an accompanist there kind of leading us. And we sang something and like everybody started crying, and I didn't and I was wondering what was the big sad thing here. I couldn't figure it out. And I think that's all."
"C-077"	"#C-077 (2003-12-11 (18)) I had a dream about sound last night, and now I've just got to remember what it was. We were at this place like Scenic Point or Becker Park, and they were having this kind of little festival thing with cupcakes and different little craft booths and different things going on. And there was this little area only reserved for VIP's and only VIP people could go there. And it had this little orange net fencing surrounding it, you know like they do sometimes at blockade sites. Well, there was a gap in the orange net fencing and Dad was putting bulb (?) and just ___ back there. We didn't know it was only for VIP's and we didn't have a pass, and once we got back there, everybody was very accommodating to us. And we went up on this deck and we saw like some sound equipment, like a couple mike stands and a couple amps and mixers and things laying around. And that was pretty cool, but then the deck was like the deck of like a house or something that had a door on the front, like the front door of a house. But when you went in this front door, it would be like really, really dark with only a little window at the top. And it was a narrow hallway, and it was deep. I mean, I should say it was a deep way down from the deck to the floor, and there was a window up high. The doors had windows in them. And the window light reflected against the wall and it looked gray. And we go down this tunnel. Well, first of all, in my dream I like was in a hurry to get in this door because there was a lot of sophisticated equipment in there, or so I thought. And I think this is an important part of the dream. And I went in the door and let it close behind me, I was so scared and petrified that it was so dark, that I opened the door and I waited a few minutes for Dad to come with me. And he came with me and we, it seemed a little lighter when he was there with me. And boy, I'm using up tape like crazy here. Why I can't stop stuttering and la la la blah. Oh well, anyway, it seemed lighter when he was down there, and there was some kind of a sound system in there that had a couple of subs that went, ""boom, boom, boom"" with some kind of rap beat, you know how it goes in those big cars? Except it wasn't that intense; it was about the level of mine, but it was just kind of isolated and not a whole lot of highs or anything else. And I thought, ""Hey, that's cool,"" and I had a feeling like it was like a testing site. And went down this hall and we came out. It led into like a nice little shop thing, and this shop had everything from like candy canes to little ornament ball things, to baskets of goodies and stuff. And I had a feeling it was like somebody's house, but it was a shop too, and there was a lady there that was real nice and kind and accommodating to us, and gave us something, I don't remember what, from her kitchen table, something like a sample to eat. And then we went out the door and we were back at the Becker Park place, and Dad said, ""Want to do that again?"" and I said, ""Yeah."" So we stepped into the orange fencing, we went up on the little deck, I saw the equipment up on the deck, we went down in the little dark tunnel thing with the subs that were booming and went through the lady's little shop, and, hey, that was fun. It was like a round, round, round circle. We did it a couple times. And then I had Astrid with me and Dad, and I was leading Astrid up onto the deck and down into the little dark tunnel thing, and the tunnel thing seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it. I think that's symbolic. And this time I was leading Astrid through it, and I lead her, she wasn't scared at all, of course. Well, even though she couldn't see, she knew it was kind of dark in there and cramped and tight, and she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And then I led her into the shop thing, except it had transformed this time, and not only was it that lady's shop, it was like somebody's bedroom. And we were like snooping in somebody's bedroom and they had a whole stack of CD's and stuff, and Astrid was wanting me -- and all of these CD's were new, they were wrapped, like the shrink wrap. And Astrid was telling me, ""Tell me what this one is, tell me what this one is,"" and some of the titles I could read and some I couldn't. And just before I woke up, there was this CD that had the cover of like a green spider web, and it had white lettering on it that said ""50 cents,"" you know, like the rapper guy. And then I woke up. Man, that was something. And, you know, it's evening time and it stayed with me the whole day. Isn't that amazing! But I think this is kind of symbolic. In the past I have had a few dreams about a roundy-roundy-round circle that just is continuous, like, for example, I had a dream one time that a cellar went down into a sub-cellar that led out into a, like a netting tube that you would go up and get in the attic. And when you were in the attic, there would be a whole bunch of stuffed animals and it would be kind of hard to breathe in there. And you would have to fight your way through tons and tons and tons of stuff in order to get out of there. It was kind of like Mom's attic is. And then you would be in the house, and that was a circle that involved dark and scary places. Now this circle had a dark and scary place, but it was only one, and it involved sound, which makes me think about life when I analyze this. The fact that the tunnel seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it, I think has to do with experiences that are new and odd and scary. They seem easier each time I have the same experience, and I think the first time that I went in there when I was so scared and petrified and I waiting for Dad, I think some experiences are like that. I am afraid to do them on my own, and even though he's more critical and slower and harder, I want to have somebody help me through them. And I think the lady's shop symbolizes like a house, like almost being in a home-like environment. I don't know, I'm drawing a blank there. But the fact that I had Astrid on this round circle thing with me, I think is that I think I've had enough in the sound industry that I can start leading Astrid through it. And that's all I have to say for now. My throat is dry and I've used up enough tape. Another thing I thought of, I think the fact that we started out that an event at Becker Park or Scenic Point and going in that VIP section and people not minding us just barging in there has to do with the fact that coming into the sound industry in all this stuff, I started not knowing a darned thing and being at events like that, at public places, and wanting to go behind and wanting to just jump over those stupid fence things, and wanting to go talk to the people and they never really minded it. And that, inside the VIP fence is like inside another world. And I think -- I don't know if this circle was about life, or if it was about the other world contained in the sound industry, or whether it's about both. I don't know, but that's that."
"C-078"	"#C-078 (2003-12-14 (18)) Was kind of involved, but I only remember bits and pieces of it now. First I was in a group of singers, a special little group that Mrs. Dougherty had put together, and we were practicing singing, ""What Child Is This,"" but somehow nobody else sang and I ended up singing it like a solo. And she was saying ""Good job"" to everybody, even though nobody else sang. That was funny. And I think we were getting some kind of stage ready for some kind of performance. We were deciding who was going to be where and what we were going to do. And then she took me aside and she asked me, she told me that she knows how to read music on a staff, but she wanted to know how do you read music in the form of mini data in an arrangement window, you know, like with the vertical keys and the lines and the grid and stuff. Well, that's what I was going to teach her how to read. And I was going to write a little book on that at home, but I was having a tough time finding some paper. And there were some other things going on. I think somebody wanted me to hurry up and get out of the house with them to go somewhere, and I didn't have time to make this book. And just before I woke up, I was writing out part of it. I remember something else about this dream now. This was a really important part. I don't know how I could forget. I dreamt that the phone rang or something and called me away from what I was doing, and I had to leave my computer like at the desktop, the Mac. And I ran to the phone and got called away, or something, and when I came back, I found Dad sitting in my chair getting into my folder of word processing, all my journal and stuff, and just reading. For some reason he sized the window down to a little tiny, tiny thing and he was just reading, and he said, ""I see you _____ a word processor here. Why would you be doing that?"" And I'm thinking, ""Ahhhh, this is the death of me!"" And I finally convinced him that he shouldn't be looking at that, that that's a private thing, and somehow I didn't need to give any more of an explanation. Then some older lady was working with me and she took me online to get something, I don't know what, but something audio that was playing through the task scan, and somehow she shut me down without getting me offline, and usually in the world, you just automatically get offline when you shut down, if you don't already. But I was all up in arms that I hadn't been disconnected from the line, and so she had to start up all over again and get me offline and shut down. And I don't know what happened after that."
"C-079"	"#C-079 (2003-12-16 (18)) We were babysitting that girl Brittany from the Barrett's house and she's kind of an immature kind of blah kind of person, and she had this program, you know, like they give out in the theaters, that kind of program, for this ________ concert that I'm supposed to go to for Christmas. And I asked her if she could tell me what the date was that the performance was going to be, and she didn't really know how to count; she kept getting all mixed up. She kept telling me, ""26, 25,"" and I kept telling her, ""I think you mean 12/25."" And she's like, ""Oh no, it says here 26, 25."" Wonder what that can mean? And she was opening it up, and for some reason it had all these stickers in it and her ticket, and I don't know what the stickers were for. They were like hearts and flowers and teddy bears. And I couldn't really read the date; it was too small. And then I went into the kitchen and there was this thing sitting on the counter, and I picked it up and I thought it was a piece of chocolate. And I took a little taste of it, and it was lipstick, and I was like, ""Bleah!"" And I've never really done that, so I don't know where that came from. And then I was coming out to ride the bike with Dad, and I had this dress on that came to my mid thighs, and it was really cold, but I had this dress on. And I don't know why, and I was going to ride the bike in this dress. And that's all I can remember. I think I woke up after that, but I don't know."
"C-080"	"#C-080 (2003-12-17 (18)) After my exams were over and I was in my last meeting of Electronics class, Mr. Martenson kind of really like surprised us and said that he wanted to take us all on a trip to the beach and stay there overnight, and so that we could look at the sunset and the wave length and the frequencies of light and how they change. And I was really surprised that we were going without any further notice, without any bags, without any anything. [laugh] And so the kids in the class didn't really want me to go because they were afraid that I would get lost, that I wouldn't know where I was going and what I was doing, and stuff like that, like I've always had to deal with. And I was just kind of bull-headed and assertive and said that I've been to the beach lots of time with my family and that this will be nothing. And so next thing I know, I was there and we were all sitting around and talking and I was swimming with them in the water. And we just kind of swam around and I guess we stayed the night; I don't even remember too much. But when we got back to the house, it didn't even look like what I'm used to. It was this big, fancy, ornate lobby which they're known for and I had to get something out of his class, so I had to go upstairs. Oh, for some reason we were sitting in his classroom that was more like a living room, and it was dark and we were just all talking about the trip and what a wonderful time we had. And then we all went out and I was kind of going in the opposite direction of all the people and waiting for a minute or two because there was this whole table full of candy. They had like big dishes with lids on them, and I'm sure that anybody could just go in there and get some. But then I kind of lost interest. They hung around and they hung around, and I figured I had to get home and I think at the time I had the cell phone in my pocket, and I turned it on in case they needed to locate where I was. And they had this -- it must have been three stories, but it was real open and each story had real high ceilings -- and there was this roundy roundy round, real narrow staircase, just about my arm span wide. So I was hanging on, each hand to a railing on each side of this running down these stairs and spiraling around and around until I finally, I didn't even get to the bottom and I heard them calling my name on the intercom. And I couldn't really say anything or yell out that I was on the stairs or anything, and the office was right in front of the staircase. And the office had clear doors like the Learning Support Center does. And I can't remember actually reaching the bottom, but I remember being in the office and meeting up with Dad and not knowing what was going to happen after that. And then I woke up."
"C-081"	"#C-081 (2003-12-21 (18)) First I dream that, in addition to my three classes out at Westport College, I was taking a fourth one here at Westport High School, like a dual enrollment thing. So what I was supposed to do is go to Westport High School, be at that class from like 7:20 to 8:00 o'clock, then go out to Westport College and be at the next class by 8:30. So this class was taught by Ms. Burley, which was the teacher that I had my first semester of the 9th grade, and she was strange, bizarre, bland, and I could never figure her out. She taught critical thinking and learning skills, which was a really boring, stupid course. But in my dream she was teaching that class again, and I had to take her class at the college level, and it was like a dual enrollment thing, I guess. And Melinda was there, and I think I went to the first class, but I didn't go to that class any more after that. In my dream I only had three classes at Westport College and I only went to those three classes. And in my dream I had no idea what my classes were at Westport College, and I got a notice in the mail and a little card that had my exam score from Ms. Burley, and I had gotten a ""D"" on her exam. [laugh] And I was thinking to myself, ""Now gee, I don't even remember taking that exam. I don't even remember having that class, so what's up with this grade?"" Then I remembered I had the class, but I skipped it, all but one day, and I didn't take the exam. And then the scene kind of changed and I was at this picnic party that I think was at like the remote park like Lake Hiawatha, and we were -- it might have even been Clementine Springs, I'm not sure, but we were by some water and it was kind of a nice even temperature -- not real cold and not real warm. And there were trees around and there were picnic tables all over everywhere. And it was somebody's birthday. And there was this guy I knew who was kind of like my best friend, and there was supposed to be Melinda's family and some fireman people in the neighborhood. We were going to all get together for this man's birthday. Anyway, I had the Peavey system. Where I got power for it, I don't know. Don't ask me. [laugh] But anyway, that wasn't an issue in my dream. It was just supposed to run. And, let's see, there was a birthday cake, and here's the funny part: I had borrowed Astrid's keyboard because somebody was going to play and I didn't know how to, and it was set up and connected to the Peavey system and this guy was just jamming away, whose birthday it was. I didn't know who he was. And then I went off to do something else. I think I was running streamers from one tree to another. And then, before I knew it, I was back at the guy, and the thing turned into a cake. And I'm thinking, ""Oh, my gosh, what's Astrid going to say?"" [laugh] That was crazy. And that was a cake and everybody was cutting up and having a piece. Oh geez. And then the scene suddenly shifted and I was at this movie theater setting up the Peavey system there. There was supposed to be some kind of screening of some kind, some kind of VIP party, and things were really, really running late and it was kind of like I was going to be sitting around for the next few hours waiting for people. And then I woke up. That was a strange conglomeration of things. Also another funny part as this dream was ending and I was waking up and fading into consciousness and coming to, I thought back about my classes at Westport College, and I was thinking, ""Could I have really gotten that grade on that exam or what here?"" And I couldn't remember any of my classes. I had to think about when was my lunch hour. Then I remembered I had Electronics class, then I remembered Music and Computers class, and then I woke up a little more and remembered Psychology, but I couldn't remember the first one. And it wasn't until I was like fully awake for a few minutes that I remembered, oh, it was Business Law, which I was a little doubtful of how I was going to do on that exam, so that might be where this dream got started. Also another part of this dream could have come from the fact than when I interned at Memorial Stadium, during the baseball games they'd have all kinds of corporate plugs, people could win things and advertise a corporation. And Sam Ash Music sponsored a happy birthday thing for every game, and they would tell the birthdays of famous people. And they would show the organist's fingers playing ""Happy Birthday"" and then suddenly the picture would materialize into a birthday cake with a Sam Ash Music picture on it, so that might be a seed of that thought."
"C-082"	"#C-082 (2003-12-22 (18)) I had three classes to go to and that they were in the afternoon. The first one started at like 1:00, and why I keep dreaming about having to go to classes, don't ask me. I'm sick of dreaming that. But anyway, my first one started at 1:20 and it was like 1:16 and Mom was sitting at the dining table just writing and stuff like that, and I was telling her, ""You should go get the truck and bring it around. I'm going to be late for class."" And she said, ""No you won't; you'll be fine."" But it got to the point where I was shaking her by the shoulders and yelling and crying, telling her to get moving because I was going to be really late for class. And it was kind of hard because I was just screaming. And I can't remember, but I think it was like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" kind of blah. Then I was in this party room with these people and it was supposed to be something like a dance performance thing. It was going to be filmed on live TV and I was just kind of in the audience with the people. And it was a small room with a kind of a wooden floor, and it was, I think it was for the show ""Fame"" and I had the notion that ""Crispen"" won it last year--who the heck Crispen is, I don't know. And I was going in and out this room and going to the bathroom and few times, and then I came back and I was sitting around with people and they were talking about what they were going to do. And this one girl was doing some homework and needed to use bright (?) calculator, and it was really acting funny and we couldn't figure out why. And then suddenly I was, it was Dad out at this little tiny building that I guess resembled the church that we had the party at, but it was more like a movable portable facility than that. And we had to go there for some kind of business, but I wasn't real keen on going in there because I had heard that their alarm system was real unreliable and could pretty much go off at any time when somebody so much as shook the place the wrong way. And so I stood back a few feet while they opened the door, and things were okay in there. And in my dream I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't want to because I was afraid that sitting down on the toilet and going would either make the alarm off or I would be lucky enough to be in there when, just happen to. So I didn't, I kept walking around for a little bit, doing different things, getting stuff ready for some kind of event. And I finally went to the bathroom, and then I woke up, and I had to go when I woke up."
"C-083"	"#C-083 (2003-12-24 (18)) I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something. And we were in a band room and we were kind of being taught by a man, but instead of rehearsing or stuff, we were talking about Greek mythology and we were talking about how to go around and take the path and the journey to find Theseus (?). I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And Mom was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and Mom was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn't yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He's the cab dispatcher. And, oh, Mom was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don't remember ever getting there. And before that, I dreamt that I was investigating around by the tree, and that I had a longer, a box that was longer than it was wise and kind of not that high, and heavy and dense, and it was wrapped in green paper. Now I don't know if this is a prophetic image or if it's just wishful thinking, but I tend to believe it's just wishful thinking. And now I don't remember any more."
"C-084"	"#C-084 (2003-12-27 (18)) I was attending this special school for like handicapped people, I guess because they were an institution known to do a lot of help for people and make a lot of things go well for people, and so they thought it would be good for me to go and visit them and see what they could do for me. And, believe it or not, it was like this private school, K-12, and since this was my first year with them, they put me in a first grade class. [laugh] And I went to this first grade class for like two days, I think, and then I realized that this was not just a health institution that would try to help you. This was a school that they were going to try to put you through their twelve years of education no matter how old or young you were, and how many you'd already been through. And then the scene kind of shifted, and I was like, I had a place that I had, somebody had given me. It was like a dinky little apartment thing, and I was living on my own. Actually I was living on my own part of the time and living at home part of the time. And I was in this dinky little apartment getting some work done and stuff, and I called home and it was like 5:00 in the evening and Mom and Dad were like, ""Where the heck are you? If you're going to leave the house, you tell us first."" They didn't even know I had this place. And then I was, I think it was the next day, and I was going back to this place, I was going to bring them my high school diploma, show them that I had already graduated, show them that I was in college now and disconnect myself from them. So I went in the office and I had my high school diploma, and I chatted with the ladies; they seemed really nice. And I just told them, ""I don't wish to take any more classes here. Thank you."" And I walked out, and I showed them, and they seemed so impressed. I couldn't figure out what were they so impressed about? And I think shortly thereafter I was kind of in the phase of stage 1 sleep and waking up, and I was thinking how, I had the notion that the campus that I attended now of Westport College was really called Panella's Park High and it just had facilities for college students in the back forty, kind of like. But when I was fully awake, I realized that I was still attending Westport College. How come I keep having dreams about these educational conflicts? I keep dreaming that I'm back at Westport High School or that I'm not really where I am yet, I think because it's still for me to even believe."
"C-085"	"#C-085 (2003-12-29 (18)) Mom and I were coming home from a trip to Jackson and we were outside the airport and Josie and Bobby and Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and her and I were opening gifts. And the plane was like going to leave in five minutes. Then it came down to that we missed the plane because we were opening gifts, and I figured, ""Okay, we're just going to have to stay in Jackson for a few more hours until the next outgoing flight."" And that was kind of good because we could go to somebody's house and stay a little longer. Well, it just so happened that -- I know this is very unrealistic -- but Dad drove all the way up from Westportrsburg because he somehow found out that we missed the plane. See, we were going to tell him that our flight was cancelled, but somehow he found out that we missed the plane. And so he drove up and he was going to get us and bring us home, and he was mad, mad, mad at that old red hen, hen, hen. [laugh] And we also missed the Bryan Adams concert and I was jumping up and down and saying that, ""You have to take me to an equivalent one."" Something else, but I can't remember. And that's basically it. When I was waking up and realized that all this was a dream and that missing the plane was a dream and the concert was still on, I was real relieved."
"C-086"	"#C-086 (2003-12-31 (18)) I had the notion that I was interning at some kind of TV station like Time Warner, yet it was kind of like the Dome at where I was. And I think it was, I couldn't really figure out what it was, but I was in this control room and I had like all kinds of video equipment and a small like mixing board in the back. And there were like this real crowd of people in there. I couldn't figure out who they were, but this one guy was supposed to be the manager and his name was Derek, kind of like the guy we missed at Whitaker Hall, and there were a couple of guys that I thought I know, and there was a whole bunch of people that I didn't even know that I was kind of wondering why the heck were they there. And we were supposed to get this show on the road, and I was supposed to help somebody with something. And there were about four or five people crowded behind the board trying to do all do the same thing at once. [laugh] Gee, where have I heard this before? And, of course, I was just kind of sitting in a little corner observing all this commotion and ruckus going on, and then I kind of faded into another scene where I was walking down the sidewalk and I had to go through an obstacle course. And I was trying to tell somebody about my experience when I was going through an obstacle course. And one of the things I had to go through -- I didn't really have to go through anything but this one thing. In front of Jean's house where she has that fence, white picket fence, it kind of came out to the sidewalk and enclosed and made a box, and I had to crawl in the box and they close the door and then open it on the other side so I could get out. So when they closed the box, it was so small and tight, I could barely like move through it, and there was a top on it like I was in a bunny cage. And then I came out the other side of the bunny cage and I went on my way and I was okay. But when I was in the bunny cage, I thought I'd never get out of it. I think this came from when I was like 3 and used to sit in the bunny cage and feed the bunny, but I never used to mind because I could get out from the inside."
"C-087"	"#C-087 (2003-12-31 (18)) I was back at Westport High School again -- I can't get away from dreaming about Westport High School and other schools I've been to [laugh] . But anyway, it was either -- I think it was a cross between Westport High School and Oceanside Elementary. And I was skating on roller skates through the hallway, I think because I was just there to kind of help out with something. I wasn't really there to actually go. And I can't remember too much except I was in PE class again, and we were doing jumping jacks out in the courtyard thing."
"C-088"	"#C-088 (2004-01-02 (18)) For some reason we were going to a baseball game, but I wasn't going to like do any DJ'ing or anything like that. I was going to like sit and watch the game, and we were hoping that I could like sit in the press box and go to the sound booth or something like that. And we were describing who we were and Mom just casually mentioned that I graduated from high school. And the lady whisked us and said, ""Here, let's put you in the graduate section."" And there was like a VIP area for people who had graduated from high school. And she took us off down this little hall and brought us in this little booth. It was kind of like a sound-proof booth. And they passed out -- there were like five of us in there and there was one lady. I was sitting up on a high stool so that I could actually see down and out the window what was going on. And, of course, I couldn't always see what was going on in the field, but I could see all the people in the bleachers and stuff. And this lady was like in her 70's, and she was like, ""Can I trade with you?"" And so I sat on the far right, down on the lowest stool I could, and I couldn't even see up above the window. And she sat in the middle in between like the five of us. There were like three boys and only two girls. And she passed out like snacks and little prizes to us; it was like complimentary things that came with being in that section. And we were supposed to get to hear all kinds of like inside stuff, but they didn't send it over our system. Ours -- and get this -- this was the craziest part -- the system that they had us hear did not carry the songs that, the periodic songs and announcements that Bobby mixed, and apparently we were just supposed to watch the game without sound. And they played teenage rap and R&B stuff over the system that we heard. And that was crazy. I wanted to hear Bobby's mix. And I was thinking about how, when I was there at regular games in the sound booth, and I got to listen in on him talking about what to do and when to do it, I missed hearing all that because that was like really the inside scoop, the ultimate inside scoop. And, of course, to be able to coordinate it to listening to Bobby's mix and looking at the monitor when I could see what the video person was doing. And also there's another part to this dream that I remember. Before any of that, I dreamt that I was having a sleep-over birthday party with Astrid and Linda and Darlene and one or two other people from the Wilcox Center. I think Frieda must have been there too. And I think we had like just woke up and we were going down to have breakfast. For some reason Linda and me and one other girl were sitting on a towel eating in front of the TV. And Linda was bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me, like she does, about letting her go into my studio and make a copy of a CD. And [laugh] she wanted a copy of like Ace of Base and now that I think of it, I don't know why the heck she would want that one because she doesn't like that kind of stuff. But in my dream that's what she wanted a copy of. And I was thinking of how, when Mom gets breakfast on and everyone's eating breakfast, I'll just run up there, make a copy real fast and bring it down and give to Linda so she'll have it and I won't have to have her mess through all my stuff and everything. And then when I got in there and I was sitting down to make the copy, I realized that I didn't have an original, and therefore the STMS was going to scream and yell in my face, and so I had to put in my personal CD player and do an analog. And that's when I kind of woke up. [laugh]"
"C-089"	"#C-089 (2004-01-07 (18)) I don't know exactly where to start because this was another one of those rambling saga-like type dreams, but I'll start at the part that I can remember the best. I dreamt that -- I think this is where it starts -- I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn't know if I was at Westport College or Modern Media College, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who's the sound engineer, great. He's left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hollander B3 organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his 70's. He was kind of in his 70's or 80's and he kind of barely knew what he was doing. [laugh] And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn't getting much out of it because I couldn't see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play like chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was like bad, to say the least! [laugh] He was like, I don't know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn't know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn't go with anything that was going on. And then, I don't know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that Dad and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don't remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember -- this is kind of crazy, man. I don't know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It's one of those things where you think it's going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don't know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it's there, and we were like getting settled and stuff and we're ready to take off, and I'm ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it's the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And [laugh] the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie [laugh] , that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that's bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man -- as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don't ask me! [laugh] But it's becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla's favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don't know, it's called ""Farralene"" (?), it goes [singing] and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it's not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don't know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess."
"C-090"	"#C-090 (2004-01-08 (18)) I know there was more to it, but this is all I can remember so far. First of all, information: sometimes when the chickens get elderly, they get kind of in poor condition, and some age better than others, I guess, just like people. But in my dream there was this white chicken and Dad wanted to wash her off on her back side because she was really getting messy. And so he was going to, he wanted to see if I could hang onto the chicken for him, and he was thinking of putting her in one of the like a harness thing, like you would a dog. And I said, ""I don't think so. I will hold the chicken with my arms and keep her from getting away."" And so, sitting on the picnic table with the chicken, she's white, but she kind of has the build and weight of a Rhode Island Red, and they're kind of hard to contain because we only have one left, and she's a red Rhode Island Red, but for some reason in my dream, she was white. And I'm holding the chicken and he's dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dallying around, and I can't figure out why. And then I say that I need to, I realize that it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven't had lunch, so and the chicken looks hungry too, believe it or not. So I tell him that he should hold the chicken for a minute so that I can go get some seeds. I went inside and got a bite of my plate and I was kind of disappointed because I was smelling fried food in the chicken, but what I got was only a baloney sandwich. Then I came back out with some seed for the chicken, and I guess that kept her busy for a few minutes, and then we continued the operation. And he was telling me how bad she was looking, how it looked like she had a ton of bacteria and stuff because one time one of our chickens was like in bad shape. And then I think we were done and I let the chicken go. And there was this truck that was going by that had sirens on it and back-up alarms going forward, and I like fell to the ground and rolled over and laid there until it passed. And I can't remember anything more."
"C-091"	"#C-091 (2004-01-12 (18)) We were up in the territory of Modern Media College and I only had like two or three days, maybe even two or three hours before I started classes there. And we were like outside in like a park area, and I had to go into the building to use the bathroom, and I needed to ask the counselor and the secretary for a calendar of like time off and stuff like that. And so I went in this like real just blah building and it was like the lady who came out wouldn't let me go any further until I showed her my ID and I could prove that I was going to be a student in a few days. And I dreamt that there was this man counselor that I knew that she directed me towards that I had a feeling that I had had a real technical discussion with before, and that I felt real comfortable with. And he wanted to know if I had decided what kind of mixer board was best for me, and I told him I hadn't yet. And I got the calendar and I went back outside and then I woke up."
"C-092"	"#C-092 (2004-01-13 (18)) I don't know if this is all going to fit, but I'm going to try. Last night I had a dream that I was at this theme park, and I can remember bits and pieces of it. Bad me -- I let it drag on until it's 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon now, but I didn't have time to record it this morning when I first woke up. So I dreamt that I was at a theme park with Melinda, and it was kind of a school field trip like type thing. And there was this ride called the Kumba Roller Coaster -- it was either the Kumba or the Montu -- it was kind of like Six Flags. And we'd go on this roller coaster and we'd roller coaster around. It would be an ""Ahhhhhhhhhh!"" thrill ride. There was also this ride that I liked that was a slide that would like spray you with water as you were sliding down this big, tall slide, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you were going by, like it had a really neat sound system, which that and spraying water just don't go together, but maybe they did. I think I heard something like that at some kind of theme park, and that's where I got the idea from. And once you got down to the bottom of this big slide, you'd fall into this swimming pool that was really deep and you like swam to the other end, and that was okay. And we only had a little bit of time left, but I wanted Melinda to go on this slide with me, and she said, ""No, no, I'm too chicken; you have to go by yourself."" And so I went, but it was kind of funny because the slide wouldn't spray me with the water and there was no sound. All that it was, was that you could slide down the slide and that was it. And I imagined in my dream that this slide was pink and that the pool was pink, instead of blue like they usually are. And so, sorry folks, the tape is coming to an end. I will start over on the next one. Alright, I don't expect this tape to last me more than about a month's worth of material, maybe even less, but it's just a junky marketing tape anyway, and it's no good for anything else, and this is better than having it thrown in the garbage. So, let us begin! I am going to start over and repeat a dream that I wasn't able to fit on the last tape. It is now close to 9:00 o'clock at night and I am kind of fortunate that even part of it has stayed with me this long because I just didn't have the time to do it this morning. So anyway, I dreamt that I was at this amusement park, and I was there with Melinda, and it was kind of like Six Flags, except in my dream it didn't really have a name. And we were like on this school field trip and her and I were kind of running around together, and I think everybody else kind of just ditched us. And we were like running around going on these rides. There was this huge, open park picnic area in the middle of the park that kind of reminded me of Westport College Quad, except that it had like picnic tables and stuff and like amusement park type fencing and white-colored tables. And there was this one ride that was like the Mod II or the Kumba, and it was just a roller coaster. You would have to walk up very high to get to it though, like a boardwalk; you'd have to climb stairs and go up ramps and snakes and winds, kind of like you have to do when you're at a theme park, except this was all in the open and on a like a wooden boardwalk. And I wanted to get Melinda to go on that, and I think maybe we did, but I have no memory of actually being on a ride. Then there was this other ride that I really, really liked supposedly, and it was supposedly a pink slide that you would slide down and it would spray you with water from the side, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you'd be going by. Now spraying water and a cool sound system don't exactly go together, but, you know, in theme parks sometimes they may have everything all water-tight. And I was trying to get Melinda to go down this slide with me because we only had a little bit of time left and I wanted to make us do this before we had to go. And the slide was pink and I went down it; she was too chicken. And it didn't spray and the water and it didn't make the sounds. It was just like a slide, because I think the park was like going to close, but I didn't feel like it was. And then I like landed in this pool of water, like you would expect at most theme park rides, slide things, and when I first landed in it, the pool had a pink bottom instead of a blue bottom like they usually do. And then as I was swimming behind this other girl, and I became aware that I was swimming over like a grate venting and my feet were about to touch the bottom, then the pool turned blue like they usually are. And you know how in dreams when you dream about swimming, or at least I do, the water like tosses you around and you like, you sink to the bottom as though gravity were holding you down, but you can still breathe by some miracle? This is how I always dream when I dream about swimming in a pool. I don't know why. Usually the water wants to pull me up because I'm a female and I have the female fat buoyancy thing. Dad just sinks like a rock. But anyway, I have to really fight to get down and stay down if I want to dive under water, but in my dream I just sort of sink and I can still breathe. [laugh] But anyway, enough of that. And so, I don't know how I got myself like all dried off and everything in such a hurry, but we went back to this like classroom that was at the theme park and there was a TV, they were going to show a movie. And I was kind of thinking, ""I want to sit where I can see the movie,"" because I thought it was going to be halfway interesting, but Melinda said, ""Nah, nah, let's sit over here in this section where we can goof around and nobody will see us!"" And it was close to one of those like candy machines that they have at Westport College. And before anything else could happen, I woke up."
"C-093"	"#C-093 (2004-01-16 (18)) I had kind of a typical dream, something you would expect from somebody who has a class that they're going to the next day. I was dreaming that I was up at the right time and all and waiting for the cab, but instead of the cab coming for me, Melinda and Chelsea showed up at the door, and Mom and I got in their van thing, and we were riding along and Melinda and Chelsea decided to take us to Mr. Denton's house. Mr. Denton was my economics teaching in my senior year that, I don't know, he thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all his kids were really kind of ""blah"" anyway, and so was his class. And so he thought I was just so intelligent and so wonderful, but anyway, we went to Mr. Denton's house and they took a bunch of pictures. And he still had his Christmas things up. And we, I was looking at his little village scene set up things and they were really cool. And then we went to the beach, of all places. And we bummed around at the beach, and we were talking about various different things, I can't remember what. And then finally they decided that they were going to take me back to class, and I got there in time for Speech class, but I had totally skipped Ethics class. And I was trying to persuade Mom not to show the pictures from Mr. Denton's class to Dad because he would know that I skipped Ethics class. And I think Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to go somewhere and they were going to come back for me for lunch, but I woke up before any of that happened. Oh, and I dreamt that I was real afraid because the cab people were going to say I was a no-show, so they'd automatically cancel the return trip, and so Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to come and get me and we were going to go have some more fun after my class. And then I woke up."
"C-094"	"#C-094 (2004-01-18 (18)) I finally got the gift that I had been wanting for some time. And, you know, I've been having these dreams. So I finally had it, and it was finally in my closet and I was so proud. And Dad was going to help me set it up in my sound studio, but first I had to learn how to flush the toilet without making it clog up. [laugh] And the trick of it was you had to hold down the handle until just after the stuff had made it down, and then let it go immediately after that. And if you didn't let it go, or you let it go too soon, the whole thing would be for naught, which for real life, in both of our toilets, we have to hold it down, but it's not the end of the world if we let it go too soon. So a couple, I tried it like three times, but it didn't really work right, and we had this big Jacuzzi like tub in the upstairs bathroom and Dad had to take a dream clog stopper out of the tub to kind of let some more air into the pipes, I guess. That was crazy. And, oh my gosh, there was a big flash of lightning outside. But anyway, I can't remember what happened after that, but somebody was going on a plane somewhere. I think it wasn't going to be Mom and I going up to Jackson. I think it was going to be Dad and Mom going somewhere, and I was finally going to get to investigate my gift. And I woke up before any of that could happen and realized it was a dream. If I keep having all these stupid dreams, I'm not going to know the real thing if it does happen. [laugh]"
"C-095"	"#C-095 (2004-01-20 (18)) First of all, I think the first, I had a lot of elements that were real fragmented, now when I think about it. But I think I laid through a lot of stage one, just kind of half conscious awareness from 5:30 to 6:00 this morning, so that's how it got all fragmented. But some elements that I can remember first is that my application into Modern Media College I was pretty sure was going to be rejected for some reason, and I had kind of resigned myself to the thought that I just can't be in the sound business because my vision prevents me from doing some, perceiving and acting socially, and I think I move around too slowly on some of the programs and there's no way in the world that I can operate these big huge mixer boards. Now this is all what I'm thinking in my dream, as I'm standing in this yellow room with big boards all over everywhere, almost like our kitchen is now, except it was huge like a warehouse. And I was just standing there thinking, and I had the feeling like there were like tons of people around me, but nobody was saying anything, I didn't hear anything. I was just thinking all of this. [blowing noise] Ummmm, a big blob of snot! Anyway, now that that's out of the way, then the next scene that I can remember is that I was at home. It was like the night before I had classes, like last night was, and I was sick with some kind of cold or flu or something, and I was laying on the couch with Mom and we were kind of almost asleep. And I was singing to her. And I had some kind of thing where I still couldn't go to sleep and I had to get up and take some kind of medicine, so she got up with me. And we went in the kitchen, which was kind of normal, the way it used to be, and she had me take a few pills by drinking down some water and taking them. And then she gave me applesauce that had like peanuts chopped up in it, and I think I ate it and it was good, and as I was eating it, I woke up. [laugh] That was kind of crazy, but I think this is a very telling dream that brings out some of the inhibitions that I have and this subconscious fear that I have, that no matter how hard I try, I'm not going to be capable in this field. And even if I were to realize that, I would be just devastated, and I'd probably be like a societal hermit for the rest of my life. At this point I don't know what else to do with my life. I know that's bad, but it is, it's true. And I guess I've been thinking a lot about going away. I've already started a little box of stuff, and I practiced filling out a practice application on last year's, in last year's catalog, and it slipped down behind my bed. And I figured, ""Oh heck, it's just last year's scrap copy anyway; it doesn't matter."" And I even had a duplicate in my catalog, but I think that might have had something to do with it."
"C-096"	"#C-096 (2004-01-21 (18)) Astrid and me were at Westport College together, and we were in this office waiting to see our degree program advisor, and I had the feeling it was supposed to be, I was already seeking an audio degree at Westport College. And I can't remember the exact title, but I remember thinking in my dream back to an experience that I felt kind of inferior, when we were in a class, kind of it looks like kind of at Modern Media College with a huge mixer board, and there was this one guy who was doing most of the work in the hands-on learning. And the other five or six of us -- there were like ten others of us -- and we were just standing there watching. And I figured, ""How am I ever going to learn if I keep going at this rate?"" [laugh] And so I was thinking about that when we were sitting in this office. You know how they have the U line, the queue thing? Well, it was dark and they were playing a movie for us while we were waiting because we had to wait like forever and a day. And then I think I had a memory that I was going to ask Uncle Robert if he could lend me his copy of ""A New Day Has Come"" because it was in surround sound, and I was just dying to hear the thing mixed in surround sound, which in real life the truth of the matter is that I saw it in a collection of others in Sound & Vision. And whenever I listen to it, I think, ""Man, would this be great mixed in surround sound!"" And so I was going to borrow it from him and play it on his sound system, since he had a SA CD player, and I think when we were standing in that office waiting for that guy, I was like crying about something, I don't know what! And we were supposed to like, I don't even know what we were going to say. I didn't even know if we were going to see a man advisor or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Ms. Maggot from Stephen King's memoir, and I think I was going to see somebody like her. And so then I dreamt that I was at Uncle Larry's house -- how I shifted to that scene, I don't know. But instead of being at Uncle Robert's, I was at Uncle Larry's house and I was going to play ""A New Day Has Come"" in surround sound, but somehow I woke up before I could do that. That was kind of dumb, wasn't it?"
"C-097"	"#C-097 (2004-01-23 (18)) One other note about this dream -- first of all, it kind of scares me to think that I came in at the top of the building and I went down. If that's going to be how my career's going to go, that's a ""Pppppppt!"" But anyway, the path and elevation is that I came in at the top and I went down and around, and I helped somebody while I was down. Then I went back up and I felt really claustrophobic and tight. And one thing about that little attic space that was supposed to be a recording booth, there was nothing in it except a toy teddy bear and a party hat. Now tell me what that's about! [laugh] But anyway, there was no sound board or anything; it was just a toy teddy bear and a party hat. And then I went down, and I went outside, and then everything seemed to be going good outside. So I don't know what all that's about. Also I didn't taste any of the little desserts and things that were laying out, but I looked at them, so I think all this could be pieced together in that maybe when I get to the very top of my career, somebody's going to act really immature and keep me in a very tight, confined, pretty conservative little area, not physically, but mentally. And then when I get a little more space and I'm a little more established, I'll be outside feeling good and bold to do anything I want. And understand that all of this is what my mind is seeing, it's not necessarily, I don't believe, that these dreams are saying psychic things about this is what's going to happen to you in the future. It's what my inner eye sees, or thinks is going to happen to me. It's nothing guaranteed, so that's my take on that."
"C-098"	"#C-098 (2004-01-27 (18)) I was taking this music class on Saturdays from 10:00 to 11:00 at Westport College, and it was kind of put that way loosely because we could go whenever we wanted. And it was supposed to be so that it could be getting credit without actually interfering with the rest of my schedule. And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it's kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It's really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I've been listening to, I think that's just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot. And I dreamt that Merrilee was involved in all this because she was kind of the music teacher's assistant, and they were holding this seminar on a Saturday, and they weren't sure who was coming. And I said I was coming, but I didn't know about anybody else. And that's pretty much it, I think."
"C-099"	"#C-099 (2004-01-28 (18)) I was up half the night just kind of goofing around and I was so upset because I couldn't get to sleep. And then I really woke up and I knew that I had gotten some sleep."
"C-100"	"#C-100 (2004-01-28 (18)) And then I went back to sleep and had a dream about Modern Media College. I dreamt that, first of all -- this is the crazy part -- I think I've been watching too much TV -- there were these four or five people in my room that were kind of talking to us and all, and there was this one boy who wanted to see my DP program because he wanted to learn to mix too. And I said I'm going to come back and show it to him, and I went and told Mom. These four girls were the ones they weren't sure about. Apparently I had the notion they had been discovered in a room that had a meth lab underneath it. Oh, my gosh, I don't know what's up for that. But after that scene I was at Modern Media College, which really I started off being at Westport College and I sort of found myself there at Modern Media College, and it was a real maze. I came in with Mom and Dad, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And Mom and Dad kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I didn't taste any of the treats; I don't know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I -- oh, before that -- this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six-channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, ""Oh thanks, they belong here."" And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and Mom and Dad were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, ""Nobody can get in here like this."" He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I don't know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos [?] and finally I brought up my master a little. And I went back to my seat and then I woke up."
"C-101"	"#C-101 (2004-01-29 (18)) Dad was in my studio surfing the internet on my machine for some reason, looking for gosh only knows what. And he was on the phone talking to somebody and I thought that he might have brought up one of my journal entries from my folder full of stuff, and so I just kind of said, ""Dad, I'm sorry, but this is time and you have to move, you have to let me close this out."" I closed it out and underneath it was the website that he had been looking at, and next thing I knew, I was sitting down in the chair and he was on the phone talking to some relatives. It was like I was listening in on a conversation almost. And I wasn't really on a website for any purpose; I was just exploring it. And apparently it was like a, you know the front of a Christmas cherub's (?) box that was real kind of crazy colors? That's what the theme of the website was for some reason. And I was kind of thinking, ""Okay, I can do a search on the internet for anything I want."" And shortly after that I woke up."
"C-102"	"#C-102 (2004-01-30 (18)) I was at like a fair thing with Mom. I can't remember if Dad was there or not, and I think that Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry were in this somewhere. Oh, and I think Merrilee was there. Mom and me and Merrilee were walking into this little park thing. It was kind of like a scaled-down Six Flags, and we walked in this path of flowers and little animals in cages and stuff, and then at a certain fork in the path, there was this sign that Mom read to me and it said, ""Piggy Zoo Zoo."" [laugh] And it was kind of funny. Mom said that we're going to have to go into this auditorium, and we went in and we were seeing this like play. And Mom met up with Dad and Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry, and Merrilee kind of disappeared. And they went and sat in the seats in this play, and I stayed behind and I sat at a table in the back of the theater facing the wall, meaning that my left shoulder was facing the stage and my right was facing the door. And I was in this little entrance way hallway and I was facing a wall to the right. And I was doing homework, and I was listening to them doing their play while I was doing my homework. And for whatever reason, I had this tape machine. I think I was listening to like notes I took from class, like if I had recorded a lecture, and I was like listening to that intermittently, and get this -- the main actor onstage came off the stage, came all the way back to where I was and said, ""Excuse me, Ma'm, but you cannot be taping this for any reason at all, any reason."" And so I was really embarrassed and I shoved it in my bag, even though I wasn't recording, but then I can't remember a whole lot after that. I think we were listening to this play some more, and then we went out and then we came back to like a hotel room. And Dad was there and we were talking about something, I don't remember what. And then I woke up."
"C-103"	"#C-103 (2004-02-01 (18)) First of all, we had our PC over on the desk in the foyer like we have, that kind of squarish desk. Then for some reason on the roll-top desk we had a Mac in addition to mine upstairs. Now I think that was because somebody who went to the school system regularly needed to print out grades, and they had to print out grades on this special perforated paper that would only print in that kind of a printer. And so in my dream I had a solution to my writing dilemma. I would compose my stories up here, then take then down there on a CD and print them there because the printer would take perforated paper or regular paper. And the roll-top desk in my dream was like a huge, grand and stately thing. And, you know, I don't remember a whole lot else. Let's see, you know, it's a bummer. I don't remember anything else that happened, but what I can say is that I did a lot of typing for an ethics report yesterday and reading, Mom did a bunch of reading and I had the system on while I was doing a lot of this. And when I would look up to kind of rest my eyes, I would see, I would be looking at the desk from like right up next to it, and so it would look really huge. You know, all the shelves that are up there; that's what I'm talking about."
"C-104"	"#C-104 (2004-02-02 (18)) I was going with Dad to this big expansive, empty parking lot to take the Peavey system and practice my speech. And he said, ""Okay, we're going to leave in a few minutes,"" and I realized I didn't have my personal CD player or any of the other accessories that I need for here to give my speech. And so I figured it would be better to delay things and make them wait a little than to get there and be totally unprepared. So I took a paper bag and I dropped in my personal CD player, the mini disk recorder, some cables, my wireless mike receiver and the wireless mike itself. And then I was thinking, ""Okay, I'm ready to run out the door."" And then I realized I don't have the XLR cable to connect the receiver to the board. The wireless mike receiver connects to the board with an XLR, and I realized I didn't have that so I had to dig it out of my drawer. And also I realized I had to dig out the transformer that powers the wireless mike receiver. I had to look in a few places and finally I found it and I threw all that in a bag and I was running out the door, and then I realized it was dark out. I had taken most of the day to get this stuff ready. And each time I would put something in the bag, I would turn and run out the door and, I mean, out of my door and halfway down the stairs and realized that I had forgotten one more thing. And I'd come back and I'd put it in and I'd run down half the stairs, and then I was, ""Oh, I forgot one more thing."" And by the time I was all done with it, it was dark, and we just decided that we would go tomorrow. And then I woke up. [laugh]"
"C-105"	"#C-105 (2004-02-06 (18)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Lee and Nikki and probably Jason were all in town again and they were all in our house. And it was like they had all flown in and I think Samantha and Sandra and I were visiting, and I think we took a walk around the park and everybody but Samantha ran ahead, and Mom and Dad and I and Samantha were on this walk, and I was -- see, this is a dream within a dream again. I dreamt that I had this dream that Connor had given me like a miniature guitar thing as a souvenir from his show; not a real one, but, you know, like a, I guess like a little refrigerator magnet, hang it on your mirror type of thing. It was like on the end of a graduation tassel. And I dreamt that I was telling all this to Dad and Mom and Samantha. And Dad was like, ""Now, what would be the point of that?"" And we couldn't convince him because it was a lack of facts. And now that I think of it, I don't think that would be something that he would really think bad about, but in my dream he did. He was going on about, ""What would be the point of that?"" And why in the world would somebody do something like that? But then again, in real life he's always doing insane things that I'd never guess he would, so I guess that's where that would come from. And then suddenly the scene shifted and we were at home, and it was like bedtime because it was like 9:30 or 10:00 at night, and, you know, we think it's bedtime, but they go on hours into the night. So this is the crazy part! Samantha and Sandra and Derek and me and Nikki were all going to sleep in the same bedroom downstairs, the master bedroom, with Mom and Dad. They were all going to sleep in the same room! [laugh] And I was going to be up here all nice and peaceful and quiet and everything. And for whatever reason, I took out the mermaid doll and I shoved it under my pillow for some reason, and I was getting adjusted and I heard them all jumping up and down and screaming, laughing, having a good time. So I figure, ""Okay, I'm missing something, so I'll go down there and check it out."" And Samantha and Sandra and the guys were kind of wrestling. I don't know where Mom and Dad were, but then I realized that I was totally naked and was probably embarrassing everybody but Samantha and Sandra, and I said, ""Oh, fashion, fashion,"" and they covered kind of my chest. And Sandra took each of my hands in hers and spread them all wide and kind of showed me to them, and was like, ""Yeah, fashion!"" [laugh] And that was okay because, of course, it was Sandra. And so then I came back up here again and Sandra and I kind of talked about what, I do not know. And then I was resting again, and then I could overhear Mom was in her workroom and Samantha was in there talking about how bummed I was because of what Dad said about my dream thing. Oh, and Derek and Louise came up here because they wanted to listen to some news in the bedroom, and it didn't work, so they asked if they could turn on mine and I saw, ""Sure."" So I moved over to the left side of the bed here and I let them sit down on the right side, and I think Nikki was there too. And my radio turned into a TV and they were watching TV and they were watching TV, and I figured, ""Alright, I'm going on the couch."" So I went on the couch, and that's all I can remember, and then I woke up."
"C-106"	"#C-106 (2004-02-12 (18)) Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were in town, and Uncle Charlie was listening to my mini disk machine because I was like showing it to him, and there were some audio files on one of the things there that he was listening to. And for some reason I was going on a website that I could look at the results of the Top 40 countdown, and the songs were listed from like 40 to 1 and they had these little icons next to them with pictures that were supposedly the pictures of the CD covers but really had nothing to do with the song. I think that comes from like in Word documents and things, you have a list and you've got these big icons and list information, and it's just all over in your face, which is how I like it. But that's the way it is. I was doing that, and I kind of left it there because I had a feeling that he was going to want to see it. And then I went out in the front yard where they were, and I discovered that Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were then sitting, laying in this like silk tent in our front yard. They had like pillows and blankets and sleeping bags and stuff in it, and they were literally camped out in our front yard. And I couldn't figure out why, but this is the really crazy part -- Uncle Charlie had these butterfly stickers -- not really stickers, but laminated pieces of cardboard with shiny hologram butterflies on them and birds and all kinds of crazy stuff, pictures of bicycles and birds and cars and just stuff, and they were all squares the size of mini disks, and he could slide them into the mini disk player instead of lifting the lid with the latch. He would slide them into to this like a slot, and he had this like projector thing in his pants, and he would hold the unit so that the front of it could send an infrared signal to the projector saying it would project it on a screen in my pants! And he was looking at jpeg pictures and seeing these crazy hologram butterflies up on the projector thing, and hearing audio files too, not just through the player, but on a sound system in there and stuff. It was crazy! And then I think I woke up."
"C-107"	"#C-107 (2004-02-14 (18)) I had a crazy dream about DBS mainly, which is kind of crazy because I never dream about them. But first in this dream I kind of had the notion that I was riding with Dad in the truck in the middle of the night with my bag of stuff and the Peavey system, and we were going on a long, three-hour trip to do a DJ gig somewhere, but I don't actually remember doing the gig. I don't remember coming home, I don't remember where it was, I just know that I was sort of getting ready. Then Mom and I -- I think I do remember getting home from the gig and Mom had to take me to the DBS office to pick up some paper, and they had this big, huge complex, not just a little office in a big building, like they have. And so we walked over there when we got there, and we were just going to pick up the paper and leave, but Carolyn wanted to talk to me. And somebody else did too, so I can't remember anything about what I said, but I think I said, ""Hi, hello,"" to Carolyn. And then there was this other person. She was kind of younger than Carolyn, but she was a little more kind of uppity like, just a little. And we were going around, I don't remember why, but she gave some kind of direction to Mom. They had this like field area out in the back that was for mobility training, and she wanted Mom and I to walk to it. And it was like a street, like a city street, with like just empty fields and nothing on either side. And how that could be anything big for trade, I don't know. And so we started walking down this road and I realized that there were these -- every so often in certain places, there were these like cover things, but they weren't covered, and half was silver and half was black. And when you would step on them, you would get an electric shock because apparently they wanted to do like conditioning to keep you in the middle of the street. And ever so often there would be one on either side, and if you stepped on it, I guess the silver half was the positive and the black half was the negative. I don't know, you'd have to be between the two of them, because you know how that goes. I think I had my white cane with me that time, and even when it would, when my tip would touch it, I would feel it through my hand, which I don't know why because my tip is plastic and the aluminum part is really insulated really well by the rubber top. I don't know, I guess I just wasn't thinking when I created this dream. And so we were going along, and at first I didn't mind, we were walking along and it was kind of pitch dark and we could see where the street was, but sometimes they'd have them in the middle of our path. Then they got to the point where they weren't just every so often. They were like all over, and they were getting bigger with more voltage on them, so it felt stronger. Mom still didn't mind them, so then she was carrying me over some of them, and she was getting them all and she was going, ""Ooh, ah,"" but she didn't mind them. I was like petrified and she kind of didn't care. And there was no like turning back around and going back because this path was like a circle; it would lead you back to the building. We got back to the building and we had to go upstairs for some reason because there was a bathroom in there, and they had you take a shower after you've been on this trip, if people have any feet yet, if they're not black yet. But, you know, the really wild part, after we were on that trip I noticed that there were a few here or there inside the building, and so by that time I was like afraid to take any step in any one direction because these things, I didn't know where the heck they were and when they were going to pop up. And in some cases, when we would be in the hallway, they wouldn't be there, and sometimes they would just pop up, except in the building they wouldn't be black and silver; they would blend in with whatever was around. And so I never did take my shower as prescribed, but I had to go up and down the elevator, which wasn't just for anybody to use. Somebody had to specially activate it for us, so we went down the stairs a few times too, and we noticed how steep the stairs were. So Mom and I had to make a sign that said, ""Beware, drops off."" And I was kneeling on one stair and laying on the other, and there was the most awful smell on the stairwell, like gym sweat. And somebody was coming up beside us, and I moved over and left them pass, and I finished my sign and then I stuck it up there. And then we went down the stairs, and then, thank goodness, that fiasco was over. Then my dream continues though, we met up with Dad at the Coliseum and Mom and Dad were conferring outside and I went in and I was giving our information to the person at the desk, like how old am I, how old is the person I'm with, this and that and the other. And it was more like applying for, applying for some kind of government aid just to get into a dance. And the guy said he had a check for me because I had made that long trip and did a Peavey system gig. And so it ended up that I didn't have to pay to get into the dance, but he paid me for something. And so it turned out, just before I woke up, me and Dad and Mom, we sat outside in the lobby and were eating some kind of lunch before the dance really got started. Now what I don't understand is when I was on the DBS mobility trail, the ________ mobility trail, I don't understand why it was totally dark outside and here at the Coliseum it was broad daylight. Oh well, that's one of the aspects of the dream. The next dream stems from a lot of things, the first thing being that I always have had something inside of me about covers, but they've always either just popped up or sprayed water or something. I've never had anything electrical going on. I think it's because now, whenever I handle the Peavey system outside, I'm conscious of it. Even this last time I practiced my speech, I was on the sidewalk and everything was dry, and I was still feeling a little bit of something. So I put on my shoes, and, of course, the fears went away, but still I'm more conscious of that now. And also I don't know where DBS comes into the picture; I guess because I'm becoming more independent lately and some people just don't know how independent I can be, not them, but some people I know. And we had to fill out a long, lengthy f___ application so the guy at the Coliseum desk asking me all those question fits in just fine. And he paying me for a Peavey gig is, I guess, because I got several scholarship checks in the mail, and that's the end of that."

And he looked me in the face and he said, ""I'm going to make a deal with you -- you come with me and I'll keep your secret quiet."" I guess I kind of like bit his hand and he let me go and I went in the store. I was supposed to meet up with Mom and I never did, and then I met up with her eventually. And then the TV people, some news people were calling me because they wanted me to go on TV for half an hour and talk about what had happened. Somehow that got misconstrued, and instead of that we were going to talk about what it was like for a local girl to be in the snow for the first time, and that was really silly. And I don't remember anything else in this dream, and then I woke up."
"C-109"	"#C-109 (2004-02-17 (18)) There was something going on before, but I don't remember what it was. All I remember now about this dream was that I was having my whole room, my studio, repainted, and not just that, but we were having the kitchen and I think the stairwell and the studio repainted, maybe even Mom's room. And some things were all messed up and turned upside down and messed around, and you know how it is. And I was in my room here, and they had just finished repainting it, and it was twice the size that it usually is, I think because when we were repainting it when I was 16 just before my birthday, we did repaint it, and it was like, it looked twice the size when all the shelves and everything were out, and my desk was out because it was being repainted. And anyway, I came in and they were starting to move furniture back in, in my studio after the paint job, and my desk was like big and black and the top was wooden, but the bottom was like plastic, you know how modern things are. And on my south wall there was this cart with like a ton of books on the bottom and a ton of CD's on the top, and it was like real ____ and said that it came from like a friend who was cleaning out the closet. And I could go through their CD's and books and keep any of the ones that I wanted for like DJ stuff. And so I started looking through them in a very orderly manner, and I laid a few on the side that looked like good party mixes that I was going to put on and listen to once my sound system was back together, because only furniture, but nothing else, was in there at this point. And then Dad came in when I had like two or three laid aside, and he was saying something like, ""Do you think you can put all this stuff back together?"" meaning the sound system and all the equipment. And he said, ""Then after you do that, you can resume and maintain your privacy,"" or something like that, and I said, ""Sure, I think I can do that."" So even though it was like a monumental task -- not only the sound system, but the mixer and the computer and everything was like all, all the components and everything were just laid out on my bed. And he was like, ""I think that attempt is going to fail. I know it's going to fail."" And then I woke up."
"C-110"	"#C-110 (2004-02-18 (18)) I had to take three more classes at Westport College this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that Dad had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can't remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, ""Oh Shenandoah."" And he was also, he knew ""This Land is Your Land,"" and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, ""Wow, isn't this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing."" And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don't know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching Dad play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and Mom was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I've still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it's an online thing. And that's pretty much it in a nutshell."
"C-111"	"#C-111 (2004-02-20 (18)) I was in this kind of semi-dark house with a tile floor, and there was a stairway like ours and there was a light on in the stairwell. But I was sitting like on a wooden chair in the middle of this living room floor, and I was babysitting this little boy. And he was like jumping up and down on the couch and stuff, and I think there was a coffee table over in front of the couch, like in our living room. And, like I said, it had a tile floor and it was kind of semi-dark, but there was light coming in the window and there was light coming from the stairwell. And this boy -- he'd come over to me and he would lean on my leg and, well, how do I say it? He would get himself hot from that. And then he would go back to jumping up and down on the couch, and I think he would do it over on the couch too. And in my dream I wasn't really concerned or embarrassed. And then his mother was there, and I was sitting on that chair on his mother's lap, and he was still running around, checking over things and jumping on the couch and coming back and doing the same thing. And that was really all there was to it, and then I woke up. That was crazy!"
"C-112"	"#C-112 (2004-02-23 (18)) First, the first little theme part was that somebody was pregnant and they didn't want their baby, so they somehow transferred it into Mom's body, and I guess she even acted like a mama duck sitting on her eggs. She was sitting there in like her flowing robe singing, ""La La Loo,"" to help the baby grow, and I had to harmonize with her if I wanted to help create the baby. And so I did, and I saw in this particular scene she was on a little chair on the upstairs landing. And then, jumping to the next scene, we were on this boat and it was all dark. It was like a semi-big like private sailboat or something, and it had these tight quarters inside the cabin, and we were going up to the second floor of the cabin for some reason. And something was wrong with the boat, and in order to get it repaired, the man who was out on the boat with us had to go up to the second floor of the cabin, which you just kneel and you couldn't stand up in the second floor of the cabin. And he had to lay down in this bed that he could just barely fit in, meaning because it was so tight and so low. And there were these bright lights that they had to turn on inside this little bed cubicle, right on the man. And this lady had to ask him questions about what was wrong with the boat under these bright lights and then she could finally fix it. But while this was going on we heard a big boom down in the lower part of the boat, and we were like, ""Oh, my gosh, we have to get off."" And I was wondering if I could out of the upper floor of the cabin because it was so tight, and somehow I managed to get onto the deck. And then I woke up and I was having little dreams about us being in the kitchen listening to Bryan _______."
"C-113"	"#C-113 (2004-02-24 (18)) Have you noticed how when I record with this unit in here, it sounds a certain way, but when I go into my studio, the walls, there's less stuff to absorb the sound and so the acoustics are different in there. And in the last entry I used my Mom's boombox because this one was downstairs because I was using it for my Spanish lab stuff. And so it was just different, and I just think it's so cool, the way you can tell immediately, if you know your units, which one you used and where you were when you did it. It's obvious I'm using my Mom's boombox again because my hand-held one's down by the CC TV and I was using it for Spanish. Last night I was dreaming that I had to take all my equipment up to Jackson, not just my mixer and my CD recorder, but my receiver and a DVD player and everything. It was like I was going to be really weighed down. And I think it was because somebody wanted me to do a gig when I got up there or something. And so I was setting things up in the living room on a little table as kind of a test run, and I had the mixer and I had a VCR that I had to connect to it, and I also had my CD recorder, and I also had, I think, a DVD player. And I was trying to figure out how in the heck was I going to connect all three of these things when I already had two sets of RCA inputs, and I could use adaptors for the other one. And I think either my cables weren't long enough or something, but I had to do a little switching around. And then I was nailing down and explaining to Dad what the significance of having a, like a surround sound system is with DVD's and stuff, and then I woke up. That was a very obviously literal dream because we're going to be going here shortly."
"C-114"	"#C-114 (2004-02-25 (18)) Samantha and Derek were in town and Sandra and Lee were going to be coming real soon. I think me and Samantha were going to go to the beach or something, and I was trying to record something and Samantha was kind of messing it all up on purpose as a joke, and not only messing it all up, but making it obvious to everybody else what I was doing. And Derek was just kind of sitting there like, ""bleah."" I think we were in the bedroom. Oh no, Samantha and another girl and me and probably Derek were up in the bedroom up here, and we had the twin beds, like we had in the old days. I had the notion that Dad was picking up Sandra and Lee from the airport. He called home from the cell phone to say that he was coming soon, but our land line rang with the same ring tone that our cell phone rings with, and that was really weird because I was all confused. What else? Oh, in this dream I had this feeling like even though Samantha played the joke with me, I felt closer to her and Derek than I did to Sandra and Lee. And I think it's because she's so distant and she hardly ever calls or writes or anything. She's kind of like estranging herself from the family somehow because she thinks we're not going to accept her for who she is. And she's having all these problems and she wants to hide them from us because we're going to say, ""We told you so."" So that's why in this dream I got the feeling like I wasn't really as close to them, but on that regard, I kind of feel a little hurt at times because I'm her sister and she can't even talk to me about it because she knows that I'm connected to her father and she thinks I might tell him. She never said any of this, but it's just obvious. And I don't remember anything more."
"C-115"	"#C-115 (2004-02-27 (18)) I had to take the Peavey system to the card party area, the ______ park thing, and we were getting it out of the garage and I was trying to get Mom to hurry up so that she could come and take me over there so that I could set it up before Dad got there. And so we were scrambling around and messing around, trying to get there on time, and I get there and I only have a certain amount of time to set up. And I started setting up the mike with the board and all, and I was, the minute, I just brought the fader up above the bottom, I was getting feedback like crazy and lots of floor noise with it, so I was trying to figure how the heck to fix that. And just about that time, you know, I don't remember, I never started the gig before I woke up. What the heck is wrong with this stupid tape? [tape making noises] I don't know, but that's that."
"C-116"	"#C-116 (2004-02-28 (18)) I was in the Media Center of Westport High School. Now we know the Media Center is the building that is pretty much open air except for the classroom and has a really icky stupid elevator. [laugh] Well, in my dream I was coming out of one of the classrooms of the Media Center and I was racing down the like hallway on the second floor to get to like the stairs or the elevator so I could get down because somebody was waiting to pick me up. And part of the building was under construction, and in my dream it was a lot bigger than it actually was, and I was running down the hall and I came to this little metal gap, like, you know, how you get gaps in concrete, so I kind of stepped over that. And then it was like an obstacle course. There were like rubber mats, little pools and things, screws, there was concrete that was all torn apart and several layers and levels that I was stepping down, instead of just going down the stairs. I came to this area that there's a monument at the Scenic Point, that's like a point in two triangles touching each other, and well, this building under construction had one of those and I was standing underneath it, and I was standing in a puddle of water and I was starting to see lightning. And I thought, ""Oh, my gosh, I'm standing in a thing that's metal and I'm ankle deep in water. I'm really scared here."" I wasn't hearing any thunder; I was just seeing flashes. And so I climbed onto, you know how when you do construction, the windows aren't in and you've got like big gaps, I jumped onto one of the window gaps and I was sitting where the window was supposed to go, yelling for help from one of the construction workers. And I had the feeling that one of them was coming to get me, but instead, Mom showed up with the car. She pulled it right up into a dirt mound, got me, and I woke up before we could go anywhere. And that's that. Well, for one thing, I've been having a lot of stress lately, and it seems to be going away now that things have evened off, but I've just been having tons of emotional roller coaster rides, I guess you could say, because I've been really, really, really happy one minute and either tired or disappointed about something the next. And I guess before things started evening off today, I was feeling like I wasn't sure if I was going to get all my stuff done on time. So that could be where I felt like I was in such a dangerous situation portrayed in the dream. Now the other things are just kind of things that played in there, like the construction is still going on across the street, and fortunately I haven't had to go snooping in there lately. Let's see, I don't think there's any buildings at Westport College that are like the Media Center, but there is an icky elevator in the Language Arts Building that I don't really have the nerve to go on. I never thought I would be like that until Melinda brainwashed me into being afraid of elevators that aren't quite right. And, of course, we know about Mom with the car. She's the knight in shining armor once again because she's going to take me off to a bunch of fun things real soon, and she always comes and gets me out of these things in real life, emotionally more than physically. And that's just that. [laugh]"
"C-117"	"#C-117 (2004-02-29 (18)) I was having a really neat dream last night, one of the best organized, I think, that I've had in a while. Usually when I have dreams about birthday parties and Christmases and opening presents, everything is real vague and kind of distant. That's kind of one of the reasons immediately I know that it's a dream because it is so vague and distant. But this time I had a dream that I was having an early birthday party with Samantha and Sandra and Derek, so that we could celebrate with them before we went to Jackson, we could celebrate up there, then we could celebrate when we get back on the actual day. And for some reason Samantha, Sandra and Derek have been showing up in my dreams a lot lately. And we were in the living room and I was opening some presents. The first, I got some books for my birthday, meaning in my dream, and I can't remember exactly what they all were, but one of them was, it looked and smelled like the copy of A Tale of Two Cities that we got from the library, but it was some other French title by some person. And it was supposed to be one of the most profound things in literature, but I was like, I don't think so. Then I got this other book from Dad that was like a small, about the average size of a paperback, but a little thinner, and it was supposed to be this quarterly journal like type thing about sound and stuff. And it was kind of brown and old looking, and it had yellow print on the cover that said, ""How to Take Amplifier Wattage and Apply It to Speaker Power,"" I think is what it said, something like that. And I'm thinking, ""Okay, do they have to have such a thick volume on such a topic? I mean, not just stuff in general, but specifically that. And I started flipping through it and it was tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny print and there was a subscription card in the back, and I was thinking how it wasn't a really a big deal that it was in tiny print because I have a CC TV. And then I got the biggest present of all. Now in my dream all these presents were wrapped in the same kind of wrapping paper, that kind of like rosish wrapping paper that I used for Mom's TV. This present was so big that it could pass for a piece of equipment, you know, like the average size that the average box comes in that you get? Well, it was that size and I ripped it open, all excited, thinking it was going to be something like that. And it was a box, a gourmet box of chocolate-covered cherries that was just huge. I was feeling kind of a little bit let down, but yet a little excited at the same time because I was kind of expecting something else. [laugh] And then as this dream goes on, it got really cool. The mermaid doll that I have, you know how it just duh duh duh duh. [laugh] I don't know what I'm saying, but you know how that is. Well, I dreamt that I found the little bag that it came in and there were these magnets, like refrigerator magnets, that you had to install, like you had to glue them to the battery compartment door so that either to make them hold the charge longer or to make them do something else. I think it was to make them do something else, but these could have not been magnets. They were either magnets or chips that you had to glue in a certain place on the door, and I was trying to figure how to do this and I didn't know if you were supposed to glue them to the door or the side of the thing. So I was trying to find the instructions to figure that out, and there was this big, thick book that was like newsprint, like the SPC catalog, and it was yellow on the front and it had little pictures in it. And it was all these things that this company makes. It was like an exquisite ______ illusion company, for lack of a better term. But they made imaginative things that you would use in displays and setups that were based on movies, like for ""The Little Mermaid"" they had two or three other models similar to my doll, and they had a whole bunch of other things that were different things, like Arabian figures and stuff. And they had this other mermaid with a purple fin, purple shells and blonde hair, and I was writing down the catalog number because that's another thing that I would want for my birthday. And then I woke up. That was messed up, man. That's all I can say about that."
"C-118"	"#C-118 (2004-03-02 (18)) Mom and I had to get on a plane, not surprisingly, but in the dream we had this flight scheduled for 7:30 in the morning. But you know how Mom is, she diddles and she daddles and she doddles and she doodles, and we didn't get out of the house until 9:30, so we had to take, I mean we had to reschedule to the 10:05 flight. Now in my dream the way it worked is, it would be just like a bus, you catch whichever one you can catch, but you know in life it doesn't work that way. And so we were at the airport getting ready for this flight, and I think we were shopping around in a few of those little stores that they have, and I can't remember a whole lot, but something happened that made us miss that one too. I think we couldn't get on it because our bags were too big, and we had to take one that left at 2:30. And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren't really going to get into town until 7:30 at night, which really we're getting there at like 6:00, or no, we're getting there at 4:45, but we probably won't get to Aunt Christine's house until 6:00. But in my dream we wouldn't even land until 7:30, and I was thinking, ""Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was -- diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn't get out until late. Oh, my gosh."" And that's really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I'm missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my destination, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that's that."

And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and Mom was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That's what me and Melinda used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and Mom was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we're picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I'm telling her, ""Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I don't know when the period's going to end, but I have to take the test."" But she said, ""You have extra time; don't worry."" And I think that was that, and then I woke up. But before any of this, before I went into my test room, I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hall talking to somebody, and she was going to drive up in a fire truck with a whole bunch of costumes. And she was going to whoop the siren really loud so everybody would know she was there with them."

And she was like talking about these intellectual things and all, and on Friday I dreamt that she assigned us a paper to write in Spanish about our life and how it has been unfolding up to this point. And I was thinking that I would be able to do this because I was feeling confident about being able to express myself in Spanish, but I was feeling completely distraught over the fact that I thought I was going to have a week off, but here now I have this paper that I have to do, and that I'm going to have to do it on my trip because I have no other way to do it. And then, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, I was realizing that, hey, this is a dream, I don't even have Spanish class on Fridays and I got my Ethics paper done. And I know there was more to it, but I can't think of it at this time. And then that was it."

And so I went into this, we were riding with Mom, he and I were on a tandem and we rode down to this pizza place and we sat ourselves down at a table and Dad had brought two tuxedos -- one with a straight like scoop neck and one with a flowery, flowery whoo neck. And both of these were like men's clothes that were like way too big for me, but I was supposed to wear one of them for the interview. And the person came for me before I had a chance to put them on, and we did the interview. She asked a couple questions. She asked more questions than I offered information. Usually when I've done interviews with the internship program, I try to offer information like so they don't have to ask everything and drag it out of me. But I let them drag it out of me this time. [laugh] And I had to sign a form, which is like signing a statement in court, but they said I had to assent to the fact that I had a disability and I had to sign a form to do that. And then she asked some more questions, and then I went into another room where I was supposed to fill out an application, and there were these people sitting at these tables and somebody had this long involved math problem, and I took out a pencil out of my bag and I just took a shot at trying to solve it.

But I was in the Media Center at Westport High School, but I was taking a class in one of the rooms like I would take at Westport College.

And class was kind of ending and everybody was just kind of sitting down and shuffling their books and stuff. And the fire alarm went off outside. You know how you don't hear it in the room, but then you hear it outside in the hallway? Well, all of us took our good old time packing up our stuff. Apparently we knew it was just a drill or they were like testing it or something. So we took our good old time -- that's kind of crazy. And so -- oh, I know -- by the time we were ready to walk out the door, everybody had their stuff because we had to like go all together and we had to wait for everybody to pack their stuff.

And dragging my book bag and stuff, and we can't really just go down the stairs because something is blocked or something, so we've got to go down these big ladder things and then walk across these like levels of concrete and then go down more big ladders and stuff.

So I was hopping a van with a lady and a couple of kids and they lived near me apparently and they were going to take me home. This van was a black van, if that makes any difference. And out there it looked like Westport High School. And as I was in the van, somebody said, ""Well, you could take the bus. Your bus is still here. You can take the bus if you want.""

And I was walking through the building and Mom and the teacher were going to take care of some other kind of business, and while we were all sitting in this big auditorium, somebody knocked a purse over of this girl, and spilled all her change on the floor, and so they were going to pick it up and put it back in the purse for her. And this place was very well lit. It had carpet on the floor most places, and it didn't have all those crazy colors on the floor like I remember when I actually went to the building a few years ago. And I was walking around, and there was sound everywhere, but I couldn't actually get close enough to see where it was coming from. I was like in a kitchen when I re-met up with Mom and the teacher, and I had to practice making a sandwich or finding things because that's what I was going to have to do, and this was a little pookie kitchen and it had like practically nothing in, that I was supposed to work in. But before that, when I was trying to work in the pookie kitchen, there was somebody messing with the sound system in like the middle of a foyer thing, setting up like a Peavey system type thing, and I couldn't go check it out because I was confined to the pookie kitchen. And then [laugh] Mom and the teacher showed up again, and we ran into Ms. Fend, and she was saying how some bank screwed her all up for some reason, and we walked along and we went to another kitchen, except this kitchen was full of books. It was full of like kiddie books, and there was another little closet that was dark and probably had some stuff in it, but I didn't go in there. And then all of a sudden we were at the house and the teacher lady was sitting down and relaxing and I was sitting next to her and we were talking about things. And there were these boys that were being real boisterous at the house and they were having this party, and one of them sat down on her lap and was kind of faking a lap dance. And she yelled, ""Hey, Mister, screw you!"" And she threw him off, and she picked me up and walked me into the bedroom, out of that mess. And I think that's that, I woke up."
"C-127"	"#C-127 (2004-04-02 (19)) We took a trip to Jackson, and that this dream, the setting of this dream was like home. And for some -- I don't remember too much, because again I let this go all day. I'm getting bad about that, so I forget most of them now. But Dad and Mom and I were like in a connecting airport, but we were outside on this deck and looking over like a roof into the city. And this thing was like a floating deck dock thing. It was like flying on air and it was like trampoline. We were jumping up and down on a trampoline. And in my dream Dad and I were holding hands and were like trampoline jumping back to the main terminal, which was like about ten foot square on the deck, and Mom was over in a chair by the main terminal. And I was thinking how trampoline jumping might bring back a bunch of scary stuff if we do too many maneuvers, but that wasn't a part really that much of it. And then I was thinking how nothing better happen with this plane because in my dream we were getting home from Jackson on a Sunday and I started class Monday morning, the next day, which fortunately on the way home everything went well on our real trip, and I could pull that off. But in my dream I don't think anything went wrong, and I think we just about made it onto the plane on time because we were waiting for them to call us, and they weren't calling us and weren't calling us, and we figured we'd better check and make sure everything is okay. And so we got on the plane and it was like, just like riding in a car, except we were riding along the interstate, and, you know, how do you slow down, you brake at a red light and you speed up and accelerate. Well, that's how this thing was. It was a vehicle with wings and the windshield was open and the windows were open, and it was like, it wasn't really a plane at all; it was a car. And then I woke up."

And this apartment complex had like apartments that were on like the outside, like on a balcony, they weren't all enclosed in a hallway. And, oh, let's see -- I got to the 7th floor and knocked on their door, and the wrong person answered, and I said, ""Do you where Margaret Henderson's apartment is?"" and in my dream it was 813. And he said, ""No, I don't."" And he was like going to page somebody on his cell phone, but he said, ""This is the 7th floor."" And I was like, ""Oh, that helps."" Then I was like trying to figure out how to get up to the next floor and I couldn't figure it out, and there was all kinds of garbage and stuff around. And I think also that to get somebody, I had to go back home and help me get somebody to help me find it. And I called her and I said I was going to be a little late, and she just, she was so worried about me, and then I, people were just dawdling around the house and I had to call her and tell her I couldn't make it. And that was that."

And she actually opened the door and was singing one of her French songs; she was singing ""Brahms Lullaby"" in French. I knew it and I sang along with her, and next thing I knew, we were at the counter and we like put our heads against each other and sang it like in full voice. And that was kind of incredible, and then there was something else going on. And then I was asking her, ""Your new album, why were some of the tracks recorded in Stockholm, Sweden?"" And she was like, ""Well, it was put together by something in England and France."" And I was like, ""Oh."" And I dreamt that she was supposed to appear at the radio station for a publicity thing to raise money for something. And I don't remember what, but next I knew, I was on the phone with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and we were all going to go on a boat trip and take this puppy that was not house potty trained, and was messing all over the place.

"C-130"	"#C-130 (2004-04-08 (19)) I was planning to go to Iraq with my class of some people from, I think, one of my humanities classes at Westport College, and not really for any serious negotiation, but just as tourists. They were going to show us how it is over there. And one of the main things that was important to know was that each little town square center thing had like this fountain thing with a telescope in the middle of it. And what you had to do when you were going to speak to people in the town square is about two or three feet away -- or maybe four feet -- stand up on this little stool and point an unloaded gun at the telescope thing so that they could see that you had no bullets in it. That was crazy! And so we had one of these little setups in our living room so that I could practice doing it, and I had a feeling like I wanted to get up on a stool thing and speak to those people, but I had no idea what the heck I wanted to say. And I guess this comes from when I hear about it on the news, I have no clue what it actually looks like over there. I can't really imagine. I've never really actually looked at the footage. I guess I should sometime. And in other parts of this dream I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town and we were in the car going somewhere, and we were stopping along the way at this church. And I don't know, there was just kind of stuff in there, and then I woke up."

I actually believed it for the duration of the dream, and it wasn't really all that scary, but then again it kind of was a little bit. And I can't remember anything else that was going on in the dream, but there was a whole bunch of other stuff that wasn't related. But I don't remember any more of it, because, like I said before, I let this go like this is the evening time now, and it stayed with me this whole day. But that's that. It was really, really crazy. Then, as I was waking up, I was thinking how that probably wasn't true, but until I was really awake, I couldn't be absolutely sure."
"C-132"	"#C-132 (2004-04-15 (19)) Up -- you know how in the landing of the stairwell here -- there's a little round table that the old CC TV has been kind of placed on, and I like have been using it from time to time. Well, in my dream, standing on top of the monitor was a big, huge, about 4' tall -- and almost as tall as me -- it was a Santa display figure doll thing, and it was standing on top of the CC TV monitor. And you would activate it and it would just sway. It was supposed to like dance, but when he spread his arms, it was like this big, huge mess, just swaying and swaying and kind of making a noise and flashing some lights and playing a little Christmas song. But I would get nervous about this thing falling off because it would sway so wide, and I didn't really think it was going to fall off, I just thought it might. And that's really all I can remember. I think I was going to take it to a party or something, but I don't remember anything.... Now I remember some more about this dream. It had no connection to the Santa thing, but I dreamt that we were walking from an apartment in N______ Park over to the campus, and it was sort of a nice walk. I mean, we were seeing roses and stuff. But I was living upstairs in kind of a dingy place, and it was kind of small and blah, and so we were on this walk, showing me the way to Modern Media College, and next thing I know, I'm back home at this house messing with that Santa thing again. I don't get it."

And it didn't really have an address because it didn't stay in one place; it could get up and go at any minute. And I was thinking to myself how I would really like to stay at a place that was on land, and I wouldn't want to stay on a ship. And there was another part to this dream. There was a waiter guy who had to come to my room in order to get to either the ship's bathroom or like a kitchen storehouse place, but he came through there a couple times, and he ended up sleeping in my bed. And in my dream I didn't really consciously think he did anything to me, but I kind of asked Mom that, if I needed to get an abortion, would she be able to take me in, not let anybody know. And I don't remember what she said, but next thing I knew, we were on a smaller boat just going for a ride with a bunch of people. And then I woke up."

And I had been there for like three or four hours just doing nothing, and I was going to call home, but for whatever reason, I couldn't really dial the cell phone. It had all this like Spanish instruction stuff on the display and we couldn't really, I don't know, you couldn't really get out. And then I realized that I had to go 1 and 7, 2, 7 and then 8212610, and then I was able to get out of all that messy Spanish stuff, and I can't remember if I actually got to talk to anybody, but then I woke up."
"C-135"	"#C-135 (2004-04-25 (19)) I still have to think about that sometimes! [the year] I can't remember too much about what I was dreaming last night, but I know that, I remember one scene real vividly. I dreamt that I think I might have been at either Aunt Christine's house or at some other strange house. But I had a feeling like it was somebody's house that I had just been to the first time. And I didn't really know the people, and they had like an upper second story, and they had a living room real similar to ours. And then they had a cellar and the stairs are just like ours except they were a lot less steep, they went at a much more gradual grade for a much longer period of distance. And I had to go get something from in their cellar, and, oh no, I think I had to go to the bathroom down there. And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you'd have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn't actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream! And after that thought, I decided I wasn't going to go to the bathroom down there, that I was going to hold it some more. So then I woke up, and I really had to go. [laugh]"
"C-136"	"#C-136 (2004-04-26 (19)) Oh, I smell coffee somewhere! Okay, last night I had kind of a crazy dream. I dreamt that I was in the Bancroft Middle School cafeteria, and people were getting ready to like take a test, like a SCAD or something, and they were all sitting at the table. And over in a corner my Mom was shoveling big plops of poop into a bucket, and I don't know where that came from, but she was saying, ""Getting the dirty stink out of the cafeteria would help them take their tests."" Well, duh! And then I must have been roaming around Westport High School or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for Westport College over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, ""If you don't get your exam by the scheduled time, the door's going to be locked and you won't get to."" And they just say, ""First period, second period, go to your next period exam."" But at Westport College, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing. And that's all I can really remember about this dream."

And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn't making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, ""Oh, man, we don't even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in."" And Mom's like, ""Well, I don't know, we've got people to go do stuff with and we don't know what they're doing and what their plans are"" and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that Mom and Dad had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and Mom kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it wasn't going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, ""What!?"""

And I dreamt that in my Basic Electronics class, when we passed the final exam, we were given a little card that said that you were like a certified basic person, basically. And it was shaped just like my Best Buy gift card and it had the hologram on the front, and the credentials were printed on the back. And it had a little tiny picture of the music major down in the lower left-hand corner of the back, and a little further like in the middle of the card there was a little tiny picture of like a UPC symbol on the bottom right. And I was sitting kind of in a big roly chair looking at something that was kind of a combination of a computer and a CC TV. And I put this card under my tray and I was looking at it, and three boys and two girls all around were like, ""Oh wow, cool, you actually got one of these cards. Oh, my gosh!"" And there was this big dog, but she was real friendly. I had a feeling it was a she; I don't remember what they were calling her, but she was big. Her shoulders came up to my chest.

And there were wires in the middle of the tube that connected them, and in the middle of this, that would come up from the tube vertically like a T, and on top of that I was going to put some kind of a -- like a control unit like type thing, like -- I don't know -- a crazy box. I don't know what it was supposed to do, but I wanted to rig it so that there was like a display that I wanted to rig on the outside of the tube, and I was soldering these wires all together so the thing would work. And I took the control box and I laid it face down on the bed, and I had this little bin of fasteners and I had this soldering iron that was about as heavy as a drill, and it was sort of, it had a wide, round tip that had a little boop in the center, and it had the solder within it instead of on a separate little thing. And what you would do is you would heat it up and you'd tip it upside down on the tip, and you would dab a little bit on and it would melt and you'd stick on whatever you wanted to stick on while it was still liquid. And I had these fasteners that were wires with little round tips at the end, so I was laying them in the thing, laying them in the blob of solder that I put on the terminals, and when I was done with this iron thing, I would like lay it on the bed. And worse yet, I would lay it on a newspaper on the bed. And when I woke up, I thought, ""Oh, my gosh, why the heck would I do something like that?""

And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with like a big roof and like white in the front, and they like made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass.

In this particular stadium there were like where the, down on the field where most of the booths were, then there was a second level where some other -- it was like a thin little circle of fields that was a second level where other displays and booths were that were around. And we went back into a hall because we were looking for the bathroom. We found this audio booth where this girl was mixing, and I thought I used to know her. She reminded me of Abigail, the neighbor down the street, but I didn't know who she was in my dream. She was doing the mixing and stuff, and she was waiting for her next shift to come, and nobody else wanted to take over for her and she was kind of upset that nobody would take over for her. Terri, she asked if Terri would take over for her, and Terri was like, ""Nah, I don't do that kind of stuff."" And I had to cut in between in, I kind of waved my hand like you do in school, and waved it and shouted and cut in between them, and I said, ""I would be happy to take over for you if you teach me how to run your system."" And fortunately -- you know how like a band plays and then there's like a lull when they take a break -- well, fortunately I guess DJ's don't take breaks, but it was sort of a break phase while she was teaching me. This room that the equipment was in kind of put me to mind of the Warrior Vision room, and as much video equipment as they had in the Warrior Vision room, this was all audio equipment. She took me like from one thing to the next and like put my hand on it, and I was able to feel the front panel on each device, and I was able to sort of know what it is. I don't remember the most important thing. They did not have a mixer. [laugh] Shame on them! But had three CD's players. The first and the second one, 10 or 12 knobs across the front that were supposed to be like EQ things, and then they had the usual transport controls underneath the tray. And then they had a third CD player that was like a cream-colored personal CD player. Then they had two other weirdo things that I've never seen before. Oh, and then they had like tons of CD's, but I don't remember a mixer or an amplifier. How in the heck are we supposed to mix without a mixer? But anyway, I remember wishing that I had brought my magnifier so that I could at least try to read some of the titles, because after she left and she said like, ""It's all yours,"" I think Mom and Terri went to do something else. And I was just taking time to look through their collection and see what I could see. And they had tapes of stuff that you listened to that was recorded, books and stuff, and they had CD's that were kind of blah, but the good stuff that she was playing I couldn't find. I wasn't looking in the right place. And I felt like I was doing a terrible mix because I wasn't playing stuff that was appropriate for the crowd because I didn't know what I was going to queue up because I couldn't read the darned things and I didn't, like with my collection I know what's where. Well, this one I just had no clue. And then we were home -- man, I'm using up tape like crazy -- we were at home watching movies, and I think it was ""Brother Bear"" with sort of a crazy spin on it and when the movie ended, I think for some reason the amplifier was in the middle of the foyer with no wires attached to it. But I could still turn the volume down on the front and the volume would still go down and it would still control things. That was crazy! And I was picking up all these lettuce leaves off the couch, and I was putting them into this green container and crying for some reason. And these lettuce leaves had to go back to Blockbuster with the movie, why I do not know. But Dad was like, ""Are you crying like the Toyota?""

Their accompanist was at a grand piano, and the keys weren't out lateral, they were like typewriter keys, all sort of on top of each other. And the guy, all the kids finished performing and the guy was like trying to tune it or something and he had the lid lifted, and there was like fire. There was a different color flame for each note and for different chords the different flames had to sort of mix. [laugh] That was so messed up, man. I don't know where that came from. But then the next scene was that I was at like a beach thing. I think it had something to do with a scholarship convention, and I was swimming with Mom. It started off to be that I was at a boat ramp and Mom and I sort of strayed from the band and people that were there, and we started swimming. And the first weird thing was that there was a boat coming and we didn't want to get run over and so he's like, ""Come on down,"" we've got to get under the water so that this boat can go over us. And so we went under, and I was able to breathe under water because apparently there was like a little air pocket that sort of came down with us, you know how things get. And then when we came up again, I noticed that we were two-thirds of the way across this bridge that was like, I don't know, fifteen or twenty feet long that was supposed to be the skyway, but it was too small to be the skyway. We were swimming to this little island, and Mom wanted to go in this little pet store and get food for the people's dog that we were staying with, but I was swimming naked and I didn't want to get out of the water, so I waited for her. And I started swimming back across the thing by the bridge, and on the other side there was like a turtle, and I touched the turtle, and then he immediately wanted to bite me. And I threw handfuls of sand at him so he would bite the sand and not me and I could get away. But he kept following me, following me, following me, and finally I just forgot about it and I went up on top of this bridge and I forgot all about the fact that I had been swimming naked, and they were like giving out like scholarship awards at this little pavilion. And I knew I was supposed to be one of them and I hoped that Mom would come over from the pet store in time. And I think that was it."

And so we set up so that we could have a reception at the Hilton, and then about a little while later he reminded that it was still set up and that it couldn't be cancelled because I wasn't really starting to get to know him, like he wasn't returning my calls and stuff. And he reminded me that time was running out to get to know him, and I just said, ""Okay, enough of this."" I ___________, but in my dream I did a bunch of crying and then finally I went to them and said, ""Look, I'll give you the money that it takes to cancel the thing, but I want you to cancel it."" And then he was like, ""Well, you were the one that set it up,"" and this and that, and I was thinking, ""No, I didn't. You were the one that made me."" And I think there was something else. I think Mom had found this really small premie baby and picked it up, sort of like you pick up a hurt bird and take it home and take care of it. So she sort of picked it up, it was abandoned, and she brought it home, and then we had a baby in the house, plus all this other stuff going on. And, oh yeah, one other additional part to this dream: I dreamt that I was at some kind of class that was teaching me how to do something technical. I think I was at a thing that was sort of a cross between a CC TV and a computer, and I don't remember what I was doing, but she was trying to get a feel for how much I knew. I was working with this lady, and I was kind of going off and thinking about my own thing, and I wasn't able to do what I was supposed to do.

[laugh] And it kind of shrunk a little more as I looked at it, and it was white -- I don't know -- but even though it was small and babyish, I remember being pleased, really, really, really pleased. And then I woke up."
"C-145"	"#C-145 (2004-05-16 (19)) I was raising and hatching these baby chicks; there were about five or six of them, and I had eggs in an incubator. And I don't remember too much about the incubator part, but it was like this box that I had that I was hatching these eggs. And it was like a f______ project, and I seem to remember the chickies coming out, and there were three yellow ones, a brown one and two black ones. And, you know, they were hopping around doing their thing, and I was thinking, ""Oh, how cute! I can take these to the fair and show them."" And then, I can't remember, something else was going on. Some elderly woman took me to this big, open hall type thing, and there was tons of stuff going on; I can't remember exactly what. But when I came back, I realized that the black chickie had run away, something happened to the brown one, and the three yellow ones had died because I forgot to feed them anything before I left for the big, open hall. I think I had given the brown one away, the black one ran away and the three yellow ones had died. And I'm so disappointed and so heart-broken that here I let these chickies just die because I didn't feed them, I didn't have a chance to feed them or get them any of that baby chick starter stuff before I went to the big, open hall thing. And that's when I woke up. And the funny thing about this dream is that the next day we went to a garden-like place, and there was a frog right by a little map sign thing, and I used to pick up frogs all the time and put them in my pocket. But then a couple years ago I started getting really grossed out when I touched them. But this time I just picked up that frog like I used to do when I was little, and held it in my hand for a few minutes and let it go. And I was appreciating its creature-hood, if you know what I mean. And I was glad that this creature didn't end up like the baby chicks in my dream."
"C-146"	"#C-146 (2004-05-18 (19)) First of all, I remember there was a lot of stuff going on and I only remember about half of it, but that's still a lot; trust me. The first thing I can remember clearly is that I had a math class at Westport College with a lady professor, and she was talking to us about how math is heavenly, but it's a cold heaven and it takes like, it keeps your mind thinking reason and logic and all that stuff. And I'm thinking, ""Yeah, right, lady."" And I had this, you know how in high school they had a book which had like two and a half pages each night? Well, that's kind of how this was, except it was like two facing pages was our assignment. And the first problem kind of read like this, ""John bought five milliliters of ice cream, a cone, a rong (spelled r-o-n-g) and an equal = sign and a summation sign + 9 milliliters. So apparently you had to figure out how many milliliters in a cone and then add up the cone and the five and then figure out what the rong was. And then the rest of the problem was he was buying all this other food, like pizza with chicken on it and burgers with bacon, and you were supposed to know like how much it cost or how many calories it was without any other information. And I had a whole page of these to do and I was just starting to think about the first one. And next thing I knew, we were up in Jackson and Mom and I were like on a vacation, and I had all these problems to do on my vacation. And I think we were at Grammy's house first, downstairs, sort of getting settled and all. And we were waiting for Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry to come over, and Mom wanted to go up the stairs into Grammy's attic to get like her sewing or something that was up there. And so she turned on the light on the stairwell and we went up, and then she turned on the light in that first big main room where everything is, and she started digging around, rooting around, and believe it or not, I was kind of afraid to go too far into that room, but I was afraid to go back down the stairs because she had turned off the light in the stairwell, and it was dark downstairs in the house. So I'm like sitting there, or I'm like standing there on the first step, gripping the wall post molding thing between the stairwell and the room, and focusing on the light in the room, but gripping that molding thing so tight so that I wouldn't fall down the steps. And just waiting for her to just root around and spend all day and do do do do do do. And then I don't remember us going down, but next thing I knew, we were in Aunt Christine's cellar in her game room and the light was on by Bobby's pool table. And the room was much bigger than it really is. And Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and Uncle Burt were in that room talking about making some kind of salad for dinner, and I felt bad that we must have woke up Uncle Burt somehow because, you know, he goes to sleep really early. And I wanted to go up to Uncle Larry and say ""Hi,"" but I didn't want to hang around too much and look dorky because, see, he just got the b___________ in real life, and in my dream I remembered that. And I didn't want to act like I was too anxious to hear it. I wanted to act normal like I was anxious to see him. But I didn't want to be too anxious, you know how that goes. And fortunately it ended on a happy note like that, and then I sort of woke up. Man, I can't tell you what all that's about. But I can say that we've been listening to Bruce Springsteen lately while we've been doing major cleaning projects around the house. Yesterday I ran my sound system instead of having Mom run her Bose machine because hers is in her room kind of facing north, and mine has more power and it's sort of got more force behind it and it can just face right out the open door into my bedroom where we were working. So I blasted it and the whole time I was thinking about Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and how carefree they are up there, and how I wish we could be back up there, no matter how snowy it is still at this time of year. And I think the math has to do with that I know that there are college math classes, and that I can't imagine myself being able to keep my sanity having one. And it was all I could do to get __________, and in this dream I was just sort of visualizing myself not being able to finish my homework and having these terrible test scores and everything I already went through in high school. And maybe it symbolizes like the stuff I'm having to go through now; I don't know."
"C-147"	"#C-147 (2004-05-20 (19)) The story lines of me starting off a new year of school and somebody having a wedding were so closely intertwined, it was kind of hard to make sense of it all. But I think the first scene had to do with me being at Westport College and going to take a more advanced electronics class there. Well, first of all, the most clearest thing in my mind is I was with this guy who kind of acted like Andrew, and he was showing me that if you constructed this little round decorative thing out of metal, and you mount it on a sort of a metal plate, that there's holes in the metal plate that you put, that you attach a chain to. And you attach this chain and then you can chain it. And I think that he sent me to, it was Mom and I and we rode with him in this little golf cart down this path with these little ginger bready houses around it, and that was supposed to be the Westport College campus. And we came to the office of the man that I really wanted to talk to, but before he was there, we had some time to wait, so Mom and I kind of took off and we went to -- I can't remember where we went -- but I think we went to some kind of CD store or something, some place to shop, I think. And now it gets kind of fuzzy from there. But then I remember coloring some cards. They, I can't really explain what was on them, but you know how when I first look at a black and white thing, I can't tell what in the heck it is until I look at little parts of it and put it together? Well, it was like, it was in the ""I don't know what the heck it is"" stage, and I never put it together. I was trying to, but I could never make sense of them. I was just coloring all kinds of crazy colors [laugh] . And what else? [yawn] Then we were in this store and somebody was having a wedding and they were looking at tablecloths and party supplies and pink napkins, and I was thinking, ""Oh cool, if there's some pink napkins left over, I can get them and use them as pink stuffing or something."" And we were looking at white lacy tablecloths and stuff and I think we were enjoying _______, and then sort of I faded into consciousness after that."
"C-148"	"#C-148 (2004-05-22 (19)) Boy, did I have a long dream last night, and I remember it so clearly too. Lately I haven't been remembering quite this clear. I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School helping Mrs. Dougherty with some kind of play that they were doing. And in addition to her, they had another voice teacher, that I think was Ms. Burton. She was taller and a little chunkier, and she was wearing blue and Mrs. Dougherty was wearing black. And apparently the kids liked Ms. Burton better, but I thought she was kind of boring, and the kids liked her better because she was kind of boring. She wasn't as vocally insightful, I guess you would say. She just went through the motions and tried to be a person. And I was helping them in the auditorium with s_______ and stuff, and I can't really remember too good, but I was mostly just standing around. And then we had to take a bus to a portable, and the bus drove us around the campus and drove us up into the portable, and drove us around in the portable until it found a place to park. And then it was just Mrs. Dougherty's class in this portable, and I had written two songs and she wanted me to give them to people to stand up and sing. And the one I had a written was a concept that I would rather be there to experience it, even though there was some stress. And I wasn't given ______ anything basically, and that song was about when I was in her class in high school. And the person couldn't really read my handwriting, so I was having to sing some of the words along with them, just so they could get through it. And then next thing I know Mom and I are walking with her out by like a bus circle. It looked like Bancroft Middle School's bus circle, but it was still at Westport High School, if you could imagine that. And she was talking about like sewing and stuff, and then we got out there and Mom stops. Apparently there was an alarm box out there that had like corrosion and stuff all over it, and Mom stopped and it was like, ""I told them about this. I don't know why they're not doing anything about it."" So she goes to the office and I'm out there with Mrs. Dougherty in the bus circle and I think Dad is there at that time, and I'm asking him, ""Is the alarm going to go off?"" and he won't ask me. So I figure out what that means. And so I run through the parking lot bus area and up onto this grassy medium that's got bushes and stuff so that I'm away from the building, and at that time I realize that I'm totally naked and I'm laying down and I've got a towel. I cover my head with the towel and I'm just laying there, all these bushes and stuff. And then Mom comes back and I call her over, and I tell her I need my clothes. And then I realize that there's a hotel above the school where we've been staying and that's where all my clothes are. And I find the clothes and then Dad shows up, and we're waiting and waiting and waiting, and they make an announcement on the intercom that the alarm might go off without warning. So I'm laying there with a towel over my head and I sort of heard it, but I put my clothes on and then I lay back in that position. And then there's a bench in front of us and they're unpacking all kinds of yogurt and juice and stuff, and they're picnicking out. And I sort of get less uptight because it hadn't gone off yet and it's been quite a while, and then I woke up."
"C-149"	"#C-149 (2004-05-23 (19)) Man, did I have a bizarre dream last night! Well, first of all I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School, kind of at like a summer school camp thing, and the transition students from the Wilcox Center were all there at this camp thing. I don't know why I keep having dreams about being back at Westport High School. I just don't get it! We were like doing a like a tour or some kind of a PE thing, and there was like this courtyard thing that we were all one. And we were like walking around the school and then coming back to the courtyard. The fire alarm system went off while we were out there, and, of course, it wasn't too terrible because we were out in the middle of a big space between a bunch of the buildings and things. And we were already out, so there was no reason to go running in either. I don't remember it was, whether it was just sort of a fluke or what. All the buildings it had shut off in except for the gym. The PE teacher was Ms. Lyons and she was going to take us in that gym no matter what. Yeah, it was still sounding in the gym, but she was going to take us in there anyway. And we were lining up getting ready to go in there. And you know how at Westport High School the Media Center and everything over in that area was like twice as bad as the other buildings. Well, the gym was like that too. And I was getting ready to skip class and run off somewhere, so I would have done anything except going into that gym while that alarm was sounding. And I couldn't believe that the PE person was going to take us in there anyway. But as we were going in there, it just seemed to get quieter and quieter and just sort of not be a thing any more. And it must've just been outside or something like that. And then we were doing our thing, we were playing ball or something, I don't remember. And then one of the girls in the transition program told me that she thought that Dad was having an affair with Charlotte Church because she saw these pictures of them together on the internet. And that all the details about how she was attracted to him because he made her feel so special and how now she wanted to be called Maggie or Gigi, and that Charlotte was just sort of a middle name. And that was such a surprise! And I think there was one other person involved in this, but I can't remember who. And then all of a sudden I was here in my house and I found this CD on the desk that like had some pictures and stuff on it. So I brought it up here and put it in my machine up here and tried to open it up, and it started acting like the Windows operating system, like the usual thing that you get, and to close in the upper right and all like that. And when I finally got to open the main part, it was like some kind of game thing. It was all these different pictures, and I was trying to copy and paste that one picture of him with Charlotte Church onto like a blank document, and I couldn't because it was in this game thing. And I was trying to open up the list of jpegs to that I could just grab that one, and I woke up before I could get there."
"C-150"	"#C-150 (2004-06-01 (19)) It started off and we were going somewhere, we weren't exactly sure where. And I think I was back at school again. Why the heck do I keep having all these dreams about being back at school? I don't remember too much right now, but let's hold off and maybe sometime later in the day I will. Now I remember some. I think it was about somebody saying something about being totally irresponsible. I can't remember what the situation was, but I think it -- oh, I know what it was. Something about putting so much food at the top of the refrigerator and it blocks the light at the bottom on Uncle Charlie's sandwich and then wouldn't we give him enough consideration to at least let the fridge light be on his sandwich. And that was something that Dad was saying. And [laugh] this dream is full of bits and pieces of nonsense. And I think another thing was -- let's see her now -- oh, there was this picture, there was this still picture of one of these American Idols standing on stage. I think it was like a freeze-the-tape shot, if you know what I mean. Somebody was saying something about that it was going to start up a second time this year, but it was going to be a lot sloppier and a lot goofier. And I'm trying to think, there's something else. Something about a machine that wasn't really adjusted right, and you had to do something really weird in order to adjust it. That's about all."
"C-151"	"#C-151 (2004-06-02 (19)) Well, first of all, let me try to explain this. I dreamt that I was staying at this hotel because I was going to a place where I had to be by myself. But it was kind of a weird hotel in that I think the way it worked was you had to exchange your bags at just a certain time, and it was something scary like you had to do a math problem in order to get them back. And I remember being kind of lost, and it was really, really late. It was like after dark, and I was outside, and I was trying to get back to this hotel. And then once I got into the hotel, I didn't know where my room was. It was just kind of all mixed up jumble of mish-mash, I don't remember. But these scenes were totally incongruent. Next thing I knew I was with this girl, and Dad I think, and I had the bird and the bird wasn't just a live bird; he was part live and part mechanical. He had this mechanical thing in him where he would start saying crazy things, and I think there was something about, ""new bells, cockle shells,"" but I don't remember where it came in. I just know that it came in somewhere. I know there was more, and I'm missing half the pieces, but lately I've been really bad about not remembering my dreams that well. Now obviously some of this came from the convention, and yeah, it was a big hotel and yeah, I had to be by myself, but I didn't feel alone at the convention because there were so many other people, period, and people I could feel like were friends, and people that were visually impaired and knowing that they were here for the first time too. And I wanted to learn from them how they were going to function, so I didn't feel alone. But in my dream I felt terribly alone. And the thing about exchanging our bags all over the place, I don't know exactly where that came in, but I do know there was this guy with us that liked ""Mash,"" but I was never scared of losing my bags or scared of something taking them. And I don't know, it was a mish-mash."
"C-152"	"#C-152 (2004-06-04 (19)) These are two dreams that I had while I was staying up at the springs, but I didn't have this tape with me so I couldn't remember them then, so I'm recording them now. The first night I dreamt, I had kind of a screwy dream about a fire truck again. I keep having dreams on and off about fire trucks with the scary back-up alarm sound, and it's got to be kind of a dream symbol and I've got to figure out what it means. But anyway, I dreamt that I was going to help out the fire station with some kind of carnival or something. I don't remember having to deal with the Peavey system, but I was running around like putting tables up and stuff, and I had my cell phone on. The thing of it was, whenever anybody would call me on the cell phone, instead of answering the phone, I had to jump on the, you know, like hold onto the side of one of the trucks and let them drive off on a call with me. And we didn't only go on a call, we just sort of went around the block and came back. That was kind of stupid! But I had like a partner who was going to drive, like a man, like you know how they do. And Dad was there and I had a feeling he was like directing the events. He wasn't really going on any calls, but he was like an active lieutenant for the day. And when we'd jump on the side of the truck, the truck had two vacuum cleaner hose like type things hanging off the back of it dragging in the street. And you know how back-up alarm goes ""Doo doo, doo doo,"" well, the one hose would make the high ""Doo"" sound and the other hose would make the ""doo."" [lower pitch] And [laugh] now that I think about it, it's the funniest thing. It would be going down the road like that. And it would do that sound when we were going forward, and we wouldn't back up, we'd just go forward and it would make that sound. And I know there was something more. Oh, in my dream it kind of scared me and I was dreading, dreading, dreading having to go on that. And so whenever I would get a call on my cell phone, I would think, ""Oh no, oh no, I've got to go do this."" And that was that."
"C-153"	"#C-153 (2004-06-05 (19)) I was babysitting a kid named Joey, and I think it came from a Joey that Mom used to babysit. But this Joey was a toddler, and he had like two other kids running around and they were girls. And they had a keyboard in their room. It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender -- and these were about 4 or 5"" high -- there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change to their particular patch sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don't remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, ""Here comes Latisha; she's ready to see her."" And then ""doot, do, doot, do, do"" and ""Now, here comes the other one. She's a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do,"" or something like that. And I don't remember anything more."
"C-154"	"#C-154 (2004-06-06 (19)) Wasn't really so odd, but was sort of normal, as a matter of fact. I dreamt that my Mom and I were going to go to some park that we don't usually go to, and we were going to take the boom box and we were going to go by ourselves. And we were going to take some Pringles and some root beer and some fun snacks. And we were just going to go there and munch out and relax and just have fun. We were supposed to leave the house at 3:00 so that it would give us an hour and a half to be over there before she has to come home and fix supper. Well, she was dawdling -- and diddling and dawdling, and diddling and dawdling, and we weren't even close to getting out of the house until like 4:30. And I said, ""Listen, we took up all our time. What's the use of us going now?"" And all the stuff was out in the front yard by the bike, and the chips and everything was out there, and the boom box had turned into a small, little dinky, teeny portable unit. And I was bringing it inside, and I came in the front door and Dad was standing right there on the front porch and said, ""Well, hello, Jess!"" I just sort of put it down in a corner and was really embarrassed. And this is the craziest part: there was like a bench in our front yard that was blue and it had like, you know, the plastic diamond things that, you know, benches have. And I was getting really, really hot and bothered on that bench about something, and I bent over the back of it and I had the notion that somebody saw me. And I'm trying to think what else happened. Oh, then we were inside again, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, and we were giving Dad a Father's Day present, but there was a wedding card that I made that was just of a couple, a bride and a groom, but when you opened up the card, it said something really gross inside -- I don't remember what. But Samantha gave that card to Dad and I snatched it away from him because I said, ""That's not a Father's Day card; that's supposed to be for somebody else and that's for something else."" And then I think I woke up."
"C-155"	"#C-155 (2004-06-10 (19)) I was going in a van with some other people we knew and Mom to this ranch, and this ranch had horses on it. And there was this lady named Greta that was kind of acting like Aunt Christine. Come to think of it, I think Aunt Christine was with us and this lady she ______ Greta, and a kid named Travis, and some guy and Mom and I. And this ranch was, first of all, in this van the seatbelt was really, really hard to snap together, and it was sort of a big and roomy van, but it was sort of like a, not really that nice to ride in. And this ranch had horses, and I had the notion that they had lots of stuff they were going to do there, but they were not going to let me stay there by myself because somebody licensed has to be with the horses at all times. And you had to be a licensed driver to be able to take care of these horses. And that was kind of weird, but I felt sort of inferior because I'm not a licensed driver, but what does being a licensed driver have to do with being able to take care of them? And they were, they just seemed like kind of prissy people that didn't belong in the country, if you know what I mean. And I think this deals with deeper issues in that riding a horse isn't necessarily like driving, but people like to box people in, and I think I've been feeling some of the red tape that I'm having to cut through in life and that's what this dream is all about."

And I was supposed to give a speech to this group of people at a banquet, and I was already late, and I was going with a black boy, two white boys and another girl, I think. And we were, they sort of thought they knew way to our rooms, and I think one or two of them had white canes. And they just sort of were showing me the way to get to there, and they were, ""Maybe it's this one,"" open the door and it's dark, ""No, not in there."" ""Maybe it's this one. All these doors are locked."" And we went up an escalator and we climbed up a couple stairs and through a little gift shop thing and we were kind of in the wrong place. We weren't supposed to go up that way. And then we went down an escalator that was really, really, really, really tall and sort of had turns like regular stairs do and little landings. And I grabbed the railing and we just sailed down that escalator. It went so fast. And then we ran back to the desk because then we were really late. And the desk person, I think I said, ""We're trying to find a big convention room. Where is the banquet going to be for them?"" And they said, ""Oh, that's in Building 16B."" And the thought sunk in that this hotel has sixteen buildings and this was only Building #1, and I was thinking how it sure would be nice of them to get us a carry guy to get a golf cart and take us right to the place we need to be.

I was making a dinosaur cookie and I was frosting it with bright green frosting, and I was putting some brown on the dinosaur's feet and kind of swirling a little brown up near his back and even his really beady eyes. And I guess he looked pretty mean because Dad was standing there and saying, ""Now what kind of impression do you think this is going to give people? People are going to think that you have an attraction to violence, and you may be a suspect of something, and you may be arrested, and you may lose everything in a moment.""

She was laying like against the wall with her back to me, facing my desk and all my CD cases and stuff, and I was covering her up so that she wouldn't be cold in the night, because it was the dead heat of summer and we had the air conditioner on. And she was just snoring away, in the loud way she usually snored. And I think Mom and I were singing to her or something. But I thought it was kind of odd, I guess, in that thinking about how their family up there is so much different from this family here. Tonight, last night I had a dream that Mom and I were going to see Bryan Adams at a small place like a restaurant, and it was sort of an intimate concert thing. And we were going there on the bike, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were supposed to meet us because we had a bunch of tickets. And we were already starting to get there late, and we were like walking the tandem bike across 22nd Avenue, and I was telling her, ""The least you can do is get me to a concert on time, you know."" And then we got back on and rode the rest of the way, and we went in the concert and it was just about starting, and they started with, ""Everything I Do I Do For You."" By the time we got in, they were doing a bunch of songs I didn't even know, and I was thinking how this concert was going to be recorded, so I tapped the level down nine or ten notches on the mini disc recorder so with all the booming and banging it wouldn't make it clip over. And Mom went outside and called the people on the cell phone to tell them that 16th Street was closed, 5th Street was closed, and 2nd Street was closed because they were doing some massive construction. And at the concert they were like, the band was sitting up there with a blue background, and for, I saw for whatever reason, I was doing like some really sick stuff in front of everybody and trying not to make it obvious. But it was such a habit. And I don't remember too much more. Oh, I know, the concert and all the sound and stuff evolved into just something in our bedroom that was playing on a little boom box, and then I woke up."

I dreamt that, first of all, I was trying to access the State University website over the internet, and it was apparently by taking some courses from State University because I was trying to figure out what some course material was and what kind of books I was going to need or something, or what the teacher was going to be doing the next thing, or something like that. And I was having a s_____ read different prompts and things, just, you know, like in zoom text except it wasn't really magnified all over the place. I had a real simple screen that I was working from, and the synthesizer was reading a lot of the stuff. And I had to adjust the rate so that it would read slower, and I couldn't, and then I sort of figured out how. And I think Mom was working with me on this one, and she was telling me that you could access the whole thing from a cell phone, and I didn't believe it. It was too whacked out. But then, the next little scene is the part that I remember the best. I was at this ba____ like place, it was like a trailer area but it sort of had more of a farm to it. There were vehicles and things around and there were cages of, most of the cages were empty, but there was this one cage that was sort of covered in the front that had big bars and they were wide apart. And they had geese in it, there were about seven or eight geese in a cage about the size of the chicken cage, and they were all jammed in there. And most of them were grown. But there was this one black goose that was real, real thin and light compared to the others, and I had a feeling that she wasn't really eating. She sort of quacked like a female duck, but she had a long neck and a big body like a goose. And she ducked her head and was able to scoot through the bars of the cage, and I put her down on the ground and she was following me up the road to this house. And she kind of got tired and I picked her up and carried her. And she just had a real sorry sound to her, and I had the feeling she hadn't been eating very well. And I told the lady who runs this place, I showed her this black goose and I said, ""I don't think she's been eating that well. Look at her. And the lady grabbed her from my arms and said to the bird, ""What do you think you're doing?"" basically yelling at the bird for getting out of the cage. And I said, I snatched her back and I said, ""That's not the point. What I'm trying to get you to understand, Lady, is that she hasn't been eating very well. You have to give her something."" And just about that time the bird left a big plop of poop running down my leg, and then I woke up."
"C-160"	"#C-160 (2004-06-21 (19)) I was back at Westport High School again, except this time I was with Astrid and Darlene, and I was there like a couple hours after school had left out for some odd reason. And I was there with my mobility instructor, Mr. Heffler, and they were doing some construction on the stairs and in order to actually get down the stairs, they had the stairwell part blocked off, and they had some like loose boards. You had to undo one of the loose boards and climb down a little step ladder makeshift thing to actually get down to the lower level. And the elevator was, it kind of worked sometimes and it didn't work other times, and we didn't want to take a risk. And I think me and Darlene were on the elevator one time, and the building had like five or six floors for some odd reason, and for whatever reason the elevator wouldn't stop at whatever floor we wanted. And I think this dream was a big hodgepodge mish-mash of all different stuff, and I think after I got my business done, I was like wandering around in this school building that was Westport High School, and it was all in shambles, and it was supposedly that way because they were doing construction. And I mentioned about the stairwell being blocked off and there was just stuff laying around all over everywhere. And it was real precarious. And Darlene and I had a cab to catch. I don't know what business we had to do over at the school, but after we finished our business we had a cab to catch at 4:30, I think. And it was real gray and rainy outside and we were making our way back to the cab circle because that's where the cab was going to pick us up. And I don't remember if I ever made it or not. I don't remember too much. This was kind of a dumb dream."

And we were all going to pile into our car and go somewhere. And we were waiting and waiting for some people to get some stuff ready. I think Mom and somebody else were still getting ready, and Dad was standing at the door like, ""Okay, I'm ready whenever you are."" And I was sitting on the porch swing, and Derek gets out of the car and comes up to the porch and comes in the door and closes it. And this is just unfolding like ______ just I guess so we can look at it, but I think he's like cocking a gun or something, and then he went back out the door, and he got a chain saw and I saw he was going to bring it in the house. And he's revving it up and stuff out front there, and I thought he was going to bring it into the house. And so I ran through the house, and for some reason our house was a little bigger. And then different things kept stopping us. I think I might have been riding with Melinda a little bit, but I can't remember if we actually went where we were going. We were planning a wedding for me. Apparently Grandpa had given me some wedding rings and we had to just find me a person to go through the ceremony with just to show him that I got married with his rings, and we weren't actually going to legally do it, I don't think. And I can't remember who it was going to be, but we were getting all this stuff ready. And people were just like dawdling majorly because there were so many things, and I was outside getting some different stuff. And there was a brown and a white baby chick, and I would catch one of them and take it to the side of the house and put it in a cage, and then I'd go up for the other one. And when I was catching these chickies, I was sort of thinking how I've got to bring them in here so they won't run too far and so the truck won't back over them. And there was also a brown and a white grown chicken that I was catching and putting by the side of the house because I didn't want them in the cage so they would peck the babies. And I was sort of devising some kind of little fence to keep them by the side of the house. And then I was doing a bunch of other stuff in the yard, but I can't remember what. And then I was coming in the house and saying, ""Okay, everybody, are you all ready finally?"" And they were saying, ""Well, we're going to come out there to you."" And they were saying something like, ""I'd better go talk to Grandpa because I don't know if he wants you to have his rings or if he wants you to have my rings."" And then I woke up. I know there were more elements to it, but I can't possibly remember them all. I think there was some kind of orange blower thing involved somewhere, but I can't remember what."
"C-162"	"#C-162 (2004-07-05 (19)) It was close to my birthday and we were having some kind of garage sale or something, and there was like three or four keyboards out on the front sidewalk. One was kind of small and the other three were really big, and somebody was saying I should try them out and see what the sound sounded like, see how real they sounded. And I don't think Mom or Dad were there. I think this was like a big, it was either a garage sale or a party; I couldn't figure out which. But they were inside, busy as anything, and there were people everywhere. And so I put the smallest one on a little table out front, and there was a whole bunch of chaos and confusion, so I had to really listen and tell if it sounded normal or not. And it didn't really. It was kind of funny and kind of weird. And then, so I put it back on the sidewalk where it was with the others, and a bunch of other boxes of clothes and toys and things. And I went inside and Mom was making me a birthday cake that was supposed to look like that, either that or a mixer; I couldn't figure out which. But she started frosting it with chocolate frosting, and dabbing some white here and there. And next thing I know, the very front of the cake was crumbling off, and I could see that inside it was a yellow cake. And then some more of the sides crumbled off, and this cake was just getting smaller and smaller and messier and messier. And I don't remember too much about that little scene. But the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were out of town and the house was totally empty, and I was having Analisa and one of her friends over. Now Analisa is a Jehovah's Witness that's been coming around and, you know, sort of preaching once a week. And I was going to serve them Cheerios and something else, Cheerios and tea, I think, for lunch. And I had a little gold card from them that said something other than ""Happy Birthday,"" but I sort of knew it was for my birthday. And I didn't want to tell them too much about what I did for my birthday because they don't celebrate birthdays and they would frown upon it. But I served them Cheerios, and they said that, they called them rings of cereal. One of the girls said that she did like rings of cereal, but without any fat or any sugar or anything in them. And I can't remember, but they just sat there kind of prissy, and I think I woke up."
"C-163"	"#C-163 (2004-07-11 (19)) I was at some man's house, I think it was for some kind of a reception thing. And I don't even remember what we were supposed to talk about, but I was helping him set up a sound system and stuff. And we were in his like porch veranda thing, and he had this trellis-like type thing that had shelves and plants and stuff. And we were rigging up all these wires to go around it, and I stuck a lavaliere mikeup there and ran the wire around and dropped another _____ down from something. And I think we might have even set up some Christmas lights. And I don't remember who he was or why I was there, or what else I was setting up, and I just had it a minute ago. I shouldn't have gone to the bathroom before I started recording this. But another little scene thing that was before that, that's really clear in my mind, that I dreamt that Dad found out what a teetsy (?) thing is, which really that was something unreal from back in the day when I was real little, that was like a guitar-shaped, light-up flashlight thing that would play the end of ""Have You Seen Her"" and stuff. It was sort of a synesthetic (?) response to the sound that I heard. Well, fast forward 'til now. I dreamt that Dad thought that it was something that you would have to connect to the phone line in order to use, and that it would make your phone bill go real high if you did anything on it. And some boy had it, I think. And I was pretty upset and a little afraid because I was under the impression that it wasn't real, and here he's talking like it was real. And I tried to tell him it isn't real, but he said, ""Well, I saw somebody that had one, so it is real."" And I was terrified. And then I, in my dream I went downstairs after being, I don't know, up here, and Mom and Dad were watching TV and I kissed Mom good night and I whispered in her ear that she should come up when she can. And I think in my dream we stood around talking, but I don't remember what about. Then I woke up."
"C-164"	"#C-164 (2004-07-15 (19)) I was going to stay over at Astrid's friend's house. There was Astrid and there was another girl that was like Astrid. And first of all, before any of that, I dreamt that I was making kind of a sculpture out of something I broke, and I was using really strong glue. And I put like a dinosaur head on the front of like a porcelain rock, and then I put a little tail on the side of it. I put a couple other things on it, and then this was going to sit on a bicycle. And I think it was really raining and really lightning and thundering and I couldn't really go with the girls to their house until it was done. But they were sitting on the porch swing with me, and Mom came home from a shopping trip and she was unloading groceries in the kitchen. And she was complaining about how the store wouldn't cash her out and she had to wait and wait because if the power goes out at the store, then they can't use their register. What else? I think somehow we got over to the girl's house and Astrid and the girl were going to build something. They had like shop tools out and like saws and sanders and vacuum cleaners. And I think in my dream Astrid had a little bit of vision, about like mine, and the girl had a little bit more than I do. And I was peeking in the dark in the bedroom for a hair clip to tie up my hair and then I woke up."
"C-165"	"#C-165 (2004-07-17 (19)) Obviously it's a rainy day. Last night I had kind of a strange dream before huge claps of thunder woke me up, and I must've been hearing rain in my dream because it played into my dream in a funny way. I dreamt that our house was just a little bigger than it is, and our living room was huge and kind of intersected with our porch in a way. There wasn't that wall there. And Mom was sleeping out in the living room with some big pillows and Dad was like, ""Are you sleeping out here because the roof's leaking in the bedroom?"" And Mom was like, ""No, I'm just sleeping out here because there's such a nice breeze, so I really appreciate it."" And then we found out that the roof was leaking in the bedroom and he got so mad that she wouldn't tell him. But instead of roof in my dream, they were talking about the fact that the door was leaking. I don't know why. And let's see; what else? Then after that I was walking around the house getting some stuff out of the kitchen and stuff, and this naked man with a guide dog was going through the house. And I had never seen him before. And I got the impression like he was staying with us or something. And his dog was black, and his shoulders came up to my chest, like a little bigger than they usually are, and was like sniffing me. And the guy was saying, ""Come on. Come on."" And he just kept walking through our house for some reason. And I was supposed to go down in the cellar to get our party mix that I was going to take to the party today, but they only had this little tiny, little bitty light bulb up in the ceiling of the cellar and it wasn't making much light at all and it was real dark outside. And I told Mom, ""I'm not going to go down there unless you change the bulb and make it its full brightness."" And I don't think I ever did get down there to get my cereal, I don't know, but I was real glad that all of this was a dream."
"C-166"	"#C-166 (2004-07-18 (19)) For some reason I was feeling a little bit sick and weak, and Dad was wondering if I wanted to go to the beach, or go out in the tub outside. And I told him that I didn't. I think I felt like I had a fever or something and I just wanted to lay around and do nothing. And I don't remember too much more about that. But then in the next little vignette I felt okay and we were out at the beach, and I was walking in this water and Dad said there were a ton of little sharks around. But I wasn't really afraid of them because I knew they were just going to swim around and not bite us. They were like the size of kids' toys. But then when I was sitting on the beach when he was out swimming, there was a stingray laying up on the shore, and the stingray stung me right in the palm of my hand, and it wasn't really all that painful, surprisingly enough, but the stingray wasn't soft like they usually are; it was hard and rubbery like a toy. And I knew there were more in the sand because I could kind of feel them, and this was gross, but there was one -- I guess I was swimming naked -- there was one that was about to sting me in the butt, and I like shuffled it away. And then I was like, ""Well, what am I supposed to do? I got stung by a stingray."" And he said, ""Now let's dive in the water."" And I was afraid to go across that sand that led, you know, like there's loose sand then there's packed sand and then there's water? In the packed sand stingrays were popping up all over everywhere. But when I did get in the water, we swam and we swam out to this bridge that was in the middle of the ocean, and I hung onto the side of the bridge because I couldn't touch. And Dad pulled a knife out of the bottom of the ocean and said that it was an artifact because it was used during the Civil Rights Movement back in the '60s to cut niggers' heads off. And Dad actually said that, and he'd never said anything like that in real life. Now I couldn't understand where in the world that came from. And so I was there on the bridge and he went out for another swim, and he buried the knife back in the sand. And there was this woman that came out on the bridge and gave me a little brochure about herself, like she was some kind of a sea marine biologist or something. And then I woke up."

And all the cars were moved out and kind of parked on the street. And they had tables set up and we were eating lasagna out there. And there was stuff out like she was having some kind of a garage sale, but we were eating and socializing like we were having a party. And then she said that she wanted Mom and I to come with her down to her cellar to help her clean stuff out because she had a bunch of stuff down there that she wanted to have either moved or gotten rid of, I can't remember what. So Mom and I came in the house and went down with her, and then she went back out to the party and Mom went back out and left me down there by myself, which I wasn't scared or anything because her cellar is more like a room to me now than a cellar. And I thought I would never do this, but we slept in her cellar and I went down there a couple times without turning any lights on and it was okay because I just thought of it as a room in her house and I was going into a room where I could sleep. And I'm okay in open dark rooms, you know. And so, but anyway, in my dream there were lights on and stuff and it was okay, but there was concrete on the floor like a cellar. And I was going through clothes and baby toys and junk and stuff, and trying to put things in piles. And then I had a feeling like there was some, I didn't know why, but I had to get behind this rack of clothes and in behind this curtain. And I was fighting and fussing and fighting my way back there, and I finally got back there and there was like a little alcove with like a little stage and a big, huge keyboard back there. And I was thinking about how everybody was outside, and Mom was outside doing something with everybody. And so I was looking at it and studying it, and I was studying the control panel up at the top, and I saw that where there was like a power switch and display with m______ meters and a bunch of other stuff I didn't understand. And there was a volume knob at the far left, and I put it down like about it, and it felt big and kind of bulky like the ones on the stove are. And so I put it kind of down real low and then I turned the thing on, and this voice said, ""Please do not change any settings."" And it started playing like a demo song, but sounded like some kind of Rod Stewart theme or something like that. And I had the volume down as far as it would go and it was still like filling the room with sound, but I wasn't getting uncomfortable or anything; I was more like, ""Oh gosh, what did I do?"" [laugh] And then, before I knew it, I was kind of somewhere else doing something, and it was like there was a big -- what should I call it? -- it filled the cellar with sound and it was reverberating and everything. And next thing I knew, Bobby was down there with it and he moved it out of that place behind the curtain and put it out in the front of the room in the cellar, and he changed it to like a organ patch (?) and was playing a minor Halloween theme and doing scary laughs and jokes and stuff, as though we had an audience. And then I woke up."

And there was this chicken that I was holding. I was over by the chicken cage sitting in the dirt where the truck usually parks, and I was holding this chicken that was a darker brown than a Rhode Island Red, like almost black. And I had a feeling like that chicken had been either abused or terrorized in another yard at another place, either by a dog or by a person. And I was petting this chicken, trying to calm her down, and she did calm down. And I was like talking to her and singing to her, and I was going to teach her how to be a petting zoo chicken for these kids. [laugh] And, you know, that was the whole point.

There was one other person driving that I didn't know, and Mom had me ride in Melinda's Mustang with her and two other people. And so we started out and she was driving and she had this teensy little unit in the front of her car, and, you know, she used to have, or in real life she probably still does have this booming sound system. So I don't know what was up with that dinky little, actually it was like a dinky little portable boom box that she just put in the front of her car. And we got to someplace to eat, and we stopped and we kind of diddled around; we didn't really eat. And then we kept going and we got to like an outside part of the park where we were going to just stop for a while and collect our sits, because we started out at 6:00 or so and it was late at night now. I can't remember if it was early in the morning or late at night, but we stopped there to kind of collect our wits. And we were all kind of assembling together and I, Mom gave me my mini disc recorder out of her bag, and she wanted me to put it on my person so that I would have it if I needed it. But I reminded her that to go into the park, we'd have to go through a metal detector and they might find it and they might think it was really weird. And she said, ""You're going to have to get used to this, blah, blah, blah,"" so I put it in my pocket and it had this long RCA to 1/8"" (?) adaptor on it and I kept trying to shove that in my pocket too, and it kept hanging out, which I don't know why I would need that if I'm not connecting it to my sound system here at home. And I can't remember if I kept it or I gave it back to her, but then, next thing I know, two of the kids from Westport High School are kind of shoving me into this shallow pool of water that only comes up to the middle of my calfs. And we walk around and this thing's got like a soft bottom like Oceanside pool, but I wanted to get out real fast because I heard there were prickly things and grates and other things in it. And, you know, the whole point of the dream was that we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled the day away, and we never got to go on any, go see any stuff in Disneyland. We just diddled. And I even, I rode home with Mom in her car, in our car, but we got home at like real late at night, and I was wanting to say, ""Let's go back; let's go back there and do some stuff on our own.""

And I dreamt that there was sort of a new wave type of thing that the family was getting into, and it seemed like when any of them were together the only thing they could ever discuss and debate was how people should live if they are considered to be true Christians. And they would argue and debate over things, and one of the claims that one of them made was that you're never supposed to eat sheep meat, no matter what, that sheep are like the holiest symbol and you're never supposed to eat them. And it really isn't right to keep them in captivity, but a lot of people do. And I dreamt that there was this one lady that they talked about who would, you really weren't supposed to eat cat meat either, but she would like cut into the leg of her cat and take a little bit of meat off of him, and sew up the cut. Talk about gross! And the animal would live and she wouldn't want the neighbors to know that she was eating the meat of her cat, but she was, and the animal was still alive so it wasn't really obvious. And after all of that, I faded into another little scene that we were at a dock, at a boating ramp dock thing, and Dad was getting training through the Fire Department, along with some other guys, in how to drive these dinky little boats that would go fast one way and then would go really fast the other way in reverse. And I guess they were supposed to be used to look for people and stuff, but this boat was small enough that an adult person could lay down in the bottom of it and they would be touching either end of it with their head and their feet, almost a little bigger than a bathtub. So Mom and Dad were lounging back in the seat of this thing and they were going to start up the motor and start running around, and they got me in between them on board and it was sort of floating away from the dock, and they were going to start up the motor and start running it around and stuff. And I asked, ""Well, was it going to be as loud as the one we used to have?"" And they were like, ""Yeah."" So I sort of jumped out of the boat, which was really easy. All I had to do was just swing my legs over and I was in the water. And I swam back to the dock and I just laid on the dock and just let them drift away. And then I woke up."

And then there was another building, a few feet away from the first building, which had more bleachers on the roof so people could sit up there and still see what was on the stage. And I can't remember who was going to be in concert, but I think it was going to be somebody good. And I think we were milling around and stuff before the show and we were going to get something to eat. And we went into this building underneath the first set of bleachers, and we were looking around and talking to some people, and we were in a buffet thing. And it was like a buffet, but everything was labeled with a price. For example, one little quiche, which was the size of a quarter, was $3.00, and three stuffed mushrooms were $20.00. Even though it was so just like so expensive, we were like just sort of throwing things on our plate and we were going to like run out. And after we were done, after Mom was done filling up a plate for us, she'd like say, ""Come on, Jess, come this way,"" and she like disappeared. And I looked out in the hallway and all around the courtyard place, and I couldn't find her. And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, ""Here, let me help you pull up your stockings."" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, ""No thank you. I can do it myself."" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find Mom. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but Mom and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other.

I was setting up the Peavey system and testing it and stuff the day before the wedding was actually supposed to happen because I wanted to see how the acoustics of the room where and how the layout was going to be and how I was going to run my wires because they wanted my table right in the middle of the room and I would just have wires going all over everywhere if I wasn't careful. And they had this like, this thing that kept evolving, and they kept telling me different information that was evolving. And at first I was packing up the Peavey system to take it home because the wedding wasn't for another day yet, but then and so I had it like underneath a little cover way overhang thing, and it was raining and pouring like crazy outside. And I was calling Dad on the cell phone and I was telling him that the wedding wasn't going to be tomorrow; it was going to be 5:00 today. And so I just needed to just sort of hang out here until then. And then they came out and they told me, ""Whoops! We need you to be here at 1:30, so just hang right where you are because we're going to do the ceremony here at 1:30, and then we're going to go at 6:00 over to the banquet hall, like called Banquet Masters, for the reception. And then they changed it yet again on me and they said, ""You need to be at the banquet hall at 1:30 for the ceremony, and you need to be back here at 6:00 for the reception."" And I'm getting all turned around, and I'm thinking, ""How in the heck am I going to get the Peavey system over to the banquet hall and set up before 1:30, and get it in there without people fussing too much?"" And then I woke up. I think that had something to do with the political convention that I saw on TV last night. I saw Teresa Heinz Kerry speak in that bright red dress, and in my dream Suzanne Cox was wearing the same kind of dress. I don't think there's anything else to it except I'm just thinking about how I'm going to function in this... [end] ."

In my dream Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there and a couple other people, maybe their significant others. And we were at Grammy's house, and except the stairwell wasn't the narrow thing that ours is; it was like, pstttt, I'm getting all screwed up. The stairwell wasn't a narrow thing like it is; it was wide like ours is. And I dreamt that Dad was just going to go and lay out in the back yard and not let anybody do anything for him or anything. And Samantha, Sandra and Derek and Mom and I were sitting upstairs in the upstairs room in Grammy's house and Samantha and Sandra kept asking, ""Why does he keep laying there? Why does he keep laying there?"" And Mom sat us all down and told us all why. And somebody said that he was laying there totally still, and that he looked like he was done. And then we were all emotional and crying and stuff, and saying all that we could have done. And then he stands up and comes in the house, and he has nothing but anger for all of us for even thinking of him in that way, even thinking that we could have done anything, even shedding a tear and having no comp______ of how it was. And then it was like we thought that he wasn't here any more and then he suddenly comes back to life. And then he went back outside and he sort of knelt down and laid down in the grass, and we had a feeling that was it then. And we were sad for a little bit, but we went on. We were all there together kind of doing things around to fix up the house and everything. And it's kind of funny because this house was like a combination of Grammy's house and our house, and the upstairs was like her house, but the downstairs was like our house, and it had our back yard and our stairwell. And the worst thing about this all is we were getting ready to have a party even, to celebrate me going off to Modern Media College, and we were going to invite all kinds of people. And we were supposed to make a party the day after all this was happening. And I had a feeling like I wanted us to celebrate something else besides me going off to school. And then I woke up about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, and I lifted my head, and I said, ""Thank goodness that is only a dream."" But it really didn't feel like a dream while it was going on; it felt so real. And there's not a lot of dreams that are like that. Most of them are too crazy to really feel real."

[laugh] And so we went to Rosa Hickam's and got some eggs that we knew were fertile. Currently they just kind of sold fertile eggs in my dream, and we put them in the nest for her to sit on and there were about six of them. And all this was in a cardboard box in the garage, when really the chicken usually sits on some sheets out by the sink. And one time during my dream I was looking into the box to see what the eggs were doing, and the chicken pecked my face. And that was really it, and then I woke up."
"C-175"	"#C-175 (2004-08-02 (19)) My Creative Writing class was writing a story in Spanish and gave a copy to everybody, and everybody had to make an ending for it. The story was something along the line that there were these two brothers and I think they were friends, and they were like criminals. And they were taking a road trip up to this museum, and I don't think that they were going to steal anything, but they were going to confront somebody. I don't remember anything really about how the story went, but my ending that I was going to add was something like there was a third person that comes out of the woodwork that is the first person's brother and he doesn't know it. And those two were going to conspire to get the person and everything they had, and this guy was going to put butter all over his steering wheel and all over the handle of his gun so that anybody that, any cops that tried to take his car or anything wouldn't be able to keep a hold of the steering wheel. And that was really stupid! That's all I can remember."
"C-176"	"#C-176 (2004-08-03 (19)) I remember some faint bits and pieces of a dream I had last night. There was supposed to be more of the story, but I only remember part of it. Apparently I didn't do something right or something; things weren't going right. And it was back to treating me like a kid. Mom was saying how she's going to start taking some of my stuff away -- not my equipment, but like kid stuff, like my dolls and stuff, like if I was a kid. And I remember hiding a few of my best ones deep within the junk pile of my closet. And then I took a big kind of thick base and I held it above her floor in her room where she had a whole bunch of stuff scattered around, and I said, ""If you keep up this process, I'm going to break this vase in here and you're not going to have a vase and you're going to have a big bunch of glass to clean up."" So after that she sort of abandoned the process and just sort of went back to sorting junk. And that's all I can remember."
"C-177"	"#C-177 (2004-08-06 (19)) I was back at Westport High School and I was going to go to a school play, like the spring musical or something. And I dreamt that I was going to sneak in, and I went in a door upstairs in the auditorium and I was thinking how I would sit on the balcony and watch it from the balcony, but the upstairs was different than the actual auditorium at Westport High School. It was more like a real theater where the balcony wasn't just across the back, but around the side. And I sort of pushed and ooched and scooted my way through some other people to get to the very edge front near the side. And I realized, ""Hey, ""I'm not going to see a darned thing from this position. What in the heck was I thinking?"" So I decided I had to go in the front way anyway or down to the front somehow, and I saw that there were a lot of empty seats near the front of the stage. So I was making my way down there, and then Ms. Judy from the Wilcox Center stopped me and said, ""Come with me; come this way; it'll be a lot less crowded."" And she led me around behind where the stage is and there's an elevator back there. We went down the elevator. And there we were boxed in a maze of hallways that were real colorful on the floors and stuff, like Modern Media College's hallways are, and they had these chandeliers and stuff on the ceiling and these secret little dressing rooms, VIP areas. But an assistant was telling me, ""Well, the school system gets away with this because they say it's being used for the students and their curriculum, and there's so much more square footage to air-condition, so they get more money from the County."" Anyway, we were winding through these hallways and I never did get back to the front of the auditorium to watch the play, but next thing I knew I was coming home and I realized I needed to go back for something. Oh, I know, somebody was going to be picking me up. I think it Mrs. Mauger from Oceanside, and in my dream I couldn't remember her name. And somebody was going to go pick me up and we were going to go see here, and I was going to bring some clothes and stuff that we didn't need any more. And then I woke up. That was crazy, man!"
"C-178"	"#C-178 (2004-08-07 (19)) I can't remember which school I was at, but the hallways looked like Westport High School, and the main office looked like Oceanside Elementary. And I was in the bathroom and I was going to the bathroom and I was going to go out to a parking lot where Mom was going to pick me up. And I was going pee and this guy was like pounding on the door, opening it up and saying, ""Hey, can I see the creek?"" And I slammed the door and I said, ""Get out of here, you bastard!"" And he's like, ""_____ you,"" some kind of comment like, ""You've got to be mean,"" or something like that. And I stood there, yelling, ""Help, help, help!"" But then I realized that instead of wearing myself out in the bathroom I should open the door and run around the bathroom, and I ran over to the main office and I told the lady what was happening. And I sort of had a feeling that he was chasing me, and what the lady did is she sat me down behind the desk so that he wouldn't be able to see that I was in there, and sure enough, he came in and he was looking for me. And the lady said, ""You're in big doo doo."" And he started talking to them, and shortly thereafter Mom came in the office with Jennie, and then I woke up."

Car_____ DVD as a present and not only did it have the concert of her greatest tapes, but it sort of told a little story in the background about her and what she would do before her shows. And so we had that on for a little while and I was outside at the picnic table working on DP or something, and my whole setup and everything was out there. And I was, I had like papers and junk all over the picnic table and all over the ground outside, and then I figured it was getting too mosquito-y, so I would come in and start packing up all the papers and junk. And I was putting them in this huge bin, this plastic thing, and then I came in and somebody wanted to take a walk with us. I don't know if it was Merrilee or who. But that was pretty much all there was to it."

"C-181"	"#C-181 (2004-08-13 (19)) First of all, Dad and somebody else was watching upstairs on Mom's little TV and Mom and Merrilee were watching it downstairs. So I came downstairs with them, and then eventually Dad came downstairs and I was able to go upstairs and go to sleep. It's complicated. I don't' think I understand it really. Now the second one was that, you know, we really have a rheostat under our cabinets on top of our counter to control the level of the lights that are mounted up there. But in addition to that, I dreamt that we had a really big rheostat underneath the counter to control something else that was only supposed to be touched when the power was off. And I was thinking how I understand the relationship between power current and resistance, but I don't exactly know what aspect of it we actually pay for and is measured monthly. Well, in my dream Dad told me that we pay for how much current we use, but I know that reason tells me it's how much power we use, which is a combination of voltage and current. It took me a while before I got that! And he was having me check that little rheostat for the lights up there with a continuity checker that was all metal, and just had little things at the end. And I put it on each little screw of the rheostat and the light lit up full, and I took the thing off and it stayed full for about a minute or two and then it went dim again. That is woo-woo, man!"
"C-182"	"#C-182 (2004-08-14 (19)) I don't know if this is all going to fit, but I'm going to try. Last night I had a very interesting dream, but it kept unfolding and unwinding. It started out that I had done something with the Peavey system in our back yard. Apparently we had been like having a party or something, like a neighborhood association, and I was starting to pack up the Peavey system and I went to put a cushion or something in the garage, and I got some seed and I noticed that in addition to our chicken, we now had like three or four ducks and two geese. And the ducks and geese were white and it was hard to tell them apart, and there were also one or two Muskogee ducks. And I was thinking, ""How cool is that!"" And I got the notion that somebody was moving out. Nobody told me, but I remembered Mom telling me in my dream that somebody had been moving out and gave us their ducks and geese to take care of. And they were really tame, and they were coming up to me and eating. And then I started packing up the Peavey system, and I realized that my power cord had been just severed, just like that, for some reason, and then I was on the front porch and I was calling the Peavey place to see if I could get an extra one. And Mom read me a serial number off of it that I copied down. And the person on the phone was asking me like, ""Well, did you step on it? Did something happen? What happened here?"" And all I could them was there was a bunch of commotion going on at this party and that's all I knew. And so then I went back out in the back yard and I realized that the severed cord wasn't the Peavey power cord, it was one of those extension cords. So then I continued packing up and I noticed that there was a keyboard on a stand next to my Peavey board table, and I had the notion that it was from the people that were moving out and they just kind of left it there. I kind of thought it was that, but I also kind of thought that maybe I had a musician at the party and they left it there. But anyway, I picked it up off the stand and wanted to carry it in the house and it was really heavy and I could barely its weight and mass. And I tried to open the door and I couldn't open the door, and I almost opened the thing. And I put it down and I opened the door, and I picked it up again. And I walked through the house, upstairs, and I slid it under my bed. And I don't remember going back to pack up the rest of the Peavey system, but I heard that later Mom and Dad were going to be going off somewhere for a little while, and I said, ""Yahoo!"" And I took it out again, and I set it on top, and then I realized that somebody had taken like really fancy beads and costume jewelry, like a really long necklace, and strung it like across the front of it. The necklace was just long enough to fit the width of the unit. And there was this _____ set of beads and charms and old b______ and stuff flopping around on its right side, hanging from the chain _______. [laugh] ___________________________. But then I realized that I felt guilty because I thought that the unit might be Oxama's, but then I kept having to remember that it was from those people who were moving out. It felt so weird to me. I said, ""Okay, this is probably not a dream,"" and then I woke up and I was like, ""Yes, it is."" [laugh] That was that."

And then they replaced that one with Krystal, that was a black one, that was only a little bit bigger, and I was feeling guilty because the first two days I had forgotten to feed her. And then in a day or two it turned into a chicken, and it was a chicken and I was feeding a chicken and stuff. And somewhere mixed in to all this I dreamt that my receiver's power switch was going to heck, and at certain indiscriminate times in the middle of the night it would just turn itself out and just blast.

And there were some kids from the neighborhood, big tall kids, dressed up as Ursula and for some reason the spell I remember that wasn't really in the movie was that Ursula had a seashell locket with a voice in it. She could cut somebody's foot and make them sing the song, and then she would draw their voice into the shell. And then here's the strangest part of all: Samantha and Sandra and Derek were like touching me and beating me up in the bathtub, trying to get me to sing a Led Zeppelin song I didn't even know. And Derek had a dog, like a Dalmatian, that would just go nuts every time somebody would enter into the room. Oh, and the person dressed up like Ursula who was trying to put spells on people, in my dream I took a lantern and I whacked and whacked and whacked the person's face with the lantern, thinking that I was going to get all the spell power out of Ursula.

I only knew a few things that I had to do, and so I'm trying to manage this big dog and keep him under control, and get in this bus and this train. And then I switched to another scene suddenly where we were in a hotel room with Mom and Dad and these two strange girls, and it was a really small, like one-bedroom room, like they are. And the carpets were red, and the walls were kind of bleah, yellowy. And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do. And Dad wasn't really playing the game. He was laying down in front of the bed, so whenever we were walking around, we had to step over him. And I was remembering how I was putting my personal stuff under the bed because I didn't want the two strange girls messing it up. And I don't remember too much about what words we were making in the game, but one of the girls like laid near my stomach and sat on my back and like waved a paint brush between my legs, and I was so scared because I couldn't kick; I couldn't get her off of me and I was afraid of what she was going to do to me.

So before I wrote anything more in this diary book, there was a tape that came with the red book of like prayers and stuff, and the tape had like a choir singing and then a background accompaniment and a girl speaking.

Well, Mom's boom box was plugged in, in my room here, and it had LED's on the front, which is something that hers doesn't. And it had LED's on the front and it had ______ meters, and I played the tape and I was adjusting the balance knob, adjusting the mix, even though in reality her boombox doesn't have a balance knob, and man, it got me really excited in an embarrassing way.

You know how theme parks have a big area where you just sit and wait as an entrance, and there's the actual thing inside. Well, that's kind of how this was. And that's really all there was to it."
"C-193"	"#C-193 (2004-09-05 (19)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, but for some reason things kept getting put off and delayed and scaled back and pushed back and bumped back, and nothing really got done. Then we were going to make some fancy egg salad, and we had to put these real sour things in. I sort of had the notion that they were like poison ivy, but they were okay once you cook them. So I was out there cutting these flowers and leaves from these stems that somebody had picked, and I was trying not to let the chickens get them because I knew that they were bad for the chickens. And at this point we had a buff chicken and a dark chicken. But they would jump up on the table and they would lean down and they would snatch a few pecks anyway. I dreamt that we planned to go somewhere, but we never really got there. That was kind of a dud, wasn't it? [laugh]"
"C-194"	"#C-194 (2004-09-06 (19)) We were coming down the Interstate to go somewhere and it was Mom and I, and we were in the truck. And Mom could let go of the steering wheel and lay down in the back of the truck and let the truck ride along the Interstate, and it would just go like it's supposed to. And I was laying near her, and we were in the cab. And then I told her, ""Now watch for the exit, because it can really go quick when we come to the exit."" Well, she wasn't ready at the time and the exit came up, but the truck sort of went down the exit by itself, and she was just all nervous and jumpy because she didn't think the truck had any brakes. But it did. And we went to the parking lot at the store that I was pretty sure she had to stop at. I don't remember too much more about that. But then, all of a sudden, we were in this house that was like an artsy show house, but I had the notion that they were wanting to sell it, but they were holding a benefit dinner there for some kind of charity. And Samantha and Derek were there, and they were having this dance thing, like meters and strobe lights on the porch, and I couldn't really go there yet because we were waiting in line for the dinner thing. And then it kind of quieted down and the porch was like empty and it was daytime, and I was in line and I had my plate finally and I was going to a place at the table to sit down. And one of the ladies asked me a question right when I was taking a bite, and they said, ""Jasmine, spit out your food and look at me before you talk."" One of the old crazy ladies that was giving the thing. She expected me to spit out my food instead of talk with a mouthful. And the thing of it was, somehow I got in the line at this food place ahead of Mom, but I wanted to sit next to her because I got this huge plate and I wanted her to share it with me. I think we could only pay for one plate and we were going to share it. And so I think the lady even said something like, ""You need to sit next to your father because he came to dinner with you."" But my dad wasn't there; it was just my Mom and me. And then the lady decided she's going to get me out of the prissy dinner scene by taking me to see another little like mother-in-law house attached to this place. And she kept _________ this next, oh what should I say, across a little boardwalk and into this little house. And I noticed a porcelain teapot that wasn't fired yet that had all kinds of little beadwork on it, and I like pressed it against my face and smelled it. And when I took it away, my mouth had the beads on it, and I had to hurry up and try to scrape the beads off it so the lady wouldn't see. And then I woke up."
"C-195"	"#C-195 (2004-09-06 (19)) I had another crazy dream last night earlier and when I woke up at 2:00 in the morning, I remembered it. I was dreaming that, for some reason, Dad was showing me bird pictures, jpeg pictures, on the computer of birds in the park. And they had different mp3 files attached to them that would play when you opened them. And one had this awful, ""Doo, do, doo, do, doo, do"" attached to it and I had to remember which one it was because I didn't want to open it and hear that sound. And for some reason that sound would go even if the speakers weren't turned on, and it was just like you couldn't get away from it. And I wasn't really scared in this dream, but it was more of afraid that I would be scared kind of a thing. But I don't know where in the heck that came from except we were moving all the hardware down the hall into the bedroom yesterday, and I was wrapping up the wires and looking down behind the desk and all that, in the dust bunnies and stuff. And it was neat to see and get to do most of the connecting and stuff for myself, and get to practice that a little. But that was that."
"C-196"	"#C-196 (2004-09-10 (19)) I was attending this school put on by DVS, and there were three or four of the counselors that were there. And they each had their own little building, only in this little building there was a boys' bathroom and a girl's bathroom, and then there was the counselor's classroom. And they were giving like seminars all day about different things. And it was pretty hot. And I was walking around there in long pants and shoes and socks and I was walking around with this girl that was supposed to be like a buddy to me, but I couldn't figure out who she was or what she was doing. And so I'm walking around with her and I go back to Carolyn's classroom where I was supposed to be. And then I realized I'm in sandals and I'm walking around in sandals, and before you know it, I'm barefoot and I'm coming back to Carolyn's classroom and I'm kind of self-conscious about going into class barefoot, but it's kind of a thing where I know it's going to be kind of something people are going to notice, but I also had a tape recorder that they gave us for class, and they told everybody about be discriminative when you record because we only had a 90-minute tape and we were listening to lectures and blah, blah, bleah, going on and on and on for like six hours that day. So that was that."
"C-197"	"#C-197 (2004-09-12 (19)) I really can't remember which of these scenes came first, but I'll try to just cover them all somehow. I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, again, and I was at this school campus with them that was sort of an unconventional large, sprawling campus. I couldn't figure out if it was Modern Media College or Westport College or Westport High School, but I think it had elements of a little bit of each, and it was just sort of a school that represented a little bit of each one. And to start off with, I was at this show with them, there was this big tent that was like, that was their cafeteria, and they had long wooden tables and we were going to eat something and watch this show. And they had huge light-up, blow-up things like you see at Halloween and Christmas now of Sesame Street characters and other little animals and things that would sort of float up to the top of the tent, and they would talk and sing and there would be three of them up there dancing around at a time. And they had these high, squeaky, kind of cartoony voices. And I can't remember what the significance of that was, but I think it was starting to rain and the show kind of ended, and I was walking around this campus with like Derek was there. And it was starting to thunder, and I was thinking how I should get into the main building at Westport High School so that I would be out of the rain and thunder, but having a concern that the thunder might set off the fire alarm and it might be a real problem because here in a building and it's pouring down rain, and that happens, you can't run outside obviously and you're just sort of stuck there. But I wasn't too afraid of that, and once that part kind of subsided, Samantha, Sandra and Derek were going to hang out in the big tent some more and I sort of had the notion that there was going to be another show, but it was going to be sort of on the scary side. And so I walked up some outside stairs of a building that had a lake in front of it, and I had keys and I had the notion that I was going into my apartment. And I was standing on the balcony kind of waving bye to them, and then I went in my door. And then -- this is the craziest part of all, and I think this is the last part -- you know that Santa mechanical that we have for Christmas? Well, I think his right hand is in a fist and he has a candle in his left hand and opening he has a baby. Well, in my dream both of his hands were in fists and his left hand had a light and his right had just had a gap for something to go in. And I think Ms. Jameson, my preschool teacher, appeared in all of this somewhere, and she gave me this candy cane, this fake candy cane with a fake Styrofoam present and some holly tied to it to put in the hand of my Santa figure. But she warned me that it came with a scary song that had a lot of ""oo"" words in it, and that I shouldn't open it and use it, that I should give it to somebody who didn't have that problem. [laugh] And how that goes together, I can't even begin to tell you. But I can't remember. I think I gave it to Derek and he told me he wasn't going to open it in front of me, but then I got curious and I opened it, and I put the candy cane in his hand and what it is, is when you put it in his hand and turn the figure on, it makes it play that song instead of a Christmas song. And I think it went something like, ""_______________"" [singing] Now that's a song I would hear the kindergarteners do when I was doing Braille with Ms. Garland back in 4th grade. We were in that little room by the kindergarten pod, and I don't know what made me bring it up now. And I remember thinking about that and not really being scared, but sort of being puzzled as I sort of faded into consciousness. And that was that."
"C-198"	"#C-198 (2004-09-15 (19)) Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Christina and Danny were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stanley, and I think I should say that the significance of Stanley's name is that in Sound & Vision there's a man named Stanley who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like Mom and Dad's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stanley was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere mike on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stanley came in and he said, ""Did you get it?"" He told me, ""I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters."" And he said, ""I even ran the siren; did you get that?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't get that either."" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stanley played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when. And I think the part about the dancing and singing play comes from me thinking a lot about the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas, and how I would love to read a book about everything that went into that show and everything that they did, and how they decided to do just what they did."
"C-199"	"#C-199 (2004-09-17 (19)) Man, where are the days going? Last night I had a really crazy dream that felt so real. The main point of it was that Suzy was going to perform at Disneyland, and she had three free tickets, and she was going to give one to her brother, one to Mom and one to me, if we could go. And it was like I knew that it was Thursday night, and according to my dream, we would be off down the Interstate by this morning. And ironically I saw in The Weekender that Celine Dion was going to be there at the park the same night. In fact, Suzy was going to open for her. And there was all kind of hoopla about there was this lady that was putting a house together that would fit the pampered diva and all that stuff, and then I realized that I really should call Suzy just to make sure the tickets really were free and we didn't have to pay anything because she heard something about, ""Well, if you guys can come up with $45, then you can go,"" or something like that. And so I was trying, it was like real late at night, and I called and I left her a message. And then I was kind of fading into consciousness and realizing that it was a dream. And last night I never did, I mean, the night before I never did get around to recording that one. I dreamt that, first, I was in the kitchen with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and a couple people from my chorus class, and we were all in these black robes and we were going to sing a song in the kitchen. And this teacher lady had a keyboard set up on the counter, and it was plugged into that outlet by the toaster, and she was going to accompany us. And next thing I knew, I was in this music class with this teacher, and the chorus was all singing, and for whatever reason, I had to work on this typing practice program. You know how they give you these typing exercise drill things? Well, I was working on a program like that on a computer that was set up on a rolling cart in the middle of the floor. This room was just huge. And apparently I was doing pretty good with the typing program because the teacher came over and said, ""Okay, I think you're ready for something else now."" And Mom was there, and did something else, I don't remember what. But the teacher was going to sort of put her class on hold and go and try to find a midi (?) program and see if she could make it work. And while she was gone, I noticed that in this sort of trashy box there were several unopened tapes and CD's. There were cards with song words on them, and there were ten tubes of wrapping paper that were just going to be thrown in the garbage. So I was like trying to pile that stuff in my book bag without the other kids seeing, and trying to save it from the garbage, because it was really good stuff. And then I woke up."
"C-200"	"#C-200 (2004-09-23 (19)) The first one I know was very interesting as it started out, but I only remember bits and pieces of it now. But the craziest main thing that I remember was that I had the notion that before I had the ability to scan pictures, I could actually take the vacuum cleaner and not actually vacuum the picture up into the vacuum cleaner, but I could let it just kind of get like sucked up towards the brush and make a really, really funny sound and just hover there for a little bit. [laugh] And I had the notion that somehow I connected the vacuum cleaner to the computer with a USB cable, but somehow the picture would get over there. Oh, my gosh, how crazy. But then the bad part of the dream was that Sandra was in town with her baby -- that wasn't the bad part. And I was going up to our little attic, which is like a third level of our house, to pack some stuff for me to go. And I was packing up the crazy vacuum cleaner and a couple other things, and I laid down on my back and I fell asleep with the light on and the ladder down. Well, in my dream, either Quinn -- which is Sandra's stepdad -- or me shut the light off and closed the ladder thing and was going to try to kill me by leaving me up there. And so in my dream I wake up and I'm in this thing and the ladder is up and the light is off, and I'm like terrified, with a capital T. And I'm yelling and yelling, and finally Sandra comes and then opens the ladder and lets me get down, and I was kind of singing as she was getting me down the ladder, you know, the song from B_____, ""Come and rescue me,"" and I think she carried me as though I was still light enough to be carried. And that's really all I can remember. But I don't know why, I mean, I guess we should say that in that little attic is the only place that I'm really afraid of heights. And I've never really been afraid of heights as a rule, but when I go up that ladder and I'm moving around in there, I just go so slowly and so carefully, even though there's a lot of room because I just don't like looking down that ladder for some reason. And I don't think anybody would suffocate in there because there's plenty of insulation, so I don't know what that was about."
"C-201"	"#C-201 (2004-09-23 (19)) And the second crazy dream I had was about a little while later, after I went pee, and in this dream I don't know how I was there, but I was with Mom and we were kind of at a backstage area of like a beauty contest, and these ladies were coming through all dressed up with their little helper kids. And they were getting presents and leaving them backstage in their areas and going on, filing on through. And they were stopping in this kitchen where we were, and one of our neighbors was there, and I think Mom and I were cooking food. And Aunt Christine had this -- I felt like Aunt Christine was going to come through this beauty line, and she never did. And the next thing was that we were here in my bedroom and it was daylight, Mom pulls out a little portable radio from when the girls were here. It was like theirs. And she turns it on and it's like, she's just talking to it, ""I miss Jackson,"" and stuff like that. [laugh] That was weird. But then we were like walking, and we said, ""Let's walk to the capital,"" and I'm like, ""Okay,"" and so we're 15 minutes around and we cross a little bridge diagonal like across some kind of water and we're in this nature park and area that she tells me is Bestin (?). And there's this man with his bird that got loose and almost runs in front of a car, but I was saying to her, ""If it only takes us 15 minutes to walk to Bestin, then why does it take us 3 hours or nearly 8 hours to drive there?"" That was messed up, man!"
"C-202"	"#C-202 (2004-09-24 (19)) Terri was taking a photography class and she was learning all about different color compositions and stuff like that, and she was showing us a package of pictures that she took. And there were two or three pictures of Celine Dion, there were tons of pictures of flowers, there were one or two pictures or like sunsets and things, and I guess -- I don't know -- but I guess she was going to pay me to scan some of them for her. And I was telling her she didn't have to pay me, but the thing was that, oh, I know -- I asked her, ""How many pictures do you want, and what size?"" And I asked her how many. And she thought I was saying, ""How much are you going to give me?"" But she took quite an amount of time making up her mind which ones she wanted, and she just kept sitting there, thumbing through them and saying, ""Well, maybe this or maybe not, maybe not, maybe not,"" you know, like Mom does. And I got the mail, and this thing came in the mail, this funny envelope thing from Modern Media College and it was real classy. And it was this box. It said, ""2003-2004"" on it, and it was this box that was real pretty and real classy, and you just put things in it, I guess. And that was all there was to it. And I was noticing, as I looked at it, it kind of changed, and I noticed that on the bottom it said, ""Westport Town Center"" instead of ""_____ Park."" And there were little flowers and there was sort of an indention in the middle of it. And then I woke up."
"C-203"	"#C-203 (2004-09-26 (19)) The day that's supposed to be my going away party, but just listen to the wind outside! The hurricane's going to make my party go flop. But anyway, I had a crazy dream last night. I dreamt that I was in my apartment and I was having some visitors over as an apartment-warming party, and it was really an odd type of a place, and as I was walking around through it, I was feeling like, ""This is not what I had in mind. I had a more normal place in mind."" First of all you had to go up three steps and duck to get in the front door. It was almost like climbing in a window. And there was a couch right in front of it, so it was like a window instead of a front door. And then the bedroom had somebody else's stuffed animals in it, and it had kind of a small and bleah bed, and there was like a shelf mini sound system up on top, like in order to touch it, you had to stand on tippy toes on the bed, but you had a remote control that you could sit somewhere and control it with. And it sounded kind of old and kind of bleah, and you would press a certain button the remote control and it would act as a remote controller for the washing machine. And it had a little laundry chute where you would put the clothes, that was white, right next to the black sound array setup. And you'd put the clothes in and then you would use the sound system remote to control what the clothes have to do in the washing machine. How bizarre! How bizarre! And then Mom wanted to take me down to the cellar to see what the washing machine was doing, and I just did not want to go. I was scared to death to go in the cellar, and that's really all I can remember about that dream. And then I woke up because I thought somebody was knocking on my door, but it was the stupid window banging on the awning. The wind was blowing it around. I dreamt that we were at the park and Mom was playing one of my mixed CD's on her boom box, which it really doesn't sound that good, but it did in my dream, and I was sitting in a banyan tree. And then I came down and we were laying on a blanket and somehow Dad found one of my diary books and happened to open it up to kind of an innocuous passage about being in the park and climbing the tree, and he read it out loud, which I let because I knew there was nothing in that passage. And then he turned the page and he came to something about how hard to get along Aunt Joyce is and I made him close the book. And he was suggesting in my dream that he wanted me to scan these pages so that they wouldn't be on paper any more. ""I don't understand,"" he says, ""a person who doesn't think too much technology in somebody's life, gidgets and gadgets, is a good thing."" But he's got this thing against having stuff on paper. [laugh] I don't know what it is, but in my dream he was wanting me to scan those pages in my diary so they wouldn't be on paper any more. And I told him, ""It doesn't do OCR for handwriting. It probably will ______, there'll probably be an update and then I will, but not now. It doesn't do OCR for handwriting."" Well, he didn't care; he wanted me to. So before I woke up, in my dream I was sitting there trying to do the thing, and I was getting a little tangled up and I wasn't sure where I was going and what I was doing. And then I woke up."
"C-204"	"#C-204 (2004-09-28 (19)) I was already at Modern Media College for orientation, and we were in this room that had yellow floors in a lightly lit area and blue floors in a darker area. And in the yellow floor area there were some desks and chairs and line up things like bowling alleys, and over the blue floor area there were various -- actually there was only one in this area -- a little work station area with a mixing board and a bench to sit at in front of it and a bench to sit at a few feet back. And it wasn't really a graded test, but the instructor was going to give us a test that we had to go up to the board, figure it out, connect the wires where they needed to go, make all the mix and let him listen to it and just to see kind of, get to know the equipment kind of like. And R_____ and I were going to be a team. And in my dream she was sort of semi-hefty and wearing blue. And in my dream she said that, ""Always Be My Baby"" was her favorite song. And I can't remember what we were going to play through the board, but I ran my hands all over the board, and I wasn't shy about it, and I remember bringing the masters down before I went to feel the connections in back. And there was this digital bit of cable laying next to it that I had the notion was supposed to be used for a mike input, and it was supposed to work like an XLR, but it wasn't. We had to jam it into one of the places where an XLR went. That was crazy. And so I connected it to the board and to the mike, and it was making this really awful sound. And I realized that the instructor had tied a knot in it just so we would have to discover it and untie the knot. And then it was better. And then after that, I was on the porch swing telling Mom about it, and in my dream I was feeling really confident and ready for anything basically. "
"C-205"	"#C-205 (2004-10-01 (19)) I was at this class with Ophelia in college, and it was more of a linguistics class than a Spanish class because we were given these sheets with pictures and _____ with _________s. And they had pictures and they had sentences that, oh my gosh, were comprised of Spanish words and Italian words and German words and French words all mixed around. There was even some Latin thrown in. And we had to discern the meaning of the sentence based on the familiarity with the Latin bases in each language and look at the picture. Oh yeah, and there were some blanks in the sentence too. And we had to fill in the blanks with Spanish words because that was the only foreign language that we had expressive and receptive skills in. And then we had to write our own sentences, and I don't remember being able to discern too well what the pre-made sentences were. But then I wrote, we wrote some of our own sentences, and one of the sentences was, ""Dwight and his girlfriend had keys to the bathroom because they had to go really bad. Then they got locked in."" [laugh] Now where that came from, I don't know, but I remember I was working on another one of those, and we were at the airport. Mom and I were supposed to go on a plane somewhere, I think, and I was working until like the last minute to finish that thing. You know how I do sometimes. And then I had to, I really did have to go to the bathroom, and, well, come to think of it, I wasn't going anywhere with Mom; I was going with this class. And I had to go to the bathroom, and in this line of bathroom stalls, they had stalls with doors that closed, and they had empty toilets facing sideways in front of the doors. And so I sat on one of the empty toilets in front of the doors, and the door was open, and Dad said, ""Try and move over in here; I've got to go too."" And he went in the stall and closed the door, and here I am sitting on the toilet in front of the door. I guess he Athought it was more politically correct to see a woman going to the bathroom than to see a man going. And as I'm trying to go, somebody in the airport comes out and starts talking to this class about what they're going to do when and what flight they're going to take and what city they're going to stop in and giving them directions. And I noticed that they were all sitting real close to me, and I'm like in the audience. I'm just on a toilet instead. And so I'm standing up and trying to pull up my pants and I feel a little embarrassed. And then I woke up."
"C-206"	"#C-206 (2004-10-04 (19)) I was at this market, kind of like a meat frozen thing, except it was outside. And there was like fake snow on the ground in this one area, and there were these ducks and geese that were alive, and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't see them at first, because I could only just sort of barely make them out because I was not really that close. And then as I got closer, I realized that all the geese, their big bodies, were jammed into these little buckets, meaning their heads and their chest were sticking out, but their tail and their feet and their bottom were just squeezed and, what should I say, twisted and just shoved into these little buckets so that they couldn't get out. All they could do was just sit there and look at people, which I guess the point was they have their heads up to have them looking at people. But man, what a way to do it. And I think a few of the ducks were like that too, but there were a few of them that were free and were running around, and they were mallards. And I caught a mallard that was pretty tame, and I held it for a while and then I let it go back to the market thing. And that was one little scene. And in my dream I didn't feel too bad about it. I wanted to pull them all out and set them free, but I had a feeling like it was against the law to set them free because they were like livestock, I guess. And the next little scene was that Mom and I were in the garage and, you know, we were kind of whispering and stuff. And Dad heard us whispering about how Mom thought he was going to get rid of her, and he came in and said something like, ""Oh, is that what you talk about. Why do you give her that impression?"" or something like that, and, you know, all like that. And then I think Sandra was in town and we were riding bikes or something, and her and Dad were riding on the tandem and Mom and I were walking and we were just lagging way behind. And then I woke up."
"C-207"	"#C-207 (2004-10-07 (19)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town. They were staying in this kind of house that wasn't ours, and it had wood floors and it had a lot of windows, but it was smaller than ours. And the main thing about this dream that I can remember right now was that Derek had this red car that was really new-fangled, and he designed this type of alarm that was to warn people around that a person was having an epileptic seizure, but in order to activate it, the windshield had to be cracked and the two front doors had to be open. And it wasn't a ""whoo whooey"" kind of sound; it was a dark, heavy -- I don't know how to describe it -- kind of lower frequency and a horn kind of an alarm. And it was a few decibels louder than the norm. And I dreamt that he was wanting to demonstrate it to everybody and everybody was wanting to see it, and they sort of told me, ""Oh, it's not going to happen. I'm just going to show you what makes it happen."" But I knew better. I was out on the porch with them, and I opened the door and I ran in the house. And the bedroom was close to where the car was parked, so I ran in the living room, I laid face down on the couch and covered my ears. And I heard it a little bit, but it wasn't bad. Then I went back out and I think there was more to this dream in that these, this scene with the car that he had designed had something else to do with audio also, but I can't remember exactly. And it had to do with this round thing that was part of the engine, and if it got too hot, it was a problem. But I don't remember any more. Oh, and another thing was that Dad took me to this place, this 18 key place, and I took my cell phone to ask a question about something on the bill because the bill was like $96 and usually in reality it's only $26. And I couldn't figure out what in the heck was going on. And I think that was all. Now there's something else I remembered about that dream. I also dreamt that there was a white chicken and another chicken that was white with black speckles, and I realized I had a notion they had been sitting in boxes for days, live chickens just sort of confined in little cardboard boxes about twice their size. And they were light and thin, they seemed way too light for their sizes. And I figured it was high time that we let them run in the yard, and I wanted to keep a close eye on them to see if our other chickens would accept them or if they would go crazy and peck them and shoo them. And I really don't remember what happened, but I remember them walking away from the boxes and doing just fine."
"C-208"	"#C-208 (2004-10-08 (19)) I say that because it makes no sense at all. I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were at town, and we were up at some place like Clementine Springs or some kind of p_____ park or nature preserve or something like that, but I had a feeling it wasn't exactly Clementine Springs, but it was another name like S_______ Springs. And let's see, what happened first? Samantha, Sandra, and Derek and Teresa and Paula and Patricia, and they all went off to do something, and they were splashing and ______ing in the springs and stuff, and shooting down the river, and Mom and Dad and I were sitting at an area that really closely resembled Circle Lake Park. And we were just sitting there, like quiet, and we were just talking about different things. And we were gazing into the water and we saw like these reflections in the water that were like people with instruments. And Mom said, she said, ""I saw an advertisement that was for a keyboard that could make the sound of all the instruments that were ever created, for only something like $50. Now that can't be. It would have to be really kind of cheap."" And Dad was right there, and I think she said, ""I'll show it to you, but you have to do your homework first."" And apparently this was like back when, I don't know, but I had the notion that I had some homework to do. And it was like math, it was this really simple -- oh, before any of this -- now it's coming back to me: I dreamt that I was in a class and these college kids were so dumb, they didn't know their times tables. And this math teacher was trying to drill the times tables into these kids my age. And so, back to the scene that I was talking about, we had multiplication homework that was like really basic, except in some of the problems there wasn't numbers. There were little fish symbols, and I didn't know what to make of them. And then some were normal and some were stupid things like 1 X 12 and 0 X 4 and stupid stuff like that. And also there was one really challenging one though that was 23 X 63. And I was thinking, ""Okay, how do I do this one? I don't the space to write it out, and I don't have a calculator. So, okay, I can do 9 X 23 and then do 7 X 23 and add those two numbers together and that would be the answer to what 63 X 23 is."" And then I woke up."
"C-209"	"#C-209 (2004-10-09 (19)) Mom and I were shopping at this little store in downtown somewhere. We were on a trip somewhere and I don't remember where we were. And I dreamt that we stepped outside and we saw these two like plumes of smoke in the east, and that kind of symbolized something. I think it symbolized Lorna and Reyna and how they kind of stand together, and in my dream, instead of all the way, there was sort of a reddish colored CD called ""This is It"" with, there were two figures on the front, naked. And, of course, that doesn't actually exist, but it was right after talking about love, kind of as a farewell thing for a while. And so I was going to go over and investigate what in the world that was, and it was like a fancy, exclusive hotel with a meeting room thing, and apparently I got the notion that it was through the fundraiser thing for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. And they were doing a thing there, and Mom and I snuck in and how she does sometimes, sent me to the front with somebody else. I climbed over a couple chairs and there were like four empty chairs in the front row and I took one of them. And this lady, this Barbara lady is talking and talking, and showing little movie things about their life and stuff, and then Celine Dion came out to talk to the people, and she was in a wheelchair, like one of those scooter motorized things. And before she addressed the people, apparently they were like taking a break or something, and she came up to the people in the front, and I said, ""I know you've heard this a thousand times, but I'm one of your biggest, most humongous fans."" And she leaned over and the took my one hand in both of hers, and her voice was like real soft and mystery, kind of like _________ is, and I couldn't figure why that was."
"C-210"	"#C-210 (2004-10-20 (19)) We're now in Cedar Park and it's taken this long before I've ever had a dream that I can remember because I have been just going and going and going all through the days, and when I sleep and when I wake up, it's like, ""Bleah...."" There's like nothing that I can remember. But today I can remember one. I dreamt that was going to Modern Media College, over for some kind of an introductory thing, and it was this real informal, casual meeting at this McDonald's cafeteria thing. And they had this yellow awning and stuff, and it was real colorful. And this one guy came over to me, kind of like a teenage student assistant type of thing, and he gave me this paper with some writing scribbled on it. And he said, ""This is a test. You need to pass this test if you want to get in. You need to turn it in, in Orientation tomorrow."" And he gave me two papers. One paper was like writing of questions, and another paper was a worksheet. And this writing was like in pencil. I could barely read it. And in my dream I was out at this open park place and it was almost dusk, and I had this CC TV set up at a picnic table. And I was reading this stuff and the sentences didn't make sense. You had to fill in the blank. One of the sentences that I can remember was, ""The mixer marked ________ before you can walk."" And I wrote, ""Queue up,"" for some reason. And I don't remember what the other things were, but they were just jumbled and they didn't make any sense. And I was real concerned that they weren't making sense to me. And then I woke up."
"C-211"	"#C-211 (2004-10-22 (19)) The first part I can remember the best is that Mom was going to have lunch with Lenny, and I was in Best Buy looking at some stuff, and I had my long book bag and it was dragging it around. And it had all kinds of stuff in it; it was real heavy. And sometimes I wonder if I look suspicious in stores before I have to look so closely and touch so many things. But in this dream a security guard from Best Buy started giving me a hard time and I said, ""Here, do you want to search through this bag? Go ahead."" And he said, ""Yes, I would like to search through this bag."" And he started pulling out all my books, my umbrella, my sweater, and I told him, ""There are some blank CD RW's in the bag, but they've been opened. They don't belong to the store. And there's also a MiniDisc recorder that has my ID on it."" And he's looking and looking through the bag, and then he packs everything back in just like I had it. He seemed satisfied. That was crazy, man. And then, the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were at this circus place with me, and there were these animals that would supposedly harm somebody, but they were so friendly and so gentle, this tiger -- actually there were two tigers and a bear. The next thing I knew, they were in our bed and we were just loving to have them. And Analisa, the little Jehovah's Witness girl, showed up in my dream and she said, she was sitting at the foot of our bed talking with us. And she said how having those animals in that bed was sort of like infidelity. And we were explaining to her that we just needed to give them a home and stuff. That is when I woke up."
"C-212"	"#C-212 (2005-01-29 (19)) The last three nights I've been having pretty dynamic dreams, but I just finished the whole blank tape and I have been reluctant to start another one. And mostly I've been writing them down in my journal, or rather typing them. But I feel like, for some reason or another, I need to go back to speaking on a tape. And I think that is because my writing -- I describe things differently when I write than when I speak. And for journal and for diary that's good because I like my word sense per se, my syntax. I like how I can sit and come up with vivid descriptions of things. But in my dreams some things are very vivid, and I can't describe them in words, and it's easier to describe them verbally than actually writing it down in words. Although sometimes it may be better to write them down in words because I capture more detail that way, like when I wrote about Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I singing on stage and jumping on this trampoline, I just filled that with as many details as I could think of. And I guess I have to try to do that in my ______. And I keep saying one of these days I want to sample all these things and I want to turn them into mp3's and I want to cram tons of them on a single CD so that I don't have all these tapes laying around, and so that I can start using the tapes again to do stuff like this, because every time a thought rips me, I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing or get up in the middle of the night and go turn in my machine and grab a mike and plug it into the mixer and go to c____ and get Pro and doot, do doot, do doot; doot, do doot, do doot. I want to grab my take machine, hit ""record"" and start saying what's on my mind or what I'm thinking before it just totally goes away. So it's better consistent, just voice, it doesn't really matter; it doesn't have that much spectrum to it. So I can use tapes to capture it and then sit around diddling, diddling and diddling and diddling after the fact. [laugh] So here we go. Last night's dream is still the clearest to me because it was the most recent and because it kind of hit my like a ton of bricks in the way. Not that heavy, but it was something that I was thinking about. I dreamt I was back home in Westport and it was like I had been away for a while, like I am, and I was coming home. And they were having a celebration for me, but it was a little pinky celebration. There was like three people there, I think Clark and Marilou and Terri. And they were just talking, there was no real party going on. But somehow Mom was riding the bike and I was sitting on her handlebars in the basket, and she was telling me that she was pregnant, and that she was having a baby. And she said that she didn't want to have to start all over again, but that Dad wanted another child, and he did want to start all over again. And so she had to have this baby because he wanted one. And she said, ""I'm only going to love this baby half as much as I love you."" And I was so sad for her because, first of all, she didn't want to start all over again. This is a time in her life where she's ready to move on and do other things, and apparently it wasn't like the regular pregnancy term. It was this deal where you get pregnant, and four or five days later [laugh] the baby pops out. That was messed up, man. And then we were on -- in the last scene of that dream -- we were on the bed, and I was laying and I was talking to Mom about various things. And she was signaling to me that Dad was on the other side of the bed and not to say anything really outlandish. And I looked over and I saw that he was, but in this dream that was unusual because she was on his side of the bed and he was on her side of the bed. Now his side of the bed is the closest to the short mirror dresser and the stereo receiver in the room, and her bed is closer to the upright dresser and the night stand and the air conditioner thing-a-ma-jiggy. So in my dream they were kind of reversed, and I was just kind of making up small talk. And then I woke up. Now the night before I had a dream that was real, real kind of foggy and bleah and blurry, and literally I was walking around in a blurry world. But the concept and what happened is kind of not clear either. I dreamt that we had come home from some kind of long trip and we needed to do something with Grandpa, and it was dark out. And Dad was in the truck and Mom was in the car, and I was riding with Mom in the car. And Dad was going to go to Home Depot and get one or two things for Grandpa and then go over to his house. And Mom said she was going to go do some grocery shopping and make some copies and this and that and the other, and she said, ""I hope you don't mind me driving around so much."" And Dad was like, ""No, that shows that you love me and you want to take care of things around the house, and for the house. And I was like, ""Wow,"" they would never say anything like that in real life. They've never been gushy over each other. And so Mom and I really were just going gallivanting, just going to do all this stuff together, and we were in this area that had woods. We stopped the car and for some reason we shut off the engine, but the headlights were still on. And she was guiding me through this banyan tree area, I think there were like several banyan trees. And there was this net, and she led me through, you know, tripping through the roots and everything, and there was a butterfly caught in the net, and it was a big butterfly, about the size of my two hands put together, if each hand was a wing. And it looked like a Monarch, and it touched it, and that helped it get out of the net and it flew off. But I felt good that I was actually able to see a butterfly. And that's all I can really remember about that dream. And the third one that was two nights ago or three nights ago, I dreamt that I was at some kind of beach with Mom and Dad and Terri and a bunch of other people, and we were planning this celebration for me for some reason. I think had either graduated or had some kind of successful milestone and we were going to be in a parade, and we were going to be in a school bus in a parade. And we were organizing like the parade route and this and that and the other, and the bus driver had this really thick Spanish accent. And this lady -- I don't know who she was -- I don't know who she was, but she was very outgoing, she sounded like a cross between Terri and Serena, and she was leading everybody and trying to get them to have fun and party on this bus. And you know how buses have intercom systems sometimes to talk to the passengers? Well, she was, her and another cluster of people were yelling into the mike, saying, ""Party, yahoo!"" and stuff like that. And I'm really surprised that there was no feedback, but in this dream that law of physics was suspended, and it was funny because she aimed it at me and I was sitting like four rows back. And she said, ""Jasmine, say something!"" And I don't remember what I said, but I said something and it was amplified as though I was talking into it. And that's all I can remember about that."
"C-213"	"#C-213 (2005-02-01 (19)) Modern Media College was having a seminar at the Eastport Airport about audio related to the travel industry, so to speak, and what goes into like setting up the PA on a plane, and what goes into like wiring one of those airports for sound and stuff. And I just thought that was going to be so interesting, but how I was going to get from here to Eastport Airport was beyond me. And actually in this dream I was back in Westport, and I actually had to do a triangle. I had to get back over to Modern Media College, then over to Eastport Airport. Somehow Mrs. Dougherty was involved, and I wanted Mom to go with me so I wanted her to chaperone this field trip. And, you know, things aren't organized like they used to be in high school, but I thought they were in this dream, and I thought we were going to have a really big bus that was going to just drive us, and Mom could sit on the bus and chaperone the trip, you know. But the only hitch here is that I couldn't find the papers that said what day that was going to be, and it was going to be on a Tuesday and in my dream I didn't know if that was going to be today or next week. And so I was afraid that I missed it. And actually when I was trying to tell Mom and Dad about this, Mom was drawing something, and Dad suggested putting serial numbers on the back of her painting so that if she did two or three of similar, then it would kind of add value to them. And I could tell it went over like a lead balloon with Mom. [laugh] But she said, ""Okay, that's a good idea."" And she was going upstairs to her room to look for the papers, and then I woke up."
"C-214"	"#C-214 (2005-02-06 (19)) I know I had kind of a complicated dream last night, but I can only dream a small little part of it because I went to sleep about 8:00, got up about 1:00, did my lab, went back to sleep about 5:30 and now it's 8:00 and I'm awake again in time for class at 9:00, except I'm a little made at myself because I forgot that I already took my clays and I don't have to be there until 10:30. I could have let myself sleep another hour. Oh well. The part of the dream that I can remember is that I was at some kind of apartment place or hotel that had a pool. I think it was supposed to mimic the place here, but I felt like it was a place that I didn't live at. The pool was an indoor pool with a little like greenhouse cover over it, but in order to turn the heat up in the water, what you had to do was go through a little gate, kneel down and crawl inside of a box that had all kinds of pumps and stuff in it. And you had to lay on your back and up on the roof of this box was a touch screen like the one on the keyboard in class. And what you had to do is you had to press a button and then touch a particular object on the menu, just like you do with that, and then it would come on. I was feeling really claustrophobic and I didn't know if I was going to be able to handle that. And even after I sort of did that, I came out and I looked at the pool, and I was going to go in. But I decided I wouldn't."
"C-215"	"#C-215 (2005-02-08 (19)) I was graduating from Modern Media College already and I had a friend that was graduating from the university close by, and for some reason we had to attend the preppy dinner for the preppy university, and Modern Media College really didn't have a real like distinct cap and gown like uniform things, and they had us wear like regular clothes, which I hear is what they're going to do. But I got this like get-up together that had like a black cap and a black gown from somewhere and I dressed it all up. I put all kinds of flowers on my cap, and I put all kinds of dangly, dingly things around my neck, and I went in a parade, a parade that the university was putting on, I think several universities in the area. I just paraded around and ____ the parade. And I dreamt that I had a column stand like ____ thing that I could put pens in somebody gave me as a present. And I was trying to get Mom and Merrilee to come, so they'd come by themselves, and that's about all I can remember. I don't know if they ever did."
"C-216"	"#C-216 (2005-02-10 (19)) I was taking a class at Modern Media College, actually I was taking a test in a class, and the instructor was pretty friendly, but the test was about a bunch of confusing data and numbers that I really didn't know about. And they were like at work stations, and each of us had a computer and a CC TV, believe it or not. And we really didn't need the computer for the test, and everybody was using their CC TV. And it was this like third of a sheet of paper that had like the answer things that you bubble in and then a full sheet of paper with the questions. And it was stuff about matching up numbers and letters and like, ""Mode E has 115 different things and Mode Z has 40 different things,"" and just stuff like that. And I think this is kind of a reflection of mini messages, but mini messages are a little more specific than that. This was just crazy stuff being thrown around. And so I did as best as I could, and some of it was even being explained to us as we were taking it, and I remember leaving the work station and going to the middle of the room and sitting down at a big roll-top desk and writing, like for some reason. I don't know what I was writing. Then I would go back and do some more of the test. And somehow that jumped to another little scene when I was done with the test. I didn't know if I was getting married or graduating or if I was just having a birthday, but I was getting these presents in my mailbox, like one person gave me a talking teddy bear with a heart. Another person gave me a little stuffed peacock that you like clip onto something. And about that time I woke up."
"C-217"	"#C-217 (2005-02-12 (19)) Dad and Mom and I were in a hotel for some reason, and we were on some kind of business trip that they had to take care of business, and I can't remember what. But I remember Mom was taking me to an airport and she was showing me how to get around in the airport. And she was gearing me up so that one day I could fly by myself, and in my dream they were like out on the tarmac, like out where the people never go. And I could hear the planes revving up and going around and stuff, and it made me really, really sad, I think because we couldn't go to Jackson this year or something. I always associate lots of fun awaiting me and her, and we fly away from Westport and we go to Jackson and we have a vacation. And I've always loved flying just because I've done it since I was a tiny baby. And the next little scene was that we were home from the hotel and for some reason or another I left my cell phone in the hotel room. Well, first of all, we had this garbage and laundry that we had to deal with, and I guess Dad wanted us to all do it in a very orderly kind of a way. I basically said, ""Well, if you and I are going to do it, I'll do whatever you want, but if he's going to be out there, I'm not doing any of it."" And before that little scene, I remember I saw a groundhog. It looked like a miniature squirrel with no tail, and I was studying it and it was coming out of a little hole, like they do. And I dropped in a little piece of my hair to see what it would do, and it nibbled at it a little bit and then kind of spit it out. [laugh] And I watched it come out of the hole and walk on all fours and go up this hill, and I was looking at it from there with my distance aid. I could get pictures with my distance aid as if it were a camera, and I took three pictures of it. I think while I was looking at the groundhog, I was hearing somebody playing major chords somewhere, but I don't know how or why. It was just sound that was there in my dream. And the last little scene before I woke up is that I was at this CC TV and it was over in the dining room and I was back in Westport, and I had tons of academic work to do, like I had a book report to do in Spanish. And I was looking over the vocabulary list that comes with it and I had all of this other like essays and stuff to do. And I remember feeling confident that I was just going to plough on through it because I was doing it myself. Maybe that came from the fact that I saw Spanish cleaning ladies at Modern Media College and I talked with them, and it made me think about all the vocabulary and stuff that I haven't thought about in a while, which is good, I guess."
"C-218"	"#C-218 (2005-02-13 (19)) For some reason _____________ ________ show, and somehow _______Mrs. Dougherty really well, and through her mother got to help do some of the fashions and I got to help do some of the sound work. And so I dreamt that I was like sitting in our garage at Westport with Celine and she has her short hair, and she has this like thing that's kind of like a guitar amp, but it could amplify any signal, in this case either her voice or somebody else's. And it had most of her reverb settings and program that she has to go through, kind of like the ones in school and how I have such trouble with them because they have everything that you need to know in this display that I can barely read. So ____ program 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- well, she was 4 or 5 and was getting these weird swirly kind of chorus effects, and she said, ""How can I get none of this? How can I get back to having nothing?"" And I suggested going back to program #1 and that works. And she has this other little thing with tons of reverb in it too, and we really couldn't turn it off. [laugh] That was strange. And the next scene we were at Westport High School and I think Mom was ______ or something and she was laying on the couch. And I was getting ready for class and I was in Mrs. Dougherty's class again, and we were ____________ and stuff, and this time I was one of the misbehaving and acting up ones for some reason because Mom was there and every time I thought of something, I wanted to tell her something. And [sigh] I don't remember too much more of how that unfolded. But one of the crazy parts was that there were these little figurines that she passed out of like Celine in different costumes because we were analyzing how the costumes made the mood of the show change. And I said to Mom, ""If there's any extra figures laying around that people like throw on the floor or something, pick them up for me."" You know, they were like leprechauns that you put in cupcakes, and I had one of her in the red. And then I woke up. That was crazy, but I think it has something to do with getting into the production side of things now and how things that become big don't really appear big to the team that's putting them on. And even if they are big, they don't treat everything as though it's going to be big. They go and they do their thing among themselves. "
"C-219"	"#C-219 (2005-02-16 (19)) First of I dreamt that Aunt Janice was here with me, visiting me, and we had been to an audio production seminar together. She was interested in it, I guess, because she could use it to help her business put presentations and stuff together. And I was trying to teach her about wave form editing. She didn't really get it at the seminar, so I offered to have her come back here and I was going to teach her some about it. I had this program that kind of worked like Cool Edit Pro, but it looked like Digital Performer. There was a white background, black glaze, and in some cases the waves really looked like audio waves, but in other cases they were just g___ of a sign wave, like up and down and up and down like in the form of a sign wave. And I couldn't figure out why that was, but somehow it was working for us. About that time somebody knocked on my room door and said that ______ was kind of upset, and she, I went out there and she was holding two dishes in her hands and sitting on the couch and crying. And she said, ""These were in the fridge, and I have to wash them every time."" And I felt bad for her and so I took them from her and they were full of gooey mushroom soup, by the way, and I said, ""Don't worry; I'll wash them tomorrow. It's okay."" I got real close to her like I do with Mom and I kissed her. And she kind of wiped her tears away and everything, and then I went back to editing sound with Aunt Janice, and she was looking around my room while I was doing all that, and I had these weirdo little things around. And I had this tall, skinny extra, extra-exaggerated statue of Pluto that she was looking at, and I had this blue cow statue with a yellow bow on its collar. Actually it wasn't a statue; it was a cut-out out of felt. And she said, ""Oh, you have the blue cow. I love blue cows."" [laugh] And she wanted me to record her talking about the cow statue into my editing program so that we could learn about editing using that audio. And that's about all I can remember."
"C-220"	"#C-220 (2005-02-20 (19)) I had a crazy dream last night, that I was back in Westport and that I was having classes at Westport College just for the month that I was in town, just so that I could have something to do. I really didn't want to go to them. I had a class that started at 5:00 and ended at 9:00, just like I do at Modern Media College. But it was about history or something. And I was explaining about how Mom and Dad were going off and that they were going to be doing some errands so they could bring me there, but that I was going to have a cab bring me home. And while I was there, I was staying at this like commons dorm-like type thing instead of at the house, and I had my own room with a bed like I do here, and I had to go to another place to take a shower. And I took my shower, well, before I took my shower, I was on the couch with two girls and a boy. They had this thing that belonged to one of the girls, and this is whacko. What it was, was like something that sort of looked like the two mikes that we were talking about in class, but it was more like this kind of hypnotist therapy thing where you hypnotize people with it. And what it did is that it sends out a certain electrical field, sort of you hold it and you swirl it around someone's head so that the electrical field sort of whirls around their head and relaxes and hypnotizes them and whatever. And it would also create the sound of certain musical notes as you hold it close or further away from somebody's head, kind of like a Theremin. You could change the strength of the electrical field. They were all teasing around like teenagers do. This boy decides he's going to try it on me. It's okay at first, but then he's holding it a little too close to my head and it's not good, so I'm trying to take his hand and make him back it away. In doing that, I bumped the switch to change the electrical field, and then it was really strong and making all these arching sounds, and I couldn't stand it. And I think I finally got away from him and got into the shower place and got my shower. And when I was done there, I had to get back to my dorm room and I was totally naked. And in this place it was okay to run totally naked from the shower to your dorm room, but I couldn't find my dorm room. All these little hallways and things that I would run down, and I would open the door and it would be somebody else's room with somebody else's stuff, and I would go to another place that I thought was mine, and there were two boys watching TV. And I closed the door and they didn't say anything like about they saw me or anything, but I woke up without ever finding my room, I guess."
"C-221"	"#C-221 (2005-02-21 (19)) There were people that lived in our complex that were having a wedding, and they invited Jill and I. In my dream we were close to water, and at these peoples' place they had this house and they had this pool and then in the back they had a boat, but it was more like a big, big ship. This place was close enough that I could walk from my apartment. And so Jill and I walked over and once we got there, we kind of like parted ways, like we wouldn't be together. And I walked around and I looked at things. I walked around the pool and I was careful not to fall in because it was actually kind of cold, but I went in these scruffy-looking shorts and this pink sweater with gold sleeves. It was still kind of tame; people were getting ready, but the bride hadn't changed yet. She was still in like beach clothes, and I didn't even know who she was. I didn't know why anybody was. And, but they were real warm and friendly. They seemed to know me real well. I think a girl and her father and the son were kind of milling around. Nobody had already changed yet. They did a little bit of stuff and I was thinking how, man, it would have been so nice if I could have the Peavey system and DJ for them. I was thinking how I couldn't have gotten it from Westport to here and here to there in an hour, so that was kind of a lost cause. After a while, when everybody went to change, I went back to my apartment to change into shorts, and I didn't know what happened to Jill. She must have went off with some other people or something. And I put long pants on and kept my pink sweater with the gold sleeves. [laugh] At that time I think they were like starting to serve some food and I got a little bit, and then they were going to take everybody on the ship for the actual party. They didn't actually do any exchanging of vows or anything. They just had like a reception party, and everybody was changed into their clothes and everybody was all authentic and everything, and we were on this big ship. It reminded me of the Prince Eric ship. And I went out on -- it wasn't tall like the Titanic, but it sure was long -- and I went out on the deck and I sat out there to look out on the water. In my dream I feel asleep, and I fell asleep while all the partying was going on. Whoever was captaining the ship came to get me to say that he had come back to dock and that it was time to go back to the house. And he was real nice and, you know, when I step on and off of a boat, I have to take somebody's hand, and he gave me both hands like I need and he kind of helped me get on dry land. And then when I went into the house, Mom was there, and she was helping them pick up the food and clean up everything, and I didn't get to have any wedding cake because I was asleep, and so she gave me some. And there was this milk bottle thing that I felt was going to have milk in it and so I poured some in a cup and I was going to have cake and milk, but instead what it was, was some kind of cleaning stuff and I took a sip and I was like, ""Bleah!"" and it was a good thing I didn't swallow. .... Hey, that was perfect timing. Did you hear how that tape didn't flip until I was done? I've never had good timing like that before. Let me just sure things happened when they were supposed to.... And the night before I had a dream that I didn't get a chance to put on the tape, that I will now. Kind of goofy. I dreamt that I was still in the middle of my program at Modern Media College, but it was Christmas again already. Mom and Dad and Sandra, and I think Samantha and Derek, were coming to visit me. And my room was a little bigger than it actually was, and I had wooden floors in this place, and it was kind of dark. And I had the two _____ was plugged in, and I had the angels and swan thing on my dresser, like I do. We were all sitting around in here. There weren't enough chairs so everybody was on the floor in the space in front of my bed, over by the computer table and the dresser, the big open area. We were all sitting around in a circle in that area. We were talking about how we were going to go from my place to Westport in a whole like caravan train [laugh] and Mom and Dad were doing to drive their car and Samantha and Derek were going to go in theirs and Sandra was going to go in hers, and we were going to just do a caravan train. And we were bringing a bunch of furniture and stuff with us, as though I were going to move back. Mom had brought me the cheap TV trays like she told me she was going to, but when we went back to Westport, she brought them back. And in my dream we were going to bring all my Christmas decorations and things, for what reason I don't know. And without my really knowing, Mom packed my keyboard in the stuff to go home. When we got home, she set it up on the kitchen table, with the tablecloth folded back, and she wanted me to play her a song while she was wrapping Christmas presents. And I kind of kept procrastinating and dawdling a little because I knew that everybody was outside and they were going to come in the back door and they were going to start parading through the kitchen any minute. And so, sure enough, they did and I told Mom, ""Come one, we've got to flip the tablecloth down."" And so she flipped the tablecloth down and nobody saw anything and they paraded through the kitchen. In my dream they didn't even have a Christmas tree up yet because something funny happened and she didn't get to put it up. So I don't remember, I think we were going to do something like that. And that was really all I can remember."
"C-222"	"#C-222 (2005-02-27 (19)) First of all I dreamt that I was in this classroom at Modern Media College that had desks in it, but everybody like moved to the front of the room and was listening to a lecture about something, I don't remember quite what. But I kind of, somebody told me that this was normally a Pro Tools lab, but it was going to be a lecture room for today. And we were having a lecture about Midi (?) and they were going to play us this sequence and solo out different parts, and have us listen to the way the different parts combine, and they did some of that. And -- oh, next thing I know, all of these people are at our house in Westport and we're, the instructor is there and everybody is there, and we're trying to build this same sequence and they have like a synthesizer, I guess. For this part when we were in our living room, it was this big stocky synth in the middle of our rug and everybody was all crowded around. And next when Mom and Dad walked in [part unhearable] and there was like a bunch of stuff, and they just basically did some cleaning up and all because all of us are really into what we're doing. Oh, and the next part is really good. I dreamt that it was time for me to be in lab, and so I was in lab. And Mom was there with me so that when I need to find something on the screen and I didn't know where it was, she would point it out to me. And when I work on the computer and Mom is there, I'm really lazy because there's something that I want to find, like a document or something and I open the folder and I say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it so I don't have to, because I could find it myself, but I just say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it and we go from there. So I dreamt that she was there doing that for me in lab, and it was really crazy because we had to go to the start menu and select various views or sections for various examples, and I was having a hard time selecting the right one. And each one had like something different on the desktop and then when I opened up the sequence program, she would help me find certain little things that I needed to find. I don't remember what program we were using, but I just remember being glad that she was there. And then after a while she went to sit in the back of the room, and chat away with the instructor just like she used to do when I was in middle school or high school sometimes. And then I woke up."
"C-223"	"#C-223 (2005-03-01 (19)) Man, I screwed myself over. What I did is instead of turning on Alarm #1 that is set for 7:14 so that I can wake up in time to do my thing and wake up and eat my breakfast and get dressed before lab at 9:00 -- our class, I mean, at 9:00 -- I turned on Alarm #2 which is set for 5:17, and it just came on and woke me up and now I'm wide awake and it's 5:30 in the morning, and I don't know if I'm going to go back to sleep or I'm just going to stay up, but now I'm all wired for sound because I'm starting to have thoughts go through my mind about all kinds of stuff, and I'm very bad about just turning my brain off. [laugh] Because my brain is always thinking. Okay, so now that I'm awake at this hour and this goofy dream is fresh in my mind, I'm going to put it on the tape. I dreamt that I had to give Christina a flower arrangement. I guess it was for her graduation or her birthday or something. I didn't really want to because she was being a conceited snob to me. Now Christina usually is okay to us, but I hear that she can be quite a snob, so I guess that's what this is based on. And it was just like three roses and some other flowers, so went over to, it turns out that it's not Christina, it's Jill. And Jill had a thought that she wanted me to hold the g_____ while she taped, and I did that and she thanked me and she was surprised. And, let's see what I remember. Oh, we were sitting in the living room, Mom and I, and we were eating this crazy pudding-like type dessert with Cheerios thrown in it. And Mom said that that was something that Melinda used to do. And I dreamt that that evening Melinda had invited us to go to her house, and Mom and I were going to kind of sneak out the back door and walk over there. [laugh] I don't think we ever made it over there, but she was saying how she was going to give us root beer floats and stuff. And the last scene is that I was on a playground at a school, I think, and there was a boy about 10 or 11 and he wanted me to tell him the difference between a May (?) controller and an arranger model. And about that time I woke up."
"C-224"	"#C-224 (2005-03-03 (19)) I have got a 1:00 am MIDI lab tomorrow morning and I am supposed to be getting in the lab and going to sleep, and I think I'm heading in that direction. I didn't do any practicing tonight because I didn't want to get myself all keyed up (ha ha ha!) [laugh] , but for some reason I'm all keyed up anyway. I did something boring. I read my Media and Society book with my eyes, not with App Reader on the CD Rom, so that I'd get really tired and really bored and I'd start going to sleep like I'm supposed to. But I don't know, stuff just started getting back into my head, and I started getting all excited, like I did. [laugh] I remember the goosey dream that I had last night. I dreamt that it was Christmas time again, of all things, and Mom and Dad were coming to visit me and I got a week off for Christmas in this dream. And they were going to bring me home, and I was in Sound Foundation class, and Erik, the _____ chorus director/ instructor decides that he's not going to give us a week off for Christmas. He decides he's going to extend our classes -- the Monday-Wednesday and Friday into the Christmas break week just because he thinks that we're like students that need like, we need to be punished for some reason. And that's what he did. And so in my dream I had to work out logistics of going to class, dealing with having a visit for Christmas and all, and in this one scenario I actually thought that I was going to leave class and walk to my apartment, which I do, but keep going until I got to Westport And then I was just going to meet everybody at home on the weekend. But then something changed and they were going to come to my apartment and pick me up. And so the scenario, the little scene that I remember the best is that I had a picnic lunch and I was sitting down on the curb in the parking lot and I was eating it. And I packed it all away, I took my shoes off and put them in my book bag, and it had just rained, so I was going to walk home barefoot and slop and splash in the all puddles like I still like to do. I hate getting my feet wet if I'm wearing any kind of shoes, but if I'm barefoot, I love to slop and splash in puddles. And as I was going through the first puddle, I woke up."
"C-225"	"#C-225 (2005-03-09 (19)) I've got a 1:00 am lab tonight, or tomorrow morning. I am supposed to be, I should have been asleep an hour ago, but I'm all keyed up for some reason again. I had a funny dream last night, and I should have recorded it this morning, but I was too sleepy and too lazy and I had to get to class. I laid in bed until the last minute. [laugh] So I didn't. And now, I ______________ read a wonderful story. Oh, it's a fairy tale story book story. [laugh] And I'm too bashful to really talk that much about it. And I've been laying here all this time thinking about it and how I need to write a song about it. And I just remembered this goofy dream I had last night, and I decided now would be a good time to record it. Okay, here's how it goes. I dreamt it was my birthday, which my birthday isn't too far away, so that's not surprising. And I dreamt that Mom and Dad went somewhere, and I was back at Westport in their house, and I had been on a walk with them and I came home early, and the neighbors stopped them or something and were talking to them. And I thought there were some birthday presents on the kitchen table, so for some reason or another, I climbed up on the kitchen stool over by the refrigerator and it turned into this like tall ladder. And there was this rafter beam that went the length of the kitchen, that really isn't there, but it was there in my dream. And I got on my hands and my knees and I crawled across that rafter beam, and then I kind of swung myself down off of it and put my feet on one of the kitchen chairs, because I thought if I would just walk, then I would leave footprints and then they would know I'd been over there. And it turned out there weren't any presents on the table. It was just a vase of flowers. And I didn't seem to mind that there weren't any presents though. I was just curious to know if there were any. Then I went upstairs and I was looking around for my MiniDisc recorder, because I had a feeling they were planning a party, and I couldn't find it. I had a feeling Mom like unpacked my bags and put all my stuff all over the stuff like hide and seek. And so then I started looking for this tape machine as an alternative, and I couldn't find it either, and I knew I had brought both of them when I came. Then all of a sudden there were these people downstairs, a bunch of our neighbors and friends that were all coming over and they were ready for a party, and we were going to have a birthday party with them. And it was a surprise party that they sort of sprung. And I looked really ______ around the house for either my MiniDisc recorder or my tape machine because I couldn't let this event go by. And I couldn't find them, and then like three minutes went by, and I decided, okay, I'd better give it up and go down and join the party and just let my memory do the recording. So I went down and by that time there were only like two people left. It's like everybody came, they shuffled through, they whooped and whooped and partied it up, and like three minutes later they were gone. And by the time I got downstairs there was no party; I had missed the party. And it was just Dad and these two people. And pretty soon the two people left too and it was just Mom and Dad and me. And for some reason I was sitting on the floor near the receiver in the living room and the CD player over there, and they were on, but there was nothing coming out of them. Dad was giving one of his long spiels about something again. I think it was about, hmmm, I can't even remember what it was about, but it was about something stupid, I think. And I was thinking how I really would want to be at a birthday party instead of sitting there listening to all that. And then I woke up."
"C-226"	"#C-226 (2005-03-19 (19)) I can only remember bits and pieces of it, though. I woke up in the middle of the night and kind of laid for a while, so some of it got lost. But I remember first that I dreamt that I was here and that Jill's parents were coming to take care of a signature she needed on a check or something. And she was vacuuming my room with a little dust buster thing that made kind of a high squeaky kind of sound, and when they walked in, everybody said, ""Hi."" And I said, ""Hi"" back. And she said, ""I know Jasmine will enjoy having you."" If they really were coming, I would have enjoyed having them. And before that, I think I was back in Westport and I was standing on the back hallway, I actually was in the kitchen looking out at the back hallway and there was a kitchen standing in the back hall, looking in at us. I remember saying something like, I don't remember, I think we were going to go somewhere and do something, I don't know. After that we were in this fancy restaurant with a family that we knew. I think it was Melinda's family. It was Mom and Dad and I and Melinda, and we were eating this fancy food. I had this little stuffed dog that I was thinking of buying from the restaurant, and it was $90. And then I decided, that is ridiculous. I am leaving that darned thing. Before all that I have a vague memory that I dreamt that I was in this, in the area, in the balcony area that overlooked like this big open space. I was up there with a few other people and Alex was setting up this live rig and he was going to give a demonstration to people that gathered down in the open space. I think I was standing around in the way watching. He had a mixer and a big, heavy PA system, and that's about all I can remember."
"C-227"	"#C-227 (2005-03-20 (19)) The night before last I also had kind of an interesting dream, that was kind of boring, I guess, but not really. I dreamt that Mom actually did come up here Sunday before my birthday, and the first little scene was we were kind of in my neighborhood here, I guess, somewhere where there's a big open field. There really isn't any, but I _______. That's funny. I don't know why I said that, but we were in my neighborhood here and there was a big open field and we were running in it, and we were kind of running and chasing each other, kind of like what we did in the park one day. And she was planning this surprise for me, and it turns out that her and Dad were taking me to this place where you could experience virtual reality, and it's like the big high whoo-whoo, or it's supposed to be anyway. And I got there and all it is, all the hype that it is, is that you sit down in a chair with an orange light and it kind of skates around the room a little and there's these sounds that play. And like about after ten minutes of that, everybody was like, ""Wowowowow."" I don't know. And then in the next little scene it's like totally out of context, but I was in that same place, but it looked like the MIDI lab at Modern Media College with fluorescent lights blasting on everybody, because in the MIDI lab they keep really dim lighting so that if you need to see your monitor ___________ and stuff. But in here the fluorescent lights were bright, and nobody had moved the monitor for me or anything, but I still had to do my assignment. And there was this man, this really prissy man in a tuxedo, sitting next to me with a tie, and I had to tell him everything that I wanted to do, and how I wanted to do it. And he would interface with the machine and do it for me. And on the one hand, that was a way I could work, but on the other hand, it pretty much took all the creativity out of it because you were working through a medium pretty much. I mean I guess here is that [sigh] , I don't know, it's just not good when you've got to work through somebody else. And then Dad showed up and we went to this theme park, and I think it was Disneyland, but in my dream theme parks we don't really do that much. I think that I was on a roller coaster or something. And that's about all I can remember."
"C-228"	"#C-228 (2005-03-21 (19)) I don't know why I'm getting like this, but this morning when my alarm came on, I jumped up and I was kind of afraid that, I got real nervous because I thought I missed the lab. And it took me a minute to remember and sort out the confusion that Sunday night I got to sleep all night and this is Monday morning, and that Monday night was going to be my next lab. And I had to remember that Saturday night was my last one. I hope I don't do that next month if my labs are during the day. That's going to be crazy. But anyway, I had a dream last night that I had a class on the second floor of Modern Media College's building, which in Building 1 there aren't that many classrooms on the second floor. There's mainly administrative offices up there. But in my dream there was like classroom after classroom just like there is in a public school. And so I had a class up there and we were doing some kind of droop (?) work and all of a sudden we had a fire drill and it sounded like a high, shrill 1000 cicadas kind of alarm that you hear at the Media Center at Westport High School. And so there was this fire escape like type thing that was this metal stairway thing that led out the back way that we could go down. And it was so loud back there! I think I might have covered my ears, and it was still so loud, but not only was the alarm loud, there was some kind of water sprayer going on out there that was really loud. And then all of a sudden it all stopped, but there was like water at the bottom of the stairwell that would beep, and you had to swim across it to go to the little field area where you were supposed to stand. And I didn't really have a problem swimming; it was that the water smells and I didn't want to swim in the smelly water and get it all over me. So I got down in it and I went a little ways, and then I turned around because I decided that I didn't want to, and I was going to go back up the stairs and wait for people on the stairwell. All of a sudden all of these thorns started showing up on the railings and some even on the steps, so I figured, okay, I guess I'm, I waffled for a little bit, and I think I finally went over to this place where people stand. And then the whole class was gone. There was just one or two girls over there, and they were talking about how they made a pregnant Barbie or something, but they had to make a rap song along with it that proved its father was there somewhere. And they made a DVD about it too. [laugh] And that's when I woke up."
"C-229"	"#C-229 (2005-03-23 (19)) It's a very rainy morning. It's one of the worst weather days I've seen since I've been here. But it's summer time and we all know what happens in the summer time, so I should starting expecting it, I guess. Last night I had a dream that I was back in Westport and it was Easter time, but for some reason it was real cold outside, as though it were winter, and we had to put on jackets before we went outside. And I think either Mom or Dad -- no, it was some guy that was our neighbor -- wanted to take our pictures out there while I was home, and so we had to bundle all up and go out there. There was a swing out there that was built like Grammy's, where there weren't chains hanging from a tree; they were just hanging from a little, teensy metal thing at your head level. And, you know, they had gardens and flowers and stuff, and eggs hidden in various places, and I don't understand why it was so cold, but the scenery looked like spring. And we had a baby chick running around, a bunny running around, you know, like we used to have rabbits galore, except this rabbit was crazy. It was a live, running around rabbit, but you would pet it, like you would pet its head and it would say something. Or you would pet its back and it would say something. And I had the notion that they genetically engineered it like that, and I kind of thought that was so wrong. I thought rabbits are supposed to be rabbits in their own little right, their own little creature, and their body language should convey what they mean. And we shouldn't go messing with them like that. But that was like off the wall, man! And I know there was so more to this dream; let me think a minute. The only other thing I can remember is that I think Sandra showed up somewhere in this, and I had like a big, flat briefcase full of my school papers that I was showing to this neighbor. One other thing that I should note here: the rabbit that was whacko was a white one, and it was the size and weight and everything of just a regular bunny running around, that you get at the pet store. And the baby chick was yellow. I don't know if that means anything, but I've heard that colors are very significant, so I thought that I would include that."
"C-230"	"#C-230 (2005-03-26 (20)) I was back in the Media Lab at Modern Media College and I was taking my test out, just like I did the day before, except there was this man there that was like a cross between Stuart and Alec. He was like the course director who was giving the lab test, instead of the lab guys. And what we had to do for test, instead of being able to navigate through the software and know what to do to make what goes ding-a-ling or whatever, we had to actually, we had to play competently into the sequencer and make a coherent musical sequence and know what notes were and stuff. And if you couldn't do that, then our test was like ""pffffffff."" And around -- this room was like really big, there were like forty lab stations in it, and it looked different than the one that we have. Instead of being kind of angled back like ours is, this one was straight up, like everything was pretty much straight on top of each other, and the monitor was like, the base of it was at my forehead level. And so I sat down and I started doing what I could do, and I couldn't get any notes to come out of the thing. It was like it was some kind of synthesizer was on this patch that had like crazy sound effect noises like police sirens and frizzy ""aaaaash"" sounds and trash cans opening and dumb things like that. And around me taking the test were little kids, like 5 and 6-year-olds and they knew what they were doing right away and everything. And they seemed to really enjoy it. And I think there was something else in this dream that touched a chord with me, but I don't remember what it was now. That's kind of a bummer."
"C-231"	"#C-231 (2005-03-29 (20)) Something's screwy with this tape. I just got halfway through my whole spiel here and realized that this tape isn't even going. It stopped and it got held up on the ______ wagon, you know that rap song where they go, ""Hold up."" Well, that's what this is. Well, now I see that it's going again, so now I can start blabbing away again. Well, I guess this is take 2. It's my birthday. I'm going to party like it's my birthday. I really can't party like it's my birthday, but I wish I could. But I had an interesting dream last night that I still can remember a lot of the details. And so I figure I may as well just break open a new tape and start recording it. I dreamt that I was having classes back at Westport High School, but two of them were my Modern Media College classes and two were just ""blah"" General Ed classes. I think I dreamt that I had Audiotronics, Media and Signing, Spanish and PE, and I had Spanish with Mrs. Hanover, and I was there my first day and I had Spanish first period. And let's see. I was doing some kind of book work for her. I think I was doing like a test or something that was like four pages long, and I only got through the first page and a half of it, and the other people had to turn it in right away and she was real serious about it, but she said I could come in later and finish it. And when I left there, went to another class, I can't remember what it was, but I didn't have my printed schedule yet because the system was so screwed up and they weren't ready to give them out. So I had these other two classes that I kept missing because I didn't know what time they were being held and what time I was supposed to be there. So I thought I was going to call the school and say, ""Hey, look, what's going on with this? I have two classes but I keep missing them."" And then I realized that I lost my book bag and my purse and I was walking around and walking around campus. And the way the campus looked is that it had one building that looked a lot like a house because it had bedrooms up top and like a student lounge thing that I wandered into, and it had a TV and a pool table and a couch and things. But at the student lounge area I didn't notice right away, but there was this steep ramp down and I slid and tripped and ended up falling flat on my face. And I got up and sort of climbed my way back up. And then I went up the stairs and went into this bedroom, and there was nobody in there. I kept walking around and around these halls asking people if they'd seen my book bag, and then I went home and I realized that my book bag and my purse were both under the gardenia bush by our back window, our back door. So then I laid a towel down in the yard and I called Westport High School with my cell phone and I talked to Mrs. Lipp, and I was saying, ""I've got these other two classes that I keep missing because I don't have my schedule yet. Can you please tell me what time they're going to meet?"" And I woke up before she could tell me. That was crazy."
"C-232"	"#C-232 (2005-04-04 (20)) I was at the park with Mom and Dad in Westport and I was coloring these dinosaurs. And I was mainly coloring a stegosaurus and I was going to make the body green and the spikes yellow. And I had the notion that it was going to be a design for a robot dinosaur and it was going to be mechanical. And I was also trying to do math problems. They were simple addition and subtraction problems that were six digits, four whole numbers and then two decimal places. And Mom said I should do these math problems so that I would be able to balance my checkbook better. And I kept doing mistakes, like I couldn't do my subtraction really well on the first one, and on the second one I subtracted the cents and added the dollars. [laugh] I don't think I've done that in a while actually. Then the next thing I was riding in a truck with Dad, and he was going to drop me off in another part of the park, a part where I could walk home from. And he was playing a tape. The truck radio in real life has a tape deck in it, but the tape deck has never ever, ever, ever been used. And I don't even dare put a tape in it because I'm afraid it'll eat it as those things do. Well, in my dream Dad was playing a tape in the truck and it was this instructional story tape of how to put digital robot dinosaur together that I was trying to do. And it had some really soft and sweet music on it, and it was really an interesting thing to listen to. And it sort of just had that soft sound appeal that I like. He dropped me off and I had my portable tape player. Actually it was a big heavy one from APH in the talking book library, and he gave me the tape out of the front of the unit, and he said, ""No, here, wait a minute. Let me rewind it."" So I sat there with the door open for a minute while he rewinded it, I mean he rewound it -- what am I saying? I'm tired, can you tell? Then I got out and I started walking towards the tree where I was going to sit down and listen to the tape, and then I realized that this tape player that I had needed batteries and I didn't have any. And then I woke up."
"C-233"	"#C-233 (2005-04-05 (20)) It's evening time again. I don't know why I wait until evening to do these lately, I guess because I was pretty ""bleah"" this morning and I had a lot of stuff on my mind, and I guess I just didn't remember the dream very much this morning. And as I went on through the day, subtle things kept popping back to me -- things that I saw, things that heard -- and by the end of the day I put it together as a puzzle and only certain parts, though, are kind of clear. And so I'll tell what I remember. I dreamt that, well, first of all, there's several little things that are coming together here. This dream takes place in the area that is the shopping zoo that I cross every day to go to Modern Media College, basically the whole area between the AT&T place and the Dollar Store. But in my dream around the U, instead of being stores, there were classrooms, and these classrooms were where we were going to have some of our classes. And the doors were white with clear glass panes up at like the chest level, and the arch just like all the doors that Westport High School had, you know, like my Spanish classroom and the door to the Little Theater and the door to this and the door to that. They were all like that. Well, that's how these doors were. And I had the notion that the material that was going to be taught in these classes was Modern Media College's material, but they were treating us like we were elementary school students, like, for example, when we went to lunch we had to walk in a straight line to go to the cafeteria. But other than that, they pretty much treated us like adults. There was this Spanish lady and this man and they were like team teaching, you know how in lab there are several people and they are all kind of teaching at once. And this class was going to be kind of like Song Craft, but instead of just knowing what the song was about and analyzing it, you had to actually perform something original. You could either stand up in front of the class and sing, or you could beat on the board or you could kind of clap your hands or something, but you had to go up there and do something. And so I was pretty kind of interested because there were these four boys, one of them had like a little, like a tiny like kids' toy drum set. I think one of them was going to play a trombone or something and three of them each had keyboards. And I think there was another one that was going to sing. And these people, I guess they were going to take their turn going up there and plugging into the sound system and getting everybody's attention or something. And they sent me to go and get something from across the U, and so they took their time fiddling around and I think they needed to wait for somebody to unlock the door, so I got on this chair that you roll around in, like a chair that you find in labs that you just roll around the room in, except this chair was orange. And I rolled this chair all the way across the U over to the other side, and I just sat there. And I sat there and I sat there and I sat there, and I didn't even remember what I had to go and get. And then I looked at the time and I was like, ""Oh, my gosh!"" and I had to zoom back. So I rolled my little orange chair across that parking as fast as I could to get to the other side of the U. And it turned out that everybody had already performed and I had totally missed all the performances because I dawdled too long. And all the guys with their instruments were walking out of the room. And I think I have to make a note here that the toy drum set was orange, and the three guys who had keyboard cases were orange too. Their cases were orange. And I was thinking, ""Oh, man, that's just a bummer. I wish I could have heard these guys."" And then I sort of faded into consciousness, gradually, as I was still seeing orange things. And then I realized it wasn't such a bummer because it was all just a stupid dream."
"C-234"	"#C-234 (2005-04-09 (20)) First I dreamt that Mom and I were riding around these antsy parking lots on the bike and she went to Public to do some shopping, and she took some of Public's cards and was going to hand them out at the fruit stand. And Publics gave her three Easter baskets because of that. One was kind of a normal one, one was small, kind of like, and the other one was really small. And in the really small one there was a ducky and these four or five little clips that you clip bags together closed with, but she called them short-its, and when I thought these short-it things were, were things that you strip away some of the wire and you put this clip there, so that when somebody steps on it, it shorts out the circuit and goes, ""Ahhhhhhhhh!"" That's funny. And so we rode the bike home, happy because we had all these Easter baskets and all these presents we were going to send people. And we got home and the front door was wide open, and now we're talking about back in Westport and that's like a major crime there. And the chicken was around pecking at some bread that was really, really moldy, and there was a bunch of garbage laying around the yard. And Dad was so sad about the fact that there was so much garbage around the yard and the chicken had moldy bread, and that the house hadn't been swept in a week. And he was just so like in a blue funk, like he gets, except he was so down that he was questioning the quality of his life. And I said something to him, I think, and he just came back with some stupid comment, which he has been known to do that after Mom and Dad had had a falling out and I say something about going on and doing something else, he'll come back with some really stupid comment sometimes. [laugh] But anyway, in this dream I just went on about my business and I was sitting in the porch swing kind of talking to the bird, I guess, and then he came by and said, ""You know, I think I know what would really make me happy. I would like to take a VCR to the park and watch an instructional video about adjusting brake alignment."" And he said that there was something in an engine called the equalizer adjustment. And I had the notion that it didn't have to do with sound, but it had to do with the equalizing of how the parts lined up. But I thought it was strange that there was something termed like that in an engine, and so what would make him happy was to take a VCR to the park and watch a video about calibrating an engine basically. And so, now in real life, I don't think that would do the trick. I'll take a moment to tell a story here. In real life, when we were coming home from Janna's wedding, that trip was the most awful trip I can remember in my life, and Dad was laying in the back seat and Mom was driving, and I was sitting up front with her. And when we stopped at a rest stop to eat some picnic, he turned his back and wouldn't even touch any of the food or water that we were putting out, and when somebody came over to ask him about the car, he was like, ""Yeah, thanks."" And usually he's all excited and wanting to show them what's what, and wanting to ask them about the one they used to have. But this time he was like, ""Yeah, thank you."" So back to this dream. I think I said everything, and I think the reason why I'm thinking about, oh, I think the reason why I'm thinking about the word ""equalizer"" as being a part of an engine is because we had analog tape cal (?) lab last night, and it took me a while to understand that the tape EQ pot thing was really just an up or down boost for 10k only, and when you feed 10k through from the mil, you got to tweak the 10k thing so it'll be even all around, you know what I mean? That's all."
"C-235"	"#C-235 (2005-04-12 (20)) I was going to Spain again, and I don't know how I was going to swing it, being a student here. I think I was taking a leave of absence or something. And I lived here, and in my dream the night before I was supposed to leave, I decided I was going to turn on my sound system and blast some classic rock kind of stuff. And I didn't think Jill was here; it was like 12:30 at night. And so I blasted it, and then five minutes later I realized that she might be here and she might be sleeping. Now this is all in my dream, you know. And so I turned it down, but I couldn't get it to go quiet enough, so I turned it off. And I laid back down and Jill came and knocked on my door and said, ""Are you ready to wake up now?"" And so they got me up again. I dreamt that she was going to Spain with me. So we packed, we kind of packed our stuff together, and then I guess Jill turns into Astrid somehow and I dreamt that Astrid was going with me. Maybe _____ there were these other people. And I dreamt that these different teachers were driving students to the airport. There was this big open field where we were standing waiting to go, and I was pretty sad about leaving for some reason. I was kind of excited and sad at the same time, but I was telling Dad how the last time I was gone, one month kind of felt like two years, and I was saying how I was going to be sad about not hearing any English for a while. And I don't know, he said something like, I don't know, something in _____ forgot what it was now. And so me and these three other people piled into Mrs. Hollander's car. I was in the front, Astrid and two 10-year-old boys were in the back, even though this was supposed to be high school students. I don't know how me and two 10-year-olds got to go, but it was something. And we started driving down the road, down these rural country roads, looking at this rural scenery on the way to the airport. And she said, ""What radio station do you guys like to listen to?"" And I like ________. This 10-year-old boy said that there was one called ""Blah"" and [laugh] it was just sort of like a version of 93.3 in Westport where they talk a lot, so we listened to that for a while. And then she flipped over to something on am for a while. And then we were at this rest stop, and so we're still on the way to the airport, we're at a rest stop, though. And I have a handful of money. I have some American quarters, two American dimes, two American pennies and two 200 poseida (?) coins. Boy, I'm wasting tape here; oh well. And I'm standing at this rest stop and everybody's kind of going and doing their thing. And the 10-year-old boy suddenly turns into a 16-year-old and he gets out of Mrs. Hollander's car and Mrs. Hollander gives him a coupon for beer, but she says, ""Now you must come back with non-alcoholic beer."" And I'm standing there and everybody's running off and I feel kind of sad still, and Mom shows up at this rest stop. And I'm standing there and I'm kind of leaning on her, like I do, and telling her all about how I feel and stuff. And she's kind of there like saying goodbye, and then she said, ""Hey, come on. Come with me because I need to surprise you."" When we were at the place where the cars and the buses pull in, there's like a busy road, and on this busy road there's this place for walkers. It's like a revolving door, but it's not. It's like a track, a people mover that's only very, very narrow that you have to step on, and it curves you around across the street in kind of a curved shape, and it's supposed to keep you from getting hit by cars when you cross the street. And it had this thing between the place where the vehicles in and all of the like drink stands and stuff at the restaurant. So Mom says, ""Hey, come with me."" And she thinks she's going to cheer me up by taking me over to this drink stand and buying me a Slurpy. And actually I was going to buy it with my 200 poseida (?) coin, but we were still in America. I don't understand that. So she hurried across this thing and she forgot that I can't jump on this thing without somebody helping me. It's like, whenever I get on a boat, I always have to have somebody take my hands and kind of make sure I don't step in the water, instead of, you know, it's a thing about depth perception. And so I'm standing there and I'm standing there and I'm waving my hand and yelling for help, for somebody to help me get across this thing so that we'd still have some time to drink our Slurpy before we had to get on the road. And I drop my 200 poseida coins in the mulch and I'm waving my hands and yelling for somebody to help me, and this nice boy who was getting off the thing helps me get on it, like takes my two hands and helps me step the right distance, and he even picks up my 200 poseida coins and gives them back to me. As I jump on this thing and I almost fell backwards, and I grab the person in front of me's shoulders just so that I could keep my balance and not fall off. And I'm on this thing and I'm almost to the Slurpy stand, and then I woke up."
"C-236"	"#C-236 (2005-04-15 (20)) I was in Westport and we were going to go to the Night Parade or something. I had this really big over-sized storybook with like 20 point font in them, and they were all laying around the living room, and I don't remember why, but we were sitting in the living room talking about things that when the police are going by in the parade they would look for. And what kind of a red flag go up with FBI agents. One of the things that Dad said that he would find commonly in the department is that when somebody sends an SOX message, the police and the FBI would think they would mix it up with some other kind of message that would mean that they're getting ready to have a plot to blow something up or something. You know that an SOX message really is the start of exclusive ______. When somebody's sending SISEX messages, but apparently it had the certain number of zeros and ones that just matched up to something bad in this dream. And I don't know where that would come from, but then the next part of this dream, I was upstairs in the bathroom and I had a silver mixer. It was like shiny silver and the faders were g____ silver. It was just all silver and it had little LEDs on it that would come on when a certain channel was active. So I sat this silver mixer on one TV tray and I set up the keyboard on two more TV trays, and I think I had some kind of other, I think I set up the CD player on the floor and ran wires to it all. And I don't remember why I did that. I don't know how I was going to amplify it in the bathroom either, but I think Mom just wanted to see how it was set up. And then we were upstairs on the little landing area hallway, and that old CC TV was still over there, and I had this big over-sized storybook about The Night Before Christmas, I guess, and I was reading it there and Mom was reading it out loud, like as I moved the tray across and I chose a word, she would read them out loud. And Dad was coming up the stairs wondering what we were doing, and Mom was like, ""We're reading a story about Santa Claus."" And I was kind of embarrassed because this was the middle of the year and Night Parade time. And then I woke up."
"C-237"	"#C-237 (2005-04-16 (20)) First I dreamt that I had to walk to Fourth Street Shipping in the middle of the night for some reason. And it was really hot. And I was in Westport, and I got there and I got the package to them, and coming back I went by Circle Lake Park, which is totally in the opposite direction, but I passed it in my dream. And I had _______ because they were blocking the way, and then there was a school bus dropping kids off at that hour, and as the bus stopped I kind of ran ahead of it so I could get by all the commotion. And then, when I got back, the next little scene was that it was daytime and for some reason Dad had to go out of town to deal with something with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, I think, and I think Uncle Carl was over here at Westport helping us out with some things around the house while he was away. And I think Mom was going to hang some wash outside and she wanted us to play a tape for her in the bedroom out the window like you do so that she could hear it out there. Now in my dream by the bedroom receiver there was still a tape deck, and for some reason Uncle Carl was sitting in the bedroom and he wanted me to go ahead and put it on, but then he started to work with it, and when he turned it on, it was on tuner and it was on like 94.1 or something, but he said that a message popped up and then displayed that said, ""Low power, do not adjust the volume."" And he said that it translates to that the whole house was on less than 110 volts and that the power company had somehow messed up there. And Uncle Carl went to go tell her that, and he called her Nimp. He said, ""Nimp, guess what?"" In real life he doesn't; he calls her Maggie or something like that. And just about that time I woke up."
"C-238"	"#C-238 (2005-04-18 (20)) Man, where are the days going? They're just moving by. Before I know it, I'm going to be graduating, and I'm going to be kind of sad about leaving this place. Well, no, I'll be sad about leaving Modern Media College because I'm enjoying it here so much, but I'll be so happy to leave ______. I might stay in this place if I find a job or an internship around here. I kind of like this apartment complex. But anyway, that's beside the point. This morning I was having little dreams that I was naked in here and I was walking around and that I had my door open and Jill's parents were cooking some food out in the kitchen. Jill came in here, she was wearing all black, which she never does, and she came in here and she started digging through my stuff in the closet. And she said she was, she didn't say it, but I had the notion that she was looking for something of hers, and she was digging and digging through a couple piles of stuff, and then she left. And I decided okay, it was time to get dressed, and I got dressed, and she came back and she started digging through stuff on my desk. And I was pretty upset, but I didn't say anything. Then I looked on my wall, and I realized that I only had three pictures and there were maybe 20 that Jill had in here. And I don't know, that was just crazy. And I dreamt that I had a little ______ from Astrid, that she sent me, and I was going to write to her and tell her thank you. And that's about it."
"C-239"	"#C-239 (2005-04-21 (20)) I was back in Westport again and that we were walking with Sandra. She had come to town. And apparently it was one of those things where she got home from the airport and she rented a car to get to our place. And she didn't do that much unpacking; she just put her bags down and we went for a walk. And she had some shoes that she couldn't walk in very well, and we didn't get too far. Then I had the notion that Mom and Dad were having some kind of a tiff and were trying to hide it from Sandra, as usual. And apparently Sandra kind of thought she wanted to go to a nice _____ shop, but she realized she wasn't going to get that far in those shoes of hers, so we turned around and I'm trying to think, there was something else to this whole thing. I can't remember what it was though. And then it seemed that I flipped to this other scene where I was in the living room there in Westport and my computer was set up on the roll top desk. And I needed to download some Norton updates and I wanted Mom to sit next to me while I did it, so she would get used to what that looked like and realize that none of the operation like that is a big ordeal or a bad thing. And so she pulled up the other chair -- actually in this dream I got up and she moved the big round chair in, and I kind of sat on her lap and I kind of did the navigating because she wanted me to, and she sat with her arm around my shoulder and kind of watched. And I think towards the end something might have screwed up. I think that the updates required me to restart and I couldn't restart for some reason. Something was still running or something got screwed or something. And Mom was like, ""Oh yeah, that always happens,"" because it seems like for her nothing ever goes right. And then I woke up."
"C-240"	"#C-240 (2005-04-23 (20)) It was Christmas time back in Westport and we had our choo-choo train set up around the Christmas tree like we do. And on the way it really is, I honestly don't remember what color it is, but it just goes around the track and goes, ""clackety-clack, ding ding ding ding."" Well, this one in my dream, there were three cars just like the real one, but in my dream all three of them were red and all three of them had flashing lights on them. And the thing with this train is, just like the real one, in order to start it and stop it, you had to flip a switch on the side of the engine, and in order to stop it or something, you had to do it while it was moving, so it was an act of catching it. But there was this other little thingy on the engine that would have like 20 or 30 different patch sounds saved, just like on a keyboard in M___ or something, except these were patch sounds of combinations of train sounds like a train would make while it's going down the track. And there was a certain patch that would make it go, ""Beep beep beep"" as it was going forward, but when you'd make it go backwards, it would be the scary back-up alarm sound like, ""Doo do, doo do,"" and I knew in this dream it did that a few times and I was a little scared, but I wasn't terrified. And in the caboose -- in the real one there's a little compartment where you can put candy and stuff, but in my dream we put three chocolate bunnies in there, like about 3"" high, hollow ones, and we stuck them in there and they rode in there like passengers. And we were getting ready to go somewhere and I wanted to grab a chocolate bunny, and I reached down under the tree and I grabbed it, and somehow the thing turned on and started going backwards and making that sound. And then I woke up."
"C-241"	"#C-241 (2005-04-24 (20)) First of all, I dreamt that it was kind of like the middle of summer and I sort of had the notion that I had graduated from Modern Media College, but then again other aspects seemed to indicate that I was back in high school. So I really don't know where I was. And I had the keyboard set up on TV trays in the bedroom because Mom had handed me a piece of sheet music and wanted me to sight read it. She was sitting down on the floor and she found this page under the bed, and it was all full of dust. I don't even remember what song it was, but I was all set to go, I had it in my hands and I was ready to go. And Dad came home. [laugh] And he was going to come in the bedroom and read or something or do his taxes I think. And I was going, ""Ahhhhhhhhh,"" but I tried to stay calm and I said, ""Could you please go outside? I have to do something yet."" And he went outside, yet he seemed to know all along what was going on. He seemed to know that I had something up my sleeve and all, and the thing had turned a greenish color while all that was going on, a light yellowish green and still kind of shiny. I don't know; that was messed up, man. And then I don't remember what happened. I think I quick shoved it under the bed or something."
"C-242"	"#C-242 (2005-04-24 (20)) I could walk from home to my high school somehow, or maybe not. Maybe I was even back at Bancroft Middle School, but I could walk to school. But I had the option to take the bus home if I wanted. And I had to deposit some money in the Mercantile Bank. I don't remember why, but the one day I didn't make it over there because class let out before they were still open, after it had closed, I guess, I couldn't get in. And the next day I was going to try and get over there. You know how we had a situation where our car battery was kind of weak, and for a while there we thought it was because the radio, like the digital tuner, had to draw memory supply of power with the yellow layer that was a very, very little amount? Well, get this! In this dream Dad wanted me to write a letter to the Mercantile Bank asking if they knew anything about why that would happen. And he was showing me a schematic of the machine and all its IC's and its bank of capacitors and this and that and the other. And then I woke up."
"C-243"	"#C-243 (2005-04-25 (20)) I was staying in a hotel room with Jill and I don't know if it was a hotel room or if it was an apartment that I was just staying and renting for a week. But we were there and I was going to do some kind of live sound gig thing and she was going to do some kind of business thing. And we were in this strange city that I'd never been in before, and I had the notion that we were kind of connected with a big group of people, but we just had this place to ourselves and the other people were going to catch up with us later. Each of us had all of our stuff. This was like a little pit stop that we made after graduation, before we moved back to where we were going to move back to. So here we are in this place. I think it was, I think it was a three-story place. Well yeah, it was a three-story place, but the rooms were tiny. The second story was nothing; it was just bleah. And the third story looked like Grammy's attic. Man, I haven't thought about that place for a while. And the first story kind of looked like our place here in Cedar Park. The second story was just an interim hallyway thing. So each of us had all of our stuff. I had all of my furniture and all of my sound equipment and all kinds of stuff, and so did she. And we were packing everything up in a trailer and I was going back to -- I can't remember if I was going back to Westport or if I was going over to Cedar Park here. But I was going to one of those places. The mixer and keyboard I had left at this place that we were staying at, in one of their little closets. I was so like stunned and shocked and disappointed that I left these things there, these really important things. I called the place right back and I said, ""Did you find these things there?"" and they said, ""Yes, we did,"" and they were going to send them to me UPS. Well, they sent me this really big UPS box, but instead of those things that I had left, they sent me like tons of like soaps and candles and hair brushes and mirrors and all these things that I kind of had the notion that were mine, that I had also left there, that I didn't even know I left there. But I was really worried because I wasn't going to get those really important things back, I don't think. And then I woke up, and I was so, oh, I was so relieved."
"C-244"	"#C-244 (2005-04-26 (20)) I had an off-the-wall dream last night, and I didn't remember it until I was in the middle of class today. Isn't that funny? I think somebody said something or did something and it just all came back to me. I dreamt that I was back at Westport High School taking PE with Mrs. Swenson again, and she was a real cool, relaxed, laid back kind of person. Well, both of them were -- Mr. Jameson was mean to everybody else but nice to me for some reason, maybe because I was nice to him from the start. I don't know. But I dreamt that I was back with Mrs. Swenson and there was a gate at the back of the tennis court leading to the track that was one of those crazy emergency exit doors with the stupid alarm things, except the alarm wasn't just at the door; it triggered the whole fire alarm system for the whole school. And there were two of these doors, one at each end of the tennis court. These things had sound things on the fence that were really loud, and the one was loud. It was, I think somebody said it was like 100 db, and the other one was like 130 db. And, let me think, so the school was going to have a fire drill. I think they had to do it like twice a month instead of just once a month like standard is for Pen______ County Schools, but they couldn't just do it once [laugh] , they had to do it one time when they opened the one door and another time when they opened the other door, so they had to do it twice, one hour apart. And so instead of going to the panel in the office and making the alarm go off, they just opened that door, and Mrs. Swenson had to have us doing jumping jacks as we walked through that door to out to the track where we were supposed to stand until they gave us the all-clear. We were supposed to either do jumping jacks or _______ lift things or twist or arm circles or some kind of aerobic exercise as we were marching out that door. And it was really tough because I'm an audio engineer and going right past all that loud business is not good. So Mrs. Swenson gave me two huge mike pop filter-like type things, one to put on each side of my head, kind of to cover over my ears, but more like on top of my head, sort of like. And she said they would filter out most of the high frequencies as well as cut the volume considerably, because -- according to her in my dream -- the high frequencies pierced through the air the most and wrecked your hearing the fastest. And I think some of this came from the Rupert Meade (?) tape that we saw about a fundamental sound with harmonics, and I started thinking about that terrible, awful alarm in the Westport High School Building 3 and how it's got that kind of buzzy harmonic thing going on in it, and I think that might be where this came from. So I put these things on the sides of my head and they opened the door, and it really did cut down on the volume and I did jumping jacks out that door, just like everybody else did. And then I woke up."
"C-245"	"#C-245 (2006-02-25 (20)) Wow, I thought I was through with the tape thing, but I guess I'm not. We'll see. Last night I had a dream that I was taking classes again at Westport High School, but that I had definitely made up my mind that I wanted to major in Music, and I wanted to minor in Education, I think, something like that. But I was already going for this degree while I was a magical aerospace engineer, and what that means is pretty much a fancy term for studying illusions and stuff. I was studying to be a magician, and I knew that was going to be like a nothing degree. And when Westport College has you seeking a degree from them, they give you this little pink plastic case with these red laminated cards in it telling people what you are. And I opened my pink case and I had three cards in it that said, ""Jasmine Henderson, Illusionary Aerospace Engineer."" And I just thought that was so ridiculous, and I wanted to change my major and I wanted to know if that was possible. And so I was looking through the brochure for the number for Guidance. There were phone numbers for principals and teachers and all kinds of offices, but no phone number for Guidance or Admissions or General Information. I couldn't find any of those numbers, and I think kind of stuck and lost. And that was really all there was to it. I woke up."
"C-246"	"#C-246 (2006-03-02 (20)) I was still living with Jill. We were in this house that was sort of a combination of your typical modern house, our house and my apartment, and our families were there. And Jill and I really got on each other's nerves, but our families seemed to not mind each other at all. The scene that I can remember is that I was in the bathtub washing up my feet and stuff, and I was totally naked, and Jill wanted to use the bathtub when I was done. And I asked her, ""Do you want me to let the water out of the tub and put new water in for you, or do you want to wash in the same water as me?"" And she's like, ""Oh, Jasmine, nobody washes in any kind of water that anybody else washed in."" So I figured, okay, so I let the water out and there were a whole bunch of people in the bathroom watching me. And I swished it down the drain with my feet, and Mom carried me, wrapped me in a towel, and she carried me right from the bathroom right out to her bike. And I was wrapped in a towel, and Dad had his bike. And Mom rode me in the basket of her bike, just like we used to, and they said, ""We've got a surprise for you."" And I'm like, ""Well, you can't take me anywhere if I'm not dressed."" But we were riding down the street and we came to this place that was called Discovery Track. It really sounds familiar, but I'm not really sure if it's a real place or not. We got off the bike, and I was dragging some kind of a cart behind me for a minute, and we were walking along this narrow brick road thing, and everywhere we looked there were model classic cars. There was an old fire truck, a really old white pick-up truck, a couple of Corvettes, some black car with the booshy front, around in front, and there was a twin of our car, and there were two Cadillacs parked in a garage, and there was also like a, oh, I don't know, a spinning ride thing off in the corner. And I got the feeling that this whole thing was like an amusement park ride, where you would sit in one of these old cars and somebody else would drive it or it would drive itself kind of around and around and around this race track. And you'd get a little ride and you'd say, ""Oh whoopee, I rode in an old car,"" and then you'd get out. [laugh] Look, I had a feeling there was going to be something more to it for me because I was special, and so they were taking me off to see this little movie in a little garage-like type thing, and then I woke up."
"C-247"	"#C-247 (2006-03-13 (20)) Okay, let's see. Yeah, it's March 13, 2006. I started taking all of these massive tapes -- I have like a whole box full of these tapes in my closet, and I started taking them one by one, recording them to Cool Edit Pro, editing a few ""ums"" here and there, giving it some more amplitude gain to just kick it in the butt, and then saving it as an mp3 file and meticulously, methodically giving it a very specific file name like the date plus something else. And so when I go to start this tape, I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay, what did I leave off on? What file name did I give my last one?"" Oh no, I'm not supposed to be doing that, I'm supposed to be saying what today's date is. Well anyway, that was a waste of tape. I had a dream last night that there was some kind of tiff going on with Mom and Dad and Mom was going to take me to some place to kind of get out of the house, and she said it was a surprise. And we walked and we walked to this place that sort of looked like a pizzeria called Langman and Dingeys (?) that we used to go to a lot on 4th Street, but it's since closed. And we were having Coke and these little potato chicken nugget things, and we were going down the line getting them off this buffet. And then the scene shifted and I was leaving this pizzeria without Mom, and I crossed the street, I jay-walked like we do. And I went into this museum. I can't remember if I had a cane or not, but I don't think I did. And I was looking for something in particular in there, but I had a feeling there was going to be this class in there about some kind of history or something. And this boy -- probably about 16 or 17 -- I don't know his name, but he was real nice -- he was going to be a student in this class too, and he was asking me to sit in on this class. And I said, ""Yeah, sure, I will."" And so he took my arm, he didn't give me his, but he sort of grabbed my upper arm like Mom does when she's crossing me across the street or something, and started leading me down this hallway. It was a white, it started off with carpet on the floor, but then it was white. And it was this little incline. It sort of went up and then it went down, and there were all these little offices to our left and to our right, and I was looking in windows and I saw these flat surfaces in there and I said, ""Are those mixing consoles or just office desks?"" And he said, ""There are both in there."" And I was like, ""Wowee!"" And by this time an instructor, probably in his 40's and I think two other boys and three other girls, joined us and we were all going to this little room that was going to have this class. And we finally got there, and it's this small, stuffy little room with a table and a bunch of cleaning supplies and stuff next to it. It kind of reminded me of the room at Oceanside Elementary's library where Ms. Garland and I used to work with the CC TV and stuff when she would see me. And I was thinking back to the library room at Oceanside Elementary and how they had a fire extinguisher on the wall that I thought was really an alarm or something, and they had one of these weird exit doors, which this room in my dream did, except this room in my dream had a double door like Westport High School's Media Center did. And the instructor sat us down at the table and said, ""Okay, we need to do a fire alarm because it's in my curriculum and I have to do it once a month."" Now why I keep having bad dreams about schools and fire drills is beyond me. I think that's like long past, that's like water under the bridge. I don't know why I keep having dreams about that, but anyway he just opened the door matter-of-factly. He opened both doors actually and put the stopper things down, and an alarm sounded, but only a few of them sounded, far off in the distance, you know how that goes? And so I was like, ""Okay, this is not too bad of a deal,"" and we all walked out and we all went to this bus lane thing, you know how we always do. And we came back in through the front door when it was all over, and we walked down a little hallway ramp thing all together, past the offices, into this little room thing. And he said, ""Sorry, folks, but I have to do it again."" [laugh] And he said, he was saying that somebody had redone the wiring because apparently before one of the alarm boxes was very unreliable and it would just set off the alarm system if anybody just breathed wrong. [laugh] And he said that he wanted this history class to be an exciting and interesting thing, but some of the students were afraid and unwilling to go in this room because of that factor. And so he had them redo the wiring, and apparently we had to do this again to make sure that the wiring was kosher and all. So this time he opened both doors matter-of-factly again. Oh man, it was horrible. So we ran out of the room and we went to the middle of this bus lane like you have to do, then we went back in the front way and we were going into the room again, and we said, ""Okay, now we can sit down and have our little class."" And then I woke up."
"C-248"	"#C-248 (2006-03-14 (20)) Mom and Aunt Christine were in our kitchen here at home, and Mom was putting a CD in her little, cheap little CD player thing on the kitchen counter area by the microwave. And Aunt Christine was telling Mom that Allen Toussaint was in a nursing home and some criminal had come in there and chopped off his head. And for whatever reason the people let the body sit there for a year in the nursing home. And whoever it was came back a year later to chop off his hand. And I don't remember what happened with all of that, but I remember seeing this little TV show about the whole ordeal and the criminal was prosecuted. And some -- I think Bruce Springsteen or some band put together this tribute CD for him. They got all kinds of singers and all kinds of people and performers to get together and perform his songs, and they were playing this CD in the kitchen. And this dream Allen Toussaint and Professor Longhair were the same person. [laugh] And so this was the great loss of that persona. I'm trying to think now, I know there was a whole ordeal going on before this. I think it was when Aunt Christine was telling Mom about everybody and their brother who had been murdered last week. That's weird. [laugh] Oh, and I also remember some of us being in the living room and asking Dad about how cops aim when they're going to shoot somebody. I don't know why I was dreaming all this; it's just sort of funny. But let's see, Allen Toussaint covered S________ and I heard that on 89.7 last week. And I went to sleep with a sore wrist, and the neighbor, Cassandra's best friend, Corinne's daughter, Eddie hurt, I mean, Eddie hurt his hand a couple of days ago and it seemed like it was going to be really bad, but it wasn't. And that's all I can think. I don't know what I was thinking."
"C-249"	"#C-249 (2006-03-17 (20)) This is St. Patrick's Day. I had a brief dream last night. Lately I've been doing the same where my body's gearing up for the time change and so I've been waking up at 6:00, going pee, getting a drink of water and then usually I lay back down because I'm just barely navigating and I don't really want to get up when it's still dark. And so in that morning between 6:00 and 7:00 I had a brief dream that Duane and Janelle were out of town, but where they were was at this Festival of Dolls, I think Mom was calling it. And I sort of had a vision as if I was there with them. And in my dream Duane and Janelle plus Cassandra and Courtney and Corinne and Eddie were all like one big happy family, which to me, in my eyes, they are. And it would be really nice if we would all know each other and be friends. But anyway, I had a vision like I was there at this thing of theirs and everywhere I went I was hearing bells going, ""Ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding,"" kind of like that song we do and kind of like how it is. Oh gosh, I can't think how it goes, I think it's C, E, D, G, C, E, D, G -- you know how bells are. And so I was hearing bells and I was in this back yard that was bigger than ours, but looked about the same as ours. And it was dark out and there was a big swing, and I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun. And I was making the swing spin around and twist all around and swing, and just have fun. And Eddie was on another swing, and Mom said, ""Be careful, you're not wearing a bra. You don't want Eddie to see your boobs, do ya?"" And at this party I was like totally naked. [laugh] And I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun, and my boobs were bouncing all over, of course. And then I woke up. I can't remember anything more. [laugh] I know I had some other dreams, but they were kind of boring and I didn't remember them after that morning hour."
"C-250"	"#C-250 (2006-03-19 (20)) It was very close to my birthday and that Samantha, Sandra and Derek and I think Mickie were in town, again too, but this time I think it was only Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and there were an extra friend or two in the house, but none of the spouses. And they were all in our living room kind of sitting around and lazing around like they do. And I think Mom and Dad were somewhere in the house. And I think they were all trying to get a surprise together for me because they were wanting me to go over to the pool and swim at the pool for a while and leave them be at home. And in my dream this pool was located kind of in the same place that Circle Lake is, so it was only a hop and a skip away. Somehow I crossed the street and everything. So I put on my bathing suit, head out the back door, walk down the alley and go over to the pool, and I swim at the pool. And I would come home early and I would do everything I could to be quiet. I would leave the pool gate very carefully, I would sort of walk slowly down the alley and into the back, but Dad would always be working in the garage and he would always see me coming home. So I would come in the house and say hi to everybody and then go back to the pool. So I did that a couple of times, like three times. And the last time I came in, I was pretty sure I saw them wrapping something, or something like that, and then they were going to pile in the car and go somewhere. I'm not sure where; it couldn't have been a restaurant because we had food in the car that we were eating. I had my 7-eleven cup that spills if you just breathe on it the wrong way. I had some kind of food that I was trying to eat and trying not to let it spill. All the girls were in the back, Mom was next to me and Derek was driving, and Dad wasn't around. Whoopee! And Derek was driving well, I mean we were just going on an adventure, having fun, and I woke up before we ever got where we were supposed to go."
"C-251"	"#C-251 (2006-03-21 (20)) The birthday drama is building, and I had a dream to support it last night. I think it started out that Josie and two of her friends were in town and were staying in the room where Samantha and Sandra used to sleep, and the twin beds were still there. And they had this whole thing of jewelry, this whole like store display plaque shelf type thing that was about three feet high with everything under the sun dangling off of it. And they said I could borrow anything I wanted while they were here, and it was at the foot of the bed on this trunk like Sandra had. And so I took off a bracelet that was silver with stars on it, and I went around the house cleaning up various things. And I think I was out in the front yard, and a UPS man came by to deliver something, and he said I was getting a Nord Electro for my birthday. And he took this tall, long box off of his truck, kind of wide, but coming up to my chest level, and it was so heavy, he helped me get it onto the porch. And I was thinking, ""Yahoo! My dream is finally coming true, finally getting something like this for my birthday."" But then it started to get tall and skinny, and it started to kind of shrink, and the box had an open front so that I could look into the box and I could touch the thing. And it was this tall, skinny baby toy-like type thing. It was still bright red, but, I mean, it was nothing like a professional thing that a Nord Electro really is. And I was thinking, ""What?! You mean to tell me this is my present?"" And by that time it was small enough and light enough that I could pick it up and just put the whole thing behind the blue chair in the living room and just pretend that I'd never even seen it. And then the next little scene was brief and fleeting, but I dreamt that I was in Jim's living room and he had a class of maybe ten or twelve, maybe even fifteen other students and me. His living room was a little bigger to accommodate us, and his instruments were spread out a little more. And we were at tables that looked like cafeteria tables, and I was in the very back. Well anyway, I remember he was passing around little worksheets for us and going into detail about explaining theory and stuff, not necessarily having us do anything hands-on. And he was having to stop and get everybody back on track and kind of discipline the talkers and stuff, just like Mr. Hanover would have to do. And after a little bit of that, I woke up. I think that scene came from the fact, flipping through the Thompson's First Grade Book, I see little quizzes and things and little things that are geared toward keeping students on track, and I can see how the unimpassioned student would get bored real fast. But, of course, I see all that as a means to an end."
"C-252"	"#C-252 (2006-03-23 (20)) I was back in Oceanside Elementary and I was going to eat lunch in the cafeteria with a couple of other girls and a boy. And what the thing of it was that part of your grade related to whether you went up to the cafeteria buffet and served other people along with yourself, or whether you just served yourself. And I was in the line and there were only like three people behind me, and there was this boy ahead of me. And they had this kind of yukky turkey and pork fiber that was supposed to be a sandwich, but really wasn't it. And he plopped some of that on my plate and I was thinking, ""I can't serve this to anybody else; there's not enough."" And some of the ladies behind the counter were going to give me more, or put more out for the people, and there were like little containers of fruit and little containers of jello, and I really wanted one but I didn't have enough money. So I took my measly little pork dish up to the cash register and paid for it and the lady wrote on my receipt that I got a 50 because I didn't serve anybody else. And then somewhere alone in this dream I felt like the cafeteria had a subwoofer under the stage and that there was a sound system that they were going to play for us during lunch. And that in a few days the cafeteria was going to be closed for a few weeks so they could remodel and retweak the sound system in some way. And then I was back home upstairs in my bedroom, and I had the feeling that I was still really close to that cafeteria, like it was downstairs in our house, and I wanted to go get something more because I was still hungry in my dream. And then I woke up."
"C-253"	"#C-253 (2006-03-26 (21)) As you can tell, I feel awful today. I don't know what's going on with my body, but Dad was real sick a few days ago and I think he passed it right along to me. But also I don't feel good because I was almost sure that yesterday was going to be my party, and, of course, they didn't have my party yesterday. And so I had two dreams last night. The first dream I have a faint recollection of being in the living room with Mom. Get this: there was still a Christmas tree in there, and there was a coffee table where we put it when we put the Christmas tree. And I was wrapping these dumb little presents for myself with Mom and this paper with roses on it and stuff. There was like a little cheap toy watch and some hair bows and things, and a CD or something that I was wrapping for myself. And Mom had a box about the size of a shoebox that she was wrapping up, that she didn't want me to see. And I felt like it was going to be something a little bit better, but I didn't think it was going to be all that great. And so then we were putting these presents like under the Christmas tree, and still in my dream I didn't know when my party was going to be. And I'm walking around the house doing other things, and I kept checking behind the blue chair to see if maybe there were extra presents back there. And I kept waiting and looking all around the living room for a long box, and I didn't see it and I didn't see it, and I was waiting for this long box to appear. And I was so sure that it would and it didn't. And then I woke up. It was like 5:00 in the morning. I think I went pee or something and then I went back to sleep. It was freezing cold. This is going to be the coldest birthday I've ever had. And I dreamt that I was riding the bike with Mom in the dark and I had no pants on. And we go into this restaurant, like a pizzeria. It looks like CC's Pizza, like we went to before my job interview. And we were walking around and I had no pants on and I was real self-conscious and there were all these girls all around. And then I realized that this was going to be strip joints and that people were going to think I was a prostitute because I had no pants on. And then I think we rode around town a little bit more. Mom had some other place she wanted to take me. Oh, I knew there was some more to this. I think there was this really strange book on the dining room table with a red cover. And it was about musical instruments. It wasn't about the art of being a slut or anything. But somehow I had the notion that it was this really weird book about instruments that sane people wouldn't want to read. And then I woke up."
"C-254"	"#C-254 (2006-03-28 (21)) It's the day before my birthday, man, and I'm feeling a whole lot better. Thank goodness! I don't know what hit me the other day. But last night I had kind of a stupid dream, but I think it makes a little bit of sense. I dreamt that Mom and I were in the park, laying on a blanket, and it was kind of cloudy in the sky, but not really going to rain or anything. And she was having a look across the lake with my distance _______ to see somebody over there that was going to be water skiing. And get this: my distance _______ had this flat plastic boggling (?) figure of Goofy on it dangling from the lanyard thing on an extra string, and Mom said that that was supposed to indicate the reference point of where the ground level was. Now what that has to do with anything, I don't know. But I looked across the lake and I saw the water skier, and he water-skied by and I was thinking, ""Okay, so what?"" So a little while later Terri showed up. She brought with her a schedule for me because I was starting high school the next day, except it didn't look like the little sheet of paper that Westport High School used to give me every year. It was a full sheet of paper like I get from Modern Media College like I print out from their web site. And it was formatted just like they did. So I was going to go to Westport High School again. I only had to go to two or three classes a day, but I had to get up at like 6:00 in the morning to be at school by 7:00, and I was thinking to myself, ""Oh gosh, ______ are going to kill me; I hate doing this."" And then the scene shifted and I was at an art show with Mom. And I was helping her pack stuff up. We were folding chairs and loading stuff in the truck. And Courtney and Haley were there. And then I woke up. Now, as you probably know, Haley just moved down here and she's enrolling in Southwest High School, so that's probably where that came from. And, oh, let's see what else. Mom has an art show coming this Saturday, so I think that's where that came from. This is just rather dumb, I think."
"C-255"	"#C-255 (2006-04-04 (21)) We were at a stadium watching the Super Bowl in another city. From their like big screen-like type thing. We were in a VIP box, and so we brought our receiver and a few things to do the audio support. And somewhere in this plot I was heading for Centerville the next day, and I was getting calls from Frieda Thurston and Laura from my bus, and people I used to know, Marilyn and Noelle and I think Samantha. Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there too again. And what a lot of this line I was thinking about how I am going to Centerville, but I have no clue what I'm going to do over there. I'm not going back to Modern Media College. I'm not even going to have a job in the audio industry. I'm going to leave Duane and Janelle. I'm going to get up and move, but what am I going to do when I get over there? So I was letting that thought go through my mind, and, you know, the Super Bowl and all this starting and this and that, and then the audio was kind of low because I was on the phone. And in this VIP box we had a Christmas tree and a couple of little Christmas village things underneath it, I guess because it was that time of year, right after Christmas. And so Mom was talking a little about putting in the CD ______ and I said I would do it in a few minutes. And so, get this: in the back of the VIP box across the hall there was this gift shop with fancy bowls and fancy cups full of glitter that they were selling. Everybody's sound equipment was staged in there and wired up so that it could work. And I asked Mom to turn up the volume on our receiver because Eva Cassidy was starting to sing ""Imagine."" And she went in the gift shop, but instead of turning up the volume, she changed the input selection. And then she was all confused and I said, ""________ they were the gift shop."" Anyway, I came through the door of the gift shop and I asked Mom, ""Where is our receiver? I don't know where it is. If you show me where it is, I'll take care of it."" So she does like she does when I'm trying to find something in the refrigerator. She leads me to the general area, she says, ""It's in the middle,"" and then she runs away. And I'm looking around this little area she pointed me to, there's lots of glittery bowls and cups that are plastic, there's somebody else's receiver, there's a bunch of t-shirts and stuff, but I can't find ours. And it's like that was very frustrating. "
"C-256"	"#C-256 (2006-04-05 (21)) It's late at night again. I am a bad procrastinator. Last night I had a dream, a really, really weird dream, that I was back at Westport High School again, I was in the Little Theater, the small theater where Mrs. Dougherty and her chorus used to rehearse, and there was a big acoustic grand piano on stage with a dark finish. But it had this electrical switch wired to the wooden ledge above the keys, and the reason why this existed like this is so that the performer could sit on stage and warm up and get ready to perform, and then he wouldn't have to get up for anything. He could just flip this switch on the ledge there and the curtains would open and the lights would dim and he wouldn't have to move. And he could just address his audience. But the only thing was that something weird, something wasn't wired right with this wiring, and so instead of the curtains opening and the lights dimming, the fire alarm would go off. And so the theater is kind of empty when I'm in there and it's starting to fill up gradually and I'm waiting for this concert and I'm really getting excited about this concert that they're going to do. And I was with a girl, a friend named Alicia, and she was sitting a few rows back and I got to see her when she was a year younger than me. I was still in high school, I guess, in this dream. And then I heard the people in neighboring seats chattering to me about how this wiring might not be so great anyway, and so it's time for him to perform, it's time for the pianist to come out and perform. And I'm like so afraid because of this, because I think the alarm is going to sound when he wants to dim the lights or something. And so, sure enough, that's what happened, but I didn't hear any alarm sounds in the Little Theater. It was like outside, outside in the hallways. But I'm so afraid that I'm yelling for Alicia to come. And I got up and I ran down the aisle and Alicia ran after me and we ran outside before the rest of the school alarms went off. Now I wonder where in the world all of this is coming from. I think the part about being back at Westport High School and stuff is the fact that I've been going through and putting all of my other dreams into mp3 files and Audio Audition, and, you know, I've been hearing my voice evolve sort of, and, you know, I've had lots of dreams about Westport High School and fire drills and stuff, and I think that might just be coming back to me. And, of course, Jim had me practice on his big acoustic one yesterday, so I had that exposure. But I can't help thinking there's a little more to do this, and it's sad. But that's the gist of it."
"C-257"	"#C-257 (2006-04-07 (21)) Merrilee was joining the United Nations ________ Center, and I think Merrilee turned into Cassandra later in this dream, but one of the ladies convinced Mom that I should join too, and they were going to this major convention at this hotel. And somehow I got separated from Mom and that neighbor, and I'm wandering around and I'm wandering around, and there's this big lobby with lots of stairs and lots of little side rooms and lots of people milling around. Everybody spoke English, but there were a lot of ethnic accents. And they were going to have this big banquet and the end goal of the whole dream was to get to the big banquet and meet up with Mom and Cassandra. So I went to the registration desk and I showed them my ID, and they said, ""Who did you come with?"" and I said, ""Maggie Henderson."" And they looked in their data base and they said, ""Oh yes, we have you."" And they gave me four choices of ______ to pay _____: fifty, twenty-five, fifteen or ten. So, of course, I paid the $10 because I didn't know what it was for. And then I went down this little hall, thinking I might find the banquet hall. And there was this room. By this time I met up with this lady who was helping kind of guide me along, and she was big and fat and a little rough, but she was kind and she sort of grabbed me by the arm and we were like walking around. She told me there was this private party going on in that room and I could hear an Irish jig going on. And then we went up a little couple of stairs and through a back hallway and go to this banquet hall that looked more like a restaurant. It had square wooden tables and we were sitting in wooden chairs. And there were no table cloths or anything on these tables, and Mom and Cassandra were sitting at a regular table, and they put Courtney and me at a little kids' table across the way. And it turns out that Mom and Cassandra and Courtney and everybody were getting fish fillets and vegetables, and all I got was a little piece of bread and half a cup of Shirley Temple in a Styrofoam cup. And I had only paid $10 to register, I was a junior member. And so then I woke up."
"C-258"	"#C-258 (2006-04-08 (21)) Apparently I was coming home from Jackson and I had ordered some kind of book online. And for some reason they shipped a live puppy with the book and I kept thinking, ""What in the world am I going to do with this puppy?"" It arrived at home while we were in Jackson for another week. And somebody up in Jackson had a green bird that was dying. I think it was Aunt Christine. And Cassandra's Eloise was dead because she was sick or something, and it seemed so real. Everybody over there was so sad, and I was too. And this puppy that was supposed to have come with the book was alive barely, and I was giving her sugary cereal to eat until we get her some other food. Oh, what else? I know there was a lot more to do. Oh, and I think my birdie had just died too, as he really did a week or two ago, and we were wondering what to do with him and stuff. And that's about it, all about being dream, was this dream."

I notice that I'm also starting to write in my journal less and less, and I really have no excuse because I don't have a job yet. I'm just surfing the net all the time, either that or I'm just practicing. Anyway, last night I had kind of a vague dream that there was a man with two big dogs in front of Pete's house. They were totally black on top and their legs and their stomachs and their faces were tan. And they were growling at me. And one came real close to taking a big bite out of my chin. And the guy said that -- I can't remember what we did to calm him down, but the guy said that there was a trick to it, that I think they didn't mean any harm, but they were just hungry or something dumb like that. But I think the one actually did bite me after a while, and I was running away, trying to get away from him, and I ran down the alley into our back yard and Eloise showed up. And apparently she needed something too. She needed a new collar or something, and I got the feeling like she was thirsty. And she came up and just laid on my shoulder and kind of licked me, like she does to Cassandra. And I thought that was sweet, and I held her and petted her, and then I sort of woke up. And let's see, last night I had a dream that I was back at Westport High School, but that I was staying with Jill and this other girl she knew. I think this other girl was acting kind of like Courtney and Susan into one person. And Rianne ditched me for a roommate and this other girl took her place, that used to room with Jill, I guess. And so Jill had somebody else that was with her that was rooming with her. [laugh] Well, we were out in the bus circle at Bancroft Middle School, but the inside looked like Westport High School. And Jill knocked me down on the ground and took off my clothes, so I was running around buck naked. And I was wearing a really pretty orange dress, and Jill just knocked me down and took it off off me. And she put it on. And she was walking around school in this orange dress that was mine, and I was walking around naked. [laugh] And we were doing into this auditorium, I thought, and I had the feeling like it was okay to go to class naked, but it wasn't going to be okay to go to this party naked that we were going to go to. And so we're sitting in this auditorium waiting for this concert or play to begin, and we're right in the front row. And I'm naked and Jill is in my pretty orange dress, and the other two girls were in sloppy clothes. And then I woke up. [laugh] That was funny."
"C-260"	"#C-260 (2006-04-20 (21)) I was in some kind of grassy, open space. I felt like it was near my school, but I kind of felt like it was in my old apartment complex from Weir (?) Park and I was sitting there on a picnic blanket with a boyfriend that I had. I'm not sure who it was. It could have been Sean or Justin, or it could have been a younger version of Jim. And he was talking about Andrea Bocelli and how he had apparently started a charity and he was helping manage Andrea Bocelli's charity. And he was putting all kind of money in it, all kinds of jobs and donations and stuff. And we started talking about getting a drink of water, and Jill comes by and she's talking to us a little bit about different things about school, and then this boy says, ""I'm going to go in and get some water. I'm going to get some ice from the ice box in your refrigerator, okay?"" And I say, ""Okay, that's fine,"" and Jill goes, ""Oh no, I took a lot of time to fill up that ice tray, and I just don't feel it's right for somebody else to go in and get my ice."" And they kind of argued a little about it, and in the end it turned out that he was going to take some of the Andrea Bocelli money to go buy his own ice. And then I woke up."
"C-261"	"#C-261 (2006-04-29 (21)) I had a lot of catching up to do, and I cannot believe how much I just whizzed through this tape. I must be the master at wasting it. Well, anyway, last night I had a dream that I was watching Celine Dion on DVD for some reason again. I hadn't dreamt about Celine for a long time, and then she showed up again last night. I can't remember what she was singing, but I know she was singing something that I didn't know. I had the feeling like she might have sung two or three songs that I almost knew and then some that I just didn't. And she was in a red outfit, but it was more conservative than the one she wears for the Las Vegas show. And I don't remember what the other outfit was; I think the other one was all black. And it was supposed to be the Las Vegas show, I think, but there was this grayish background, and I think that was just sort of a transient dream that just sort of happened. Oh, and earlier this week I had a long epic dream with many dumb, little scenes in it, and I don't remember any of them now, of course. But one of the scenes I do remember was that Mom and I were at the Oceanside Park, the place where you go before you come to the beach. And she was riding her bike and I was walking, and I had the feeling like we were coming home from the pier, because we had just been there. And I was ahead of her, and she was riding her bike trying to catch up to me. And I decided I was going to walk back to her on the bike, I mean walk back to her and her bike, and so that I could walk alongside her and talk and stuff like that. So I'm going back to her and all of a sudden a couple of sprinklers turn on and they're spraying right at the sidewalk like the ones at Modern Media College used to do. And I decided, ""Whoops -- I don't think I could go that way."" And I was really afraid of these sprinklers in my dream. And so I turned around and kept going my own way, and I was going along my own way and going along and saying, ""Okay, she's just going to have to go through the sprinklers and get wet."" And so I'm a ways down the road, and then all of a sudden all the sprinklers turn on and they're all spraying right at the sidewalk and they're in the grass too. There's more in the grass spraying all over the grass. So it's sprinkle city as far as I can see, and this park as far as I can see, which probably isn't that far. But anyway, I'm standing there surrounded by sprinklers, getting soaking wet, and yelling for help, except I can't really yell. You know how it is in a dream. And then I find a little place where there's an intersection of a sidewalk where I can stand right in the middle of the intersection and not get too wet, but I'm still surrounded by all these sprinklers and I'm scared to death for whatever reason it is. And eventually Mom comes on the bike and her big back basket is as big as her front basket, and she puts me in her back basket and rides off, and I'm not getting wet any more once I'm on the bike, and I'm not even really afraid of the sprinklers any more. And then I faded into some other stupid thing. I thought this was just something dumb that occurred in my mind, but when I told Mom about it, she said that the sprinklers represent the circumstances of my life right now, I think, because I feel like I'm being surrounded and sort of led astray to some degree by going back to school, and I'm being kind of wrestled down and -- what should I say? -- closed in and trapped by all of that stuff. And I kind of tend to agree, I think. And, you know, she always tries to rescue me from bad emotional situations. So I guess that's what that is."
"D-001"	"#D-001 (2010-05-13 (25)) One thing ____________ Derek gave me a p______ ____book that was kind of small, about the size of a planner, somebody's like planner book, and it was in a ring binder like a planner book would be, but it had a rubber jacket cover on it and it had this pocket on the inside, and it had a really fancy pen with it. You know how sometimes you get a pen that's super business-like and super fancy? Well, this one was like that, and apparently he got a pen with it so that he could mark on the ______ about important financial ______ what to do and the arrangement based on how you produce them and how you created your income from that __________________ sheet. And another thing that was really cool and really significant and I was going to keep it -- I don't remember if it was something that he knew, that he had, or whether it was something that he found for me and gave me because he thought that I would like. But I remember that it was, I don't know -- I mean that was all there was to it."
"D-002"	"#D-002 (2010-05-14 (25)) I'm doing this in the evening, which is a little backwards. I should have done this in the morning, but I was just too groggy so it wasn't an option. And then I was busy, busy, busy, busy all day. So last night I finally had a dream that I remember in some detail. I've been having some pretty colorful dreams lately, but when I wake up, I just feel that either a) I can't remember half of what happened, or b) it was too stupid to really take note of. And when I say that, I mean that it was just too boring and nothing really interesting or weird or mind-catching or anything. So this one is kind of a little uninteresting, but at least I remember some details. There were like two parts to it. First Mom and I were riding on the book to the waterfront, kind of along the way that I walk, except we were going a lot further to the beach or the ____ plant, which you can do on a bike. And it was supposed to be a her and me thing, and we were going to bring a boombox and we were going to have a lot of fun, and we were going to go by and get some fried chicken or something and just have a party. And we were going to swim and something like that. But Dad came along, and it was still sort of okay, but we couldn't do a lot of the things that we planned to do and it was just sort of kind of like medium fun, or low-medium fun. And it was okay, and we were all pretending, you know, like we usually do, playing our usual head games like we usually do. And at some point, actually the way this unfolded, Mom and I were riding our bikes first and Dad caught up with us once we reached the waterfront. But before we reached the waterfront, we were going across 4th Street and just as we were entering the intersection, a fire truck and an ambulance and two other things went by and they had their loud sirens going, and I took my hands off the handlebars and covered my ears, and Mom turned the bike around and tried to ride away as fast as she could. We still couldn't get too far away from them, but it was just kind of a little bit of a scare. And then we went across 4th Street and then we met up with Dad and we were having our picnic, and next thing I know, we were with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and we were all sitting around talking about things we want to do, and we were at the Green ______. And we were supposed to go to the mall and it was already afternoon, and we were supposed to go to the mall in the evening time. And again, I thought it would be a whole lot more fun if it was just Mom and the kids and I. And, but Dad came along, or he was going to come along, and I was thinking, ""Oh boy, this is not going to be fun."" I mean, it's just like how are we going to shop and go to the mall and stuff with him tagging along and wanting us to hurry up and stuff like that? And so before I woke up, we were all piling into the car, and I was wrapping up the blanket and I was packing up stuff, and there was this dog that we were trying to corral and get to come with us. And then I woke up."
"D-003"	"#D-003 (2010-05-16 (25)) I was at this big building that was like a hotel or something. And I was going around looking for _________________ something, and I was with some other people my own age. And I went up and down the elevator a few times, and then I realized that in order to make the elevator work, you had to put in a dollar bill and a coin, like $1.50 or something. And I needed more change and I was kind of worried and I was hoping I was on the right floor. Oh, and another thing, when this elevator would go up and down, you would feel a certain amount of pressure and your ears would pop. ________________________. And then finally I met up with __________________ and she helped me find, she was like all excited. She was looking for the meeting room herself. But _______________ going to find ____________________. And she was all dressed up. She had this red vest and this _____ black suit, and she, and when we got to the meeting room, it kind of looked like the Columbia, and all these board members were standing around up there. And then we said hello to them. And then I noticed that there was a piano in the back of the room, and I figured, ""Okay, we'll go sit down at this table here, and when things get really boring and everything's _______ and bleah, I'll get up and go over to it."" And then I woke up."
"D-004"	"#D-004 (2010-05-23 (25)) Well, first of all yesterday I went to __________ ____________________. So in my dream I __________ that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there and we were doing various things. We were walking around the city and I dreamt that there was this place that ____________________, unfortunately a few avenues down from us, kind of like ____ Ice Cream Factory except it looked like a pizza place. And I don't remember what we were calling it, but it _______ it was like a _______. It was like, they're both pizza, of course, and there was this little tiny, tiny, little delicate little merry-go-round that could hold like three toddlers, and it had horses, but they didn't move up and down. And they played theater organ music over the PA system, really quietly in the background. They didn't have a real organ, and they had these red tables and this _____ and everything, and this place was supposed to be really fun and I ___________________. This was nothing compared to __________________________ tiny ____________. I know there was more to it, but I can't remember it now. I just know that _________________ and then walking around with the _______ and ___________. And we were kind of playing around like we used to when I was little. And that's all, I guess."
"D-005"	"#D-005 (2010-05-25 (25)) I was at the house of the Polish people behind us, Catherine and Fritz, and I guess we went over there at the start of the party or something ___________________. And the funny thing was these different people. When we got there it wasn't Fritz and Catherine, it was somebody else, but it was ______________________ house is. And so we got there and there were a bunch of people there and ___________________ and they had a piano in this other side room. It was the one like Erica has. It was like this ____________. And it was like the one that I play at the _______________ where if you didn't turn off the ________ machine thing, it would sound kind of funny. Let's see, how did this even begin? A bunch of people were talking __________ and the main _______________ piano, and I think, there was one of these dreams where I was trying to play and I can't really. And I didn't have the sense of ______ in this dream, so that didn't help. [laugh] But I really wanted to, and it was one of those dreams where I couldn't consciously remember ___________________ I guess. And then I went to this bathroom and some little girl walked in on me, and it wasn't really that big of a deal, but she left the door wide open and she like bouncing from her bedroom back to this bathroom. __________________ And then Mom and Cassandra came in and _______________________. But they stood around talking, you know. Let's see _____________. And then next thing I knew I was standing ______________ at this house and I came to the understanding that _________________________ house and the piano was still there, and I was actually staying in the room with the piano. There was a bed and there was like a crib for these two little girls, and for some reason I couldn't sleep and I got up at like 3:00 in the morning, and it was so strange. I had my CC TV at this house, and I had my little tape machine, and I was in this bedroom where the piano is and ____________ gotten up and I had turned on the CC TV and I was reading _______ stuff ______ or like _______________. And I was listening to _________________ little tape machine. And then ___________________________ _________________. And then the little girl started to cry and she didn't see me _______________. _____________________ and then the most crazy turn of all, I dreamt that it was the next morning and ___________ there with some other lady friend of hers. And I'm trying to think who else was it ____________ having a party, and it was like, you know, like having a little tea party _________________. And I was laying on the floor for some reason in the other room and ______ was showing her lady friend all of the American Organist magazines. And then the last thing before, the last thing in this dream is __________. She was trying to get this room air conditioner to work because she was hot, and it was kind of like the one we have in the bedroom. And she turned it on high and I guess she thought it was _______________ thing. And somehow she was able to make it sound like it was going, ""Boom, boom"" like she was stepping on the gas pedal of a car or something. And she said, ""______, I'm hot, I need air!"" And then I figured it was time for me to go because I was freezing and she was still wanting the air to be colder, as it usually goes in those places, mostly in big buildings at the college and _______________________ freezing my buns off. And so then I realized I need to ____________ some stuff and go home. And I was able to unplug the CC TV to carry it across the alley and through the back yard and back home and put it back in place. And then I was making somebody a cake, and what I was going to do was I was going to cut one of those______ like in half and then put a gold like __________ so that it looked like a basket. And I was going to write something on it. And I can't remember who it was for, but it was somebody's birthday. And I guess that's all there was to it. Boy, that was a long dream. It was all these different things in the same house. I wish I could have gotten to play the piano, though."
"D-006"	"#D-006 (2010-06-06 (25)) The first one was that Mom and Dad and I were taking one of our long road trips, and it wasn't too long because it was in the state, but still up to the capital, I consider that long. But where my dream started was that we were in this big bed and breakfast type place. It was kind of sort of like a hotel, just ____________________ people can stay. But it had ____________ rooms with nice, homey furniture like a bed and breakfast. And our whole family was staying there. There was Mom and Dad and I and there was, I had the feeling that Uncle Carl was there and Diana and we were all gathering there to _____________________ ______________________. And this is like a stop-off point for us before we actually meet up with her. And in this dream it was kind of nice because I had my own like _____ bedroom type room. It was almost like a suite. I had like a big bedroom, _____ bathroom, and I could shut the door, and it was totally separate from Mom and Dad's space because usually whenever we go on a trip __________ or we go to somebody's house and we end up staying, I have to ___________ Mom and Dad, and, you know, I don't have any real issues or anything when it's just _____________ sleeping with both of them because, you know, I feel like I can't move, I can't, you know, do anything without being noticed. And here I felt really comfortable because I was in my own room, I was folding my clothes and I was putting them at the foot of my bed, and I had the radio on and I was brushing my hair and I was generally getting myself together. And I think I just _______________ or shower and I was naked, and I had to go and find Mom and Dad's room because Mom had my really pretty dress that _____________ that I was going to wear. [laugh] And so I opened the door and I'm in this huge like _______ and I'm totally naked, and I think I know which is Mom and Dad's room. And I open the door, and it's not. It's the men's exercise, weight-lifting room. [laugh] But __________ there was no one in there at this time. And then I opened another door that was Mom and Dad's room, and Mom was doing something to my dress, like sewing it or something. And so I had to sit a few minutes to kind of wait for her to finish. And I felt a little bit funny, like maybe something was the matter. You know how some of the little tips turn into big things and some of them are just little things. Well, I felt like one of the little things was going on and I wanted to get back to my room, but I needed my dress. And eventually Mom gave me my dress and I kind of put it on in there so I wouldn't have to walk naked through the foyer again. And then I went back to my room and fiddled around a little bit more. I think I had the radio on again, I was folding clothes again and doing something, packing a bag or something. And then I wanted to see if there was a big TV like on a _______ type of thing. And it must have been on _____________ blasting pictures at me, and I couldn't figure out what it was. But I figured, ""Well, I should find a way to turn this off. What is this doing on? I'm not going to watch it. We're getting ready to go somewhere."" And so I felt around across the top and down the side and I couldn't really find any way to turn it off. So I said, ""Oh well, it's not really hurting anything. I guess I'll just leave it on."" And then the craziest part of all [laugh] . Some lady or girl or somebody that I kind of thought I knew was laying in my bed with a bunny rabbit, a real live bunny rabbit, just sort of cradling it in her arms. And I was petting it and I thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And I was thinking, ""Oh how nice -- she has a pet bunny."" And I don't' remember much more about that. I remember when we were petting the bunny, we were just kind of hanging out waiting to go off. And then I woke up and kind of rolled around a little bit. It was daylight, but I went back to sleep. And during the 7:00 o'clock hour I had a dream that kind of felt weird, like maybe it was a non-REM dream or something. It was just kind of boring and nothing to it. I dreamt that I lived in Penelope's complex, but it wasn't like the real Westminster P_____. In my dream there was a very barren-like gray walls and gray like squarish hallways. It was almost like a prison or something. And it kind of put me to mind of _________'s kind of world, in the hallways that are in it. And I just think, ""Oh, who would want to live here?"" And so I was in a room right next door to Penelope and I was going to Modern Media College at the same time. Talk about mixed up! And I don't even remember what I was doing. I just remember feeling kind of alone and like I had no place to really go and do anything with anybody. And I was just kind of stuck there, like almost in a prison. And then I woke up."
"D-007"	"#D-007 (2010-06-18 (25)) The night before I had a dream that, of all things, I was at the _______ School of Music, but, you see, it was kind of like Westport College in that there were like a wide variety of stuff __________, but the music program was like their crown jewel, if you will. And we were up there and Josie was going there too, and it was graduation time. And I was graduating with my Associate's in just general stuff, like I did at SPC, and Josie was graduating with her Bachelor in Education. And just then I was starting to realize where I was. Josie and I were in this lobby, we were walking around. It was kind of dark and I don't know what we were doing, but we were doing something to kind of prepare for graduation. It wasn't the actual like put on your gown, it wasn't the actual ceremony. It was like some administrative stuff that we were supposed to do when we were to exit the program, if you will, or something. So were in this lobby walking around, and we were sitting down on these benches, and I was realizing that I'm here at this best place in the world really, and I didn't take a single music class. I was just filling up my plate with general stuff. And I felt really, really bad, and I felt bad that I had missed the chance to major in music, and I think that was _______________. And I was thinking what to do, try to get my ____________ going to do for __________. Hopefully I could make that go a little better and at least take a couple of music classes and stuff, even if I couldn't major in it. And then Josie and I were walking around the patio outside and I was still thinking about ________. There was no real dialogue in this dream. It as mostly only one or two things and a whole bunch of thoughts going through my head. But then the next little scene was where I was in ___________ _______________ and I was practicing, I was playing ""Amazing Grace"" and I was thinking how, I was really having a lot of feelings like I didn't have enough time to practice, and how was I going to pull this off? How were we going to pull off this being a good musician thing when I don't have time to practice and I don't feel like I'm getting my stuff down right? And then something happened. I realized that my keyboard was really this odd thing that was built into an office desk. If you can imagine one of those desk blotter calendar things with keys on it, meaning that the white keys were really, really ______ and had like calendar stuff ______ on them, and the black keys were like really, really short. Imagine having to play something like that. And I realized, ""Well, gee, this is something that I was given because I don't really play well enough to have a real keyboard."" And then, as a little more time went along, I realized that it didn't really have keys at all, that I was just imagining it, kind of like I used to do before I even had keyboards, I used to have this kind of thing. And then I woke up, and I was, you know, this dream, when I woke up and I went to my real keyboard and the lift of the keys was normal, and it was the perfect way that your hands fall in a curved position and touch the white and the black keys, I felt so grateful and kind of like I did when I first got it. I'm just rambling on; I can't find the right words here, but it left a whole other feeling in me that it's really a blessing to be able to play, even though I might get frustrated at myself sometimes, and even though I might have issues sometimes. It really is a new day in my life because I'm a musician."
"D-008"	"#D-008 (2010-06-19 (25)) We were in the ____________. When we first went in, it kind of seemed like the Cracker Barrel, but as we were walking around, it kind of turned into a Walmart. Derek was looking for some kind of book that he wanted to give Dad. Dad was generally being a cranky jerk like he can be sometimes. He was looking for like, I don't know, paint or something and Mom was looking for something too, and I was just kind of like bored to death, not sure what to do. And I got the feeling we were not in Westportrsburg. I got the feeling we were like in Centerville or something, although I wasn't going to school. We were doing something, some kind of one of those trips that we used to do of something, and I was looking around and I was seeing these different stuffed bears and things. And I was trying to think to myself how I wish I could just go home. I'm going to think for a minute what else there was to this. I was really angry in this dream because of how Dad was acting. I don't remember anything he actually said, but he was doing that thing where he was taking a kind of a little thing and blowing it out of proportion, where something that was not _____________, he was taking to make Mom feel like she was being selfish just because she wasn't thinking of him like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And, like I said, we were out somewhere in some of the city, and I was thinking how I had the notion my _______ might leave the store and walk somewhere and how long _______ had the car keys, and how I wanted to go home so bad. And I was thinking to myself in this dream, you know, it's like ___________ hard to get home. And then, well, I wasn't really feeling like I could drive in this dream. I was just feeling like if I wished hard enough, I could get the car to go home all by itself kind of a thing. [laugh] But then somehow things changed in this dream. I don't know how it went from a Walmart store to being at a Jungle Park like type place, but it did. Mom and Dad and Derek were still busy diddling in the store, but somehow I found a way to like get outside to this path that was very much like Jungle Park, and I was walking around through these different paths and bushes and things, and just being outside, I felt so much more at peace. And being away from everybody, I felt a lot better. And I heard this harmonica player. I couldn't really tell where he was, but he was on one of the bench pavilion things and he __________________. And I went around again and I came to a flamingo exhibit that, you know, they don't have any more animals any more, but that used to be the fun of going there, to see the animals. And so there were two flamingoes that had flown outside the exhibit, but I could climb on the rocks and I could climb down inside the exhibit to go and see them. And they all came up to me. They were the most tame and gentle birds you could ever know. And I was petting them, and there was this one I picked up, and they were just really tame and they made me feel much better. And then somehow I was back up on the path again and there was a really sweet flamingo _______ just standing there. It wasn't going in the exhibit. [laugh] And then there were these dogs, these little puppy dogs that came along in this park ___________ and kind of scared them. And then I woke up."
"D-009"	"#D-009 (2010-06-23 (25)) Was pretty long and involved. I dreamt that Mom and Dad were home and it was this time of year, the height of summer, all the usual, blah, blah, blah. And we were playing this family picnic in the park, you know. I like being in the outdoors and all, but I'm just at a stage in my life where if I have to have another family picnic, I'm going to scream. [laugh] Well, for some reason I love when Mom and I take picnics and go buy ______ and get a little thing or when we pack something and we go someplace. But just doing the whole family thing is just, if I have to do another family picnic, I'm going to scream. [laugh] So this dream was, it was like, you know, we were supposed to celebrate Father's Day and do this family picnic thing, and Mom was trying to convince me that I should come. And we were supposed to go to the park and just sit and read the paper for like 8 hours, and I was like, ""Oh, my gosh, that is so going to put me out of my mind."" And for some reason Terri was supposed to come with us, and, you know, she asked Mom, well gee, this didn't have anything to do with music because, you know, Terri kind of doesn't like the concert things that we go to. And she said, ""No, we're just going to go to the park,"" and so was like, ""Oh well, with me and my ______"" kind of thing like she does. And I don't remember if it was her or somebody who told me that there would be something going on downtown that I would like. I don't even remember what it was. It was some kind of like shop or something. Maybe it was a festival in the park or something. But in my dream I was going to start walking, and I was going to make it down there. And it wasn't the usual, typical way that we go downtown, we go B Street south to downtown. But in this dream I kind of went a little east and mostly north. The numbers were all mixed up in my dream and weren't what they really are. But the location that I started out in was 5th Street going north, and I was going to cross on 30th Avenue, and like, you know, across 30th Avenue is like a totally unknown ______. I mean, I know when I'm at 7th and 8th Street and I cross over to 30th Avenue on my way to _______, but I've never really been across 30th Avenue at 5th Street, and so they were called all kinds of different numbers in my dream, but that's what they were. And I got to this place that kind of was a little like downtown Westport, but it was rougher than downtown Westport I don't know how it really is, but I could see downtown Westport as being quite laid back and easy-going and having a lot of art and culture in it, and not having a lot of rough and crime and stuff. That's all in mid-town. But in my dream, mid-town was downtown. And I was walking along this storefront strip mall thing, and there was like a Shnip Shop (?) thing and I had the notion that somebody had stolen the cassette tape that was shrink-wrapped. Two boys on bikes, and they were kind of like -- I don't want to say harassing, but that's kind of what they were doing in a subtle way. They were kind of like asking me question and talking to me, trying to be friends, but I knew they were up to no good. They said, ""Here, I've got something for you,"" and they gave me this tape that I knew they stole. And just then this police car went by, and it didn't stop; it just went by. And then there was somebody riding a bike, and I took this tape that was stolen and I tossed it into their basket and I made it as they were going by. And so now it was on their hands. When I saw the cop car going by, I was thinking that I would say, ""Look, somebody gave me this tape and I think it was stolen,"" but it didn't really stop, so I couldn't do that. And then Mom was with me suddenly somehow, and we were going in this art gallery. And we were walking around looking at pots and things, and there was a piano. I thought, ""Oh, I can go over and play the piano,"" and the people ______________ and I just felt like they weren't going to tell me off. And it was a grand piano with the small lid folded back, but the big lid wasn't raised. And I was trying to, I remember I didn't really touch the keys, but I played something that was kind of nice. And then I was trying and trying to play ""Hero"" and I couldn't really play it. Sometimes in dreams when I dream about playing, it's as if I have this score in front of me laying down and my fingers are punching the staff and trying to move on the staff instead of moving on the keyboard, and that's how it was when I was trying to play ""Hero."" I was at a desk; I wasn't even at the piano any more. And then I woke up and I realized it was all a dream."
"D-010"	"#D-010 (2010-06-30 (25)) We were going up to see Sandra and Uncle Larry and Levi. I don't remember if we flew or drove, but they were in another state, I think. And at the time they were living in an apartment and ________________ the other kids. And we were going to stay with them, but they just seemed like they weren't ready to have us stay with them. They wanted to have us stay in a hotel. And so we got a hotel room and we kind of set ourselves up. But then for some reason the family just kind of got busy and wasn't really ready to have us do anything, and we were supposed to go to the beach, we're supposed to do different things and they just sort of didn't seem ready, didn't seem to want to do any of that. So Mom and Dad would leave me in the hotel room and go over to their house or to their apartment and help them with a few things around there. I don't exactly what, some things that they needed. And I was there by myself, and I was a little disappointed about not seeing Sandra and the kids, and I was disappointed about not being able to relax and have fun with them. But I was kind of relieved of, you know, Mom and Dad actually ended up sleeping over at their apartment. ____ that's kind of neat that I could sleep by myself, and in this dream I was, you know, going down to the restaurant part of the hotel, and they had a piano. And I sat down and I started playing. And there were a bunch of people there that seemed to sort of like it. And different things were happening, different people coming over and talking to me. And I intended to play some more, but I didn't get to because so many people were talking to me. And then I woke up. "
"D-011"	"#D-011 (2010-08-13 (25)) [very hard to hear] We were in Jackson with Aunt Christine, and there were some strangers there. Maybe it was Uncle Burt & Bobby. I don't see them that much, so maybe they were the strangers. But at first I was like sitting in a living room, but it didn't really look like their living room. It looked kind of more like Melinda's living room. And they had a really nice sound system. They put it on, and I was listening to something while I was drawing or writing. I was bored, trying to use up the time, you know. And I don't know what Mom and Dad were doing. They were out shopping or some activity like that. And there was something to do with the kitchen, I don't remember what. Somebody was either painting the kitchen or cooking in the kitchen or doing something. And then I got tired and I think I went to bed, but I'm not sure. Maybe I just slept on the couch.  And the next day Mom was saying something about wanting to do something with Aunt Christine's mirror because in this dream when you would go into the bathroom, it would be these three mirrors all tilted in toward each other like a bay window. One mirror was nice and a little fancy, like a little bit of ____________. The middle mirror was like really, really, really fancy. And the mirror to the right was like falling apart and real plain, so Mom decided she wanted to make the right mirror a little fancy to go with the one on the left. So she said, ""Do you want to stay with me and work on the mirror, or do you want to walk?"" and I wanted to walk and I said in this dream, something about how I did all the scribbling I could possibly do yesterday. And so we walked a little, and we came to this park and they were having like this fair and we were walking around these different booths ________________. ______________________ _________________________. And then _____________________ kind of looked like our park. And I could hear the band, and I was running up the hill to get closer to the band ___________________. And there were some ducks along the way and I was stopping to look at the ducks. I couldn't really get close to them.  Then I woke up. And actually before all of this, ______________________________. And so of course Aiden was bouncing off the walls when it was time to go. I didn't want him running around tearing stuff up.  And so I was on the porch and I was swinging on the swing and playing a little game with him. And then I was able to pick him up and carry him like a baby, right out the front door to his parents."
"D-012"	"#D-012 (2010-08-13 (25)) I had another kind of crazy dream about being in Jackson. I couldn't figure out if I was in Jackson or I was in a class. Believe it or not. We were doing this Jeopardy game and it was really like awful stuff. I wanted to go with some other students to go have my picture taken by the kindergarten pod at Oceanside. I felt like we were there. But yet we were in this classroom doing this Jeopardy game __________ and I don't remember what it was about. I think it was something about geography. And then the next thing I knew I was like down in Aunt Christine's basement by the washing machine, and I had a desk and a computer and I was entering _________________. And I was thinking to myself how I really, I didn't want to be down there, but I could fool myself into thinking I was just in a room and not in a basement, which is kind of how I would think when I would sneak down there. And I was hearing this story. Somebody was talking and telling me this story about an organist who played a morning service, an afternoon service and an evening service. He had like three services in a day, and he had to play them all at this organ that was in this basement. He had to come down there and ________ off in the sanctuary. That was really bizarre. And I was thinking how really I wouldn't want to be down there for that long. I guess that came from one day I was joking around about the hot water heater in our cellar, and I was saying how, you know, the ducts for the heater, ""Oh, these could be organ pipes and the console could be right down here."" And then I thought ______________, ""I wouldn't want to play down here."" And Mom said, ""Well, no you wouldn't, especially if somebody shut off the light and closed the door."""
"D-013"	"#D-013 (2010-08-14 (25)) I was back in New York City, but the city was a lot quieter and a lot more peaceful. And I was still with the POE group (Pipe Organ Encounter workshop I went to) and I guess we had made arrangements to stay there for like longer. And I had settled into this little room that was like set into this huge building, but it was like a really little room with only one little single bed and no even like any furniture or anything. I just had a place to plop all my baggage. I had like three or four suitcases. But I was thinking, ""You know what? This is perfect,"" because I didn't really mind not having any furniture. I was just glad to be like by myself so I could go there and have some alone time. And it had this, what I liked about it was it had this huge open window. It didn't even have a frame or anything. It was like stone, like just open like it would be in a cathedral. It was just open, like to the outside elements, and I could, you know, it would be -- in this dream it was kind of cool and breezy, but it felt really nice. And I don't know exactly what we were doing. I didn't even remember it this morning. It was real foggy. But we were going someplace and I must've either got left behind or decided to explore, because I was like crossing the street by myself and I was, you know, it was like 4th Street. It was as busy as 4th Street. And I was thinking, ""Oh gosh, I'm lost. How am I ever going to cross this busy, busy street?"" It was a little bit scary, but not too much. I mean, it wasn't the same kind of scary that I have sometimes in dreams. And some stranger was there to help me, and I was really glad. And that's really all I can remember of that. I just remember feeling generally good that I could stay there and be with all these great organ people and stuff. And that same night I faded into this dream that I still had the twin beds upstairs from the girls and for some reason Mom and Dad and I were all sleeping up there. It must have been like we used to do when company was in town. And for some reason Dad was like laying down and going to sleep and Mom put the radio on really loud. It was my clock radio that's over there. And she was like in the bathroom brushing her teeth and I was up going to the toilet and stuff, and it was, it was on really loud. And I kept thinking he was going to wake up and he was going to be mad. And he woke up and he just kind of took like his duffel bag and stuff and went downstairs and turned on the bathroom light. And it was kind of looking like he was moving towards sleeping down there, and Mom and I were going to sleep upstairs in the twin beds, and I was like, ""Whoo hoo!"" And then I had a dream that we were going to this PTA meeting type of a thing. And we were at Westport High School and we were going to have some kind of banana bread or something that I had baked. And next thing I knew some of these like teacher people were going to come over to our house and we were going to have waffles or something. And next thing I knew Dad was in the front yard just throwing things out of Mom's shed in a real fit like he gets sometimes and saying, ""We're going to have people over tomorrow. Right now, today, you're going to clean this out."" And I took off, I was wearing a sweater at the time. I took off my sweater and I threw it at him and I said, ""What, what the hell are you doing?!"" And it was like it didn't even come out that loud. It was going like this [muffled sound] . And I barely had a voice, but I yelled as loud as I could. And I don't remember what happened. I think he just kind of backed away into the mist and everything faded into a mist, and then I woke up."
"D-014"	"#D-014 (2010-08-16 (25)) Let's see, first I was doing something at school. And I don't know what it was, but I was with a group of other students, like some of the ones from the organ group and we were going into a place that was like the Bancroft Middle School gym and they said that there was going to be a Celine Dion concert, and that they were going to take pictures and do a sound check and everything, and they were going to let us in ahead of time. And so I was with Johanna and she took me right down in front, and we were sitting and waiting for the concert to start. This gym had a dome, like the ________ dome, and it was all blue. And then when the concert started, they would project different images on it and stuff. And it seemed like they were taking forever to get things together. And I really didn't hear anything at the sound test, I didn't see any behind-the-scenes things. There were two or three clowns dancing around and acting crazy, and a person behind the stage doing the sound test. It was really just other people doing really boring stuff, like a typical sound test would be. And so I was talking to Johanna but I was digging in my purse and I was getting my new monocular and I was starting my recorder, and I was trying to use my cell phone to call home to tell Mom where I was and what I was doing. I felt like we were close to home, and I had to meet up with her later that night to do something. And every time, I found out the hard way why they tell you not to use cell phones because when I would use my cell phone and talk, the sound would somehow weaken the PA so you couldn't hear it like in the concert hall, so like everybody could hear what I was saying. I was so embarrassed. But then the concert was about to start and everybody was parading around on the first song It was like a Prince song. I couldn't hardly hear that well, even though we were right down front. And she was wearing that metal like top that you see in the Taking Chances tour video. And then I woke up and I was like, I moved on, I didn't wake up, but I moved on to the next scene. I needed to connect with Mom because I was having an organ recital that evening at the Palladium. It was going to be, I thought it was going to be just me for a whole hour, but as it turned out, it was me and this other boy that I met on our trip that was going to do the finale. And I was thinking to myself, ""Do I know enough repertoire to fill up a half an hour?"" And are my silly, diddly little choral preludes going to be enough to satisfy them, or are they going to want big honking, loud and like Widor stuff? And I didn't even know the organ, and it was like the night of the show. And Mom took me there, and we got there like about 7:00 and I was supposed to play at 8:00. And _________. There was a bedroom in there for artists to stay in. It was like a hotel room that was backstage. And there was this, I don't know why, but I was laying down in this bed, waiting for somebody to roll the organ out. And I was laying in bed and there was like a pedal board attached to the foot board and I was trying to practice one of my pieces with my hands in the air. And I was like, ""This is like so not working!""  And then I was going up the stage to the organ to get settled, and I was thinking, ""God, I have like no time to like a) practice my piece to get the feel of the action and b) settle my stops and my pistons and everything."" And I didn't even know if we were allowed to set pistons. And I just put on something that sounded kind of cheesey like an 8 foot and a 2 foot flute stop, and then just a regular diapason 8 foot on the Great. And I was practicing, it wasn't really anything actually that I know, it was just something. And then this other boy came up, and it was like 7:30 by that time and it was time for him to play his piece. And I was really worried about how it was going to go, but I just figured what the heck. I mean, I'm just gona' have to wing it. And then he seemed kind of nice, like he's going to help me set the pistons. And then I woke up."
"D-015"	"#D-015 (2010-08-19 (25)) I was at the supermarket looking at __________. Actually _________________________. Before that I was _________ with Mrs. McBride, and she was teaching a lesson at Terri's house. And it was dark and it was dingy. Actually, wait. Before that, See, when you think about things remember more of it. I was playing the piano for Mrs. McBride's choir and we were in a school room. And I was playing these simple little songs like ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" and different little carols and __________________ __________. And I was playing them all in the key of D, and I probably shouldn't have done that.  But I guess the ones that are in penta chord form I should play in D because that's the range for a young child's voice; it sets the best in their head voice. And in my dream pretty much all these songs were in penta chord form, so I guess that's why I played them all in D. And I was just sort of [tape goes blank] . For most of them I was able to fudge my way through in accompaniment style, and then I said we were in a classroom while we were doing this. She had this Irish song that was a more complicated arrangement, and it had a recorder solo. And she had a little organ in the music room. It was like the one I practiced on at the college. It was a little, little bitty, bitty, bitty pipe organ with a free-standing case. But she made it play really loud with mixtures and a full chorus and everything and a recorder solo was heard above it. I don't remember which song it was, but it was something. And that little children's choir was able to sing out above that loud organ. And then next thing I know, she and I and her kids were at Terri's house with some bizarre reason. And I don't even remember what we were doing. I think it was some kind of a lesson, but I don't remember what it was. And then there was this book, and it had this story that like went on forever, and it was all supposed to be sung. And I was just flipping through it and reading the words and glancing up at the staff every now and then to kind of see what the melody was doing. And I couldn't really understand it. It was like chant or shape notes or something wacko like that. And I was thinking to myself, ""I hope Terri's alarm doesn't work any more and I hope she ____________ whatever."" Because Terri wasn't home and we were just like crashing in her house _________. And there was something more to this, but I can't remember what we were doing. I don't know. Then suddenly I was walking to the supermarket, and I was roaming around, I had all these bags like Mom brings and I was trying to look for groceries. But I couldn't find anything. I wandered through this part of the store that had a wood floor _____ table, and some people were having like a banquet there, you know like those catered things sometimes. And I was hungry; I wanted some. But I wasn't invited, so I couldn't barge in. And I was wandering around and wandering around and looking and looking, and I was able to find a few things, but it was not really near what I had come for. And then I went out to the parking lot because I thought somebody was going to drive me home. Somebody had talked to me at one time that they were going to drive me home. And this Grandpa truck was in the parking lot and I had the keys and I opened up the door, and I turned the ignition to run position so that the accessories would run, and there was some jazz, 98.7 on the radio. And I loaded up the one or two bags of groceries that I had and I was sitting there listening for like a half an hour. And nobody showed up to drive me home.  And this time in this dream, I didn't even want to drive. And so I turned off the ignition and locked it with the key, like it was a car. And I locked up the door and I took my groceries, and this time when I got out of the truck, I not only had my two bags of groceries, I had like bazillions of water jug bags, just like Mom has. They were all empty. And I was going back in the door, and I came in like a back door, and I was standing there like blah. And some lady said, ""Oh, I'll take those for you because I'm going to go and get water myself."" And I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, I realized, ""Well, gee, what are we going to use when we go to get water next time?"" And then I woke up."
"D-016"	"#D-016 (2010-08-20 (25)) It was the middle of the night and a helicopter landed on Cassandra's house. I think that I felt like the reason why they did is because they had some kind of emergency and they couldn't go any further, so then like emergency landed on Cassandra's house. Then a plane emergency landed on our house, because the plane had to rescue whoever was in the helicopter. [laugh] And it was kind of funny because we all thought it was going to be bad and, you know, when the plane landed on our house, it kind of knocked a few boards loose, but it didn't really flatten the house like sometimes we say it will. I'm trying to think. And it was a general scene where all of us were up kind of late, it was past 11:00 or 12:00 at night, and I think it was like one other person, it was one of the first nights Mom and Dad were back in town. And I think Dad was talking on the phone and Mom was doing something like shuffling papers on the dining room table. And I was up late, I was watching something on TV. And then I don't remember what happened ______ but next thing I knew it was Halloween and I didn't have like the stuff set up like I usually do. Oh, I know, part of this was when we were up late, I was on the porch, and it was another one of those dreams where we listened to the boom box and I couldn't shut it off when I realized that Mom & Dad were home. And I couldn't even take the batteries out. It was the funniest thing. And so I turned it all the way down and it still could be heard. And then the next thing I knew, it was Halloween and I didn't have my stuff set out like I usually do. And I was upstairs digging some more stuff out, and next thing I knew, the doorbell rang, and it was people {trick-or-treaters} and you know how you give each people two things of candy in their bag _______________, well this kid said, ""No, I want a big one like my brother; I want a blue one."" And I said, ""Okay, I don't think I have one, but you can look."" And he looked and looked, ""No, you don't have one."" And so I said, ""Well, have a good _____,"" and he left.

The one scene I can remember in this dream: Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and I were going to go somewhere, or maybe it was Aunt Polly and me. And we were in the back yard and she said, ""When I tell you, you go out the gate, and once you've closed the gate, I'll go out the front door and I will meet you."" So she said something and I went out the gate and I closed it behind me and, of course, I knew she was turning on the security system. But before I got too far away, these electronic voices said - ""Wait, you went out the gate. You did not close the gate."" And I turned around, and sure enough, the gate was wide open and I ran back there and I closed and latched it as best as I could. Then it happened again. I walked away and I got a little ways toward the alley, and I turned back and the gate was still wide open. And I ran back for a third time. I can't remember if I did it three or four times, but I started thinking. ""I am running out of time and I need to get away fast."" So I ran, and in this dream I could run, but sometimes I can't. And I was running and running _____________________ and I didn't hear anything in this dream, but I knew what was coming and I was glad I could get away.

I tried and tried to call them. I tried Information and couldn't get anywhere with that. And I was walking around aimlessly in the park feeling like a disgrace. I'm trying to think. I was first of all feeling afraid and second of all, feeling like a total idiot. I mean, why can't I do a simple thing like close the gate? And I feel like it was going to be a really bad thing for them. And then the next thing I knew, Aunt Polly found me in the park. And I sat there and I put my arm around Uncle Charlie's shoulders, and I said, ""I'm sooo sorry for making your alarm sound because I couldn't close the gate in time. And Aunt Polly's like, ""No, we're sorry."" And I don't remember exactly what happened then. I think we were all at a restaurant, and we were eating like corn and applesauce and then I woke up."
"D-018"	"#D-018 (2010-09-05 (25)) Last night I was having a dream. It was weird, certain things around me that looked like our house down there, but really I think I was in Jackson with my Mom and Dad. And it was, you know, I enjoyed my trip for the most part when I flew up there. So in this dream I was still up there and I was like, it was the day before and I was going to ride home in the car with them. And I remember it just felt like the very last hurrah before the final, you know, everything how was I going to survive the trip home and all like that. I don't remember too many of the scenes, but the one I really remember is that I was at this park, the one that the creek was at, so it's odd because it looked kind of like our waterfront, but I knew that it was a park by Aunt Christine's house. And I had my keyboard out on a picnic table. Don't ask me where I was getting power from.  And I was out there and I was just playing. I was just enjoying myself. And then I was like digging for my cell phone so I could call home and find out how much time I had. And then Mom came up. She had walked to a store and come back. I don't remember what she was saying, but I think she was saying just general stuff. It was kind of odd, she was taking pictures of the waterfront, and I had my practice book. Then, we were saying goodbye to Aunt Christine. In the next little scene, I was home, and I had my cockatiel named Archie. He keeps showing up in my dreams, and when ever he shows up in my dreams, it's like I forget that I still have a bird, and I forget to feed him and give him water. Or I neglect to clean his cage for a few weeks on end. Whenever I find him, I remember that I have a bird. Then, I hurry up and give him food and water. So I feel so terrible. How could I ever be so neglectfuland forget to feed him. And I don't know why I keep dreaming that. I even had one dream that he died of thirst. But in this dream he was alive, and I replaced his drinking water. In this dream he was living in both his own and in Tweety's old cage. So I replaced two different food dishes and two different water dishes. And I was feeling so bad that as I usually do, that he was there all along and I hadn't taken care of him. . Then I woke up."
"D-019"	"#D-019 (2010-09-07 (25)) Last night I was having some pretty interesting dreams. First I dreamed that Mom and Dad, Uncle Carl, and maybe Aunt Joyce. We were all at Westportr's Church. And we, I didn't know that Mr. Dawson was the organist; I didn't know who the organist was. And for some reason we were sitting way in the back and I felt really bashful. You know how it is when the family only comes to church once a year. They were giving people like party favors as they were leaving, like a tape and a hat and a brochure, hoping they'd study it and come back. I was thinking to myself how the organ was in the same position as the sound booth at my high school auditorium. You not only had to go up to the balcony, but you had to go way up to the top. It was in a little extra room. Then, next thing I knew, it turned into Westportr's Cathedral, and the organist there was some lady that wasn't anyone in particular that I know. She was saying that I could come and practice and get to the organ, and I could come and listen to the services and see how they went. It was all empty and she was showing me around. She showed me that up in the chancel, behind the choir stalls and behind some heavy curtains, there was this boat horn like thing, like Uncle Larry (Aunt Janice's husband) had on his boat. She said, ""This is really loud, if you touch this, it's going to BLARE!"" But the light switch was right over there, so you had to go over there to turn on the lights in the chancel. We never did get to the organ because then there were some other people going by and saying, ""Hi, nice to meet you."" Somebody had a dog, and I was sitting on a couch. The dog jumped in my lap. And I was sitting and petting the dog. He was really sweet. He was a black dog, not real big, about the size of Bella I think. And that's all there was to it."
"D-020"	"#D-020 (2010-09-10 (25)) I was at the farm cottage, I was up in Jackson. But it was on this acre or two, I mean instead of being in the middle of absolute nowhere, it was on this acre or two property, and we had a gravel, stone driveway like Grammy had. And it even had wooden things in the gravel, almost like a wooden boardwalk up to the house. . Anyway, we lived in a little community, kind of almost like one of those subdivision things, and all of the properties kind of looked like this. And they were spaced out more than subdivisions usually are. And I didn't even get the feeling like we were in Jackson all the time. It felt like a warmer climate. And so basically, we were milling around and doing different things. The inside looked quite a bit like our house. Let's see, click, I can't remember any real action in this, but at some time, I felt like we were riding around in the truck, around different places, and other times we were walking. And everybody was getting along pretty well, but I just felt that we were all too close together, you know, I'm used to having lots of space, and here, everybody was practically on top of me all the time, just like it was when we were at the farm. But yet the land was so beautiful and I was so happy to just have a break from everything. I believe the house had power, but not as much as you'd usually have. If I had to put it in technical terms, I'd say that the fuse box was rated for, like, 5 or 6 amperes at the most, but of course, I didn't think that in this dream. It had lights, and we could run our sound system in the living room like at home, but it didn't have, like, air conditioners and washers and dryers and all that stuff. So I was thinking to myself that I really wouldn't mind being at the farm by myself for a while. And by the end of this dream -- Oh, I know, somewhere in the middle, Mom was supposed to take me out through the back of the house. See, I had only been coming in and out of the front of the house, but Mom wanted to show me the back of the house, because it was right on this beautiful body of water. But she never did show me. Then, Terri popped in and was yacking and talking. There was something about bread, she was putting bread in the toaster. We were having this discussion about wheat bread versus white bread. It was a bagel, it was a white bread bagel. And then, we were riding in the truck again. Then, we were walking somewhere, it was very urban. Like when we take the bike to my bank and we ride under the overpass and see all the homeless people, and sometimes there's construction. It's just so loud, you've got the cars, and the echo and the construction equipment, it's such an assault on the senses. It wasn't that loud in this dream, but it looked like that. We were walking to some store with an older couple. And then I woke up."
"D-021"	"#D-021 (2010-09-19 (25)) I had like three things going on at once, and one of them was an AGO [American Guild of Organists] meeting that I wanted to go to. One of them was a class, and one of them was something else that I don't remember. And I was supposed to set up a cab to get to at least two of these things. I realized that it was after 5:00, and I had forgotten to set up my cab.  And then the scene of action in this dream was, I guess I was at the class and I didn't even have to go to the school. I was in my bedroom and it was a lot bigger, and there were like three or four other girls with me that I didn't know and we were supposed to be in the class. And this teacher came in and started giving us a lecture. She was making up talking points about how our water system worked. She was like making up this presentation about how they started running water through the city and through the pipes and up to the houses. And I was writing notes and papers. Everybody was goofing off. I don't remember _______________. It was just a dream about having too much to do and not enough time to do it."
"D-022"	"#D-022 (2010-09-25 (25)) It was something to do with the fact that I was planning to walk downtown to some kind of concert festival thing. I think it was supposed to be the crawfish festival that they had that I've never really been to because we're always so busy at that time of the year, but I've always wanted to go. In this dream it was a lot of thought, and not that much action, and I was just sort of thinking how if I really wanted to go, I was just going to have to walk. And then when I get there I was just going to have to figure out what was where, all by myself. "
"D-023"	"#D-023 (2010-09-25 (25)) We had chickens agob. We had three or four chickens, and four or five geese that were like the geese from the park. They made for quite the menagerie of pets. It was the same thing again, I was thinking how I hoped I wouldn't forget to feed them. This time, we had just gotten them. I was sitting in the yard, and they were coming around me, and I was making a mental note how I'd have to remember to feed them. Not only that, I felt an immense responsibility to protect them if any of those crazy raccoons or opossums came around. "

So get this: She had to float a bucket in the toilet, and put the phone in the bucket so that whatever she would pee in the bucket would go over the phone to the doctor's office! In this dream, I had to go to the toilet. I remembered that the bucket was there, and I was just going to take it out. But the bucket tipped, and it got full of water, and the phone got wet. So I took it out quickly and put it on a side, and I was wondering if I was going to get an electric shock. See, this was the kitchen phone, and it was still, like, attached to the wall. But how we had it in the bathroom, I don't know, go figure. I think that's all there was to it. "
"D-025"	"#D-025 (2010-09-29 (25)) I was having some pretty interesting dreams last night. First of all I dreamt that Mom & I were riding bikes, and we were going down to the beach. And there was some kind of festival with a lot of music going on at the Scenic Point or Becker Park or something like that. . We were walking along the shore and we were swimming in the water, we were walking along, even when we were walking along the waterfront, and apparently there was some place where we could get down by the water to swim. And I was saying we should go over a little bit closer to where the festival was so that we could still hear the music. And we had some kind of picnic, and I'm trying to remember, I think before that we were at some kind of show and there were these girls in all these pink dresses and they were like singing or dancing or something. And Dad was there, and I think Mr. Dawson was there, and Mom was there. And we were all going to go to a park or something, and I just ______, ""Oh that's so boring and so ___________ always do that. I don't want to do that again."" And that's when Mom and I went to the beach. I was thinking how going to the beach with Dad would be so very boring, but with just Mom & I, it was pretty fun. In this dream, the weather was very nice, too.  Then I can't remember any songs that I really recognized, but they were playing, like, oldies songs. "
"D-026"	"#D-026 (2010-09-29 (25)) Somehow I found this ca__ that somebody must have given me years ago and I didn't know that I had. It was like a PDA thing, like a PDA thing for people that were visually impaired with sound only. And I couldn't really figure out what it did, or how it was supposed to work, but I was trying to figure out how it was supposed to work. When you first turn it on, it's really loud. I had to make it quieter to actually figure out how to make it work. And it looked a lot like the calculator I used to use in middle school. And that was kind of all there was to it. I guess it wasn't all that interesting after all. I could have sworn there was more to it."
"D-027"	"#D-027 (2010-09-30 (25)) Last night I had spme pretty strange dreams. First, the one I can remember best, is that Mom and I were in the airport and we were going somewhere. Actually I can't remember where we were going. ____ leaving town as if we were going to my relative's home town. And I had to go to the bathroom, actually, we both did.  For some reason, we went in the same stall _______kind of take turns going and we chattered and took turns going______. So that's what we did in this airport dream.______ Well, we heard this message come over the intercom, talking to some other person, telling this other person that they had better go quickly, not just sit around, or the toilet would flush automatically before they were ready. And I realized that they were doing surveillance on us and they were making it so that only one person could go at a time, making it so that it would flush automatically for each person, so that I don't even know why they would have a reason to do this I guess they thought maybe somebody would either waste water or waste something _______________. But I was having her open the stall and then close it again so that it would seem like another person went in there so that I could go too, and they wouldn't know we were both in there. As I describe this, I remembered what happened before this, what led up to this. I was dreaming that Mom and Dad were home and for some reason Mom and I were both sleeping in the bedroom downstairs. And Dad was supposed to come to the bed in a little while, but he was playing his computer game or something. And it was like 11:00 at night, but Mom said, ""I'm hungry. I want to go eat something."" And so I suggested, ""Well, we should go upstairs to my bed so that when Dad goes to bed in his bed and goes to sleep, we can get up without waking him up. Because if we stay here and he goes to sleep, when we get up, then he'll wake up."" So we went up to my bed and then, I guess, before we knew it we were walking downtown to this restaurant. And it was someplace -- I don't remember where it was -- oh, it was a Chinese place. And I had, we were all kind of sharing, but I had some kind of chicken, it was like fried sesame chicken, but it was, there was something else too. And there wasa plate of something else too, some kind of meat. And I was thinking, you know, ""I should have vegetables, spinach and meat and ______."" And I thought ""I usually have meat and a vegetable. And she said, ""Oh well, it's alright."" You don't have to worry about that, you have vegetables in the freezer. I couldn't really taste in this dream, but as I ate the fried chicken, I realized that there was some broccoli and some other kind of steamed vegetables in the sauce too. I can't remember what the other dish was that I had. And I think, I don't know, I thinkthe air port thing was separate, not part of the restaurant thing. And I think that's all I can remember for now. "
"D-028"	"#D-028 (2010-10-03 (25)) I was at Bob's house for some kind of a party. And even before that I was at the grocery store. I was shopping for groceries and it was a smaller store than Safeway. And when I went to check out, I had a couple of hundred dollar bills in my purse and I handed one to the lady. And instead of breaking it and giving me change, she was like, ""Okay,"" and just looked at it and gave it back to me. It was as if, I think there was like this unspoken thing where he sort of initially took thirty of it, and then the next time I came, she would take some more, kind of like an electronic birthday card or something.  And then the next thing was that I was at Bob's house for a party. And I don't know, something happened. What the deal was, is Bob______ _________________ really nice and generous, and Diana's husband is like extremely rude and extremely selfish. And I felt sorry for Diana. Diana is so nice and her husband is such a jerk. But he was nice to me when I interacted with him and __________________________ really ______. So in this dream I think everybody was partying around and being happy and _____________ in Bob's house. And Jason was there too, and Jason had, like his own little living room, and it's like he'd walk up these steps and go behind the curtain and you opened the door, and went in his own little living room like behind the curtain and closed the door and sitting there all alone in the house. And he'd come out a little while for this party, but in this dream, I went in the bathroom. I didn't really have to go, but I don't know, I was in the bathroom in this dream. And they were talking about something helping me ? _ either shopping or writing a play or something _________________. But Bob and Jason were like yelling at each other and Bob said, ""Alright then, if that's how you feel, you can go back to your corner."" And then I came out, and I went in this room where there was not one, but three or four or five pianos. And I was like, ""Wow! Wooo-hooo!"" And I was going to sit down and play, and at first for some reason, there were a couple of ladies in that room, and I was, I guess I didn't really want to get too close to them.  so I sat down at this upright. It had kind of a wiggly bench, you know, like the ones at the college that are not well kept, and it's like kind of dilapidated. And then I kind of had a little trouble getting started, and I was like, ""Well, if they don't mind, I want to go and play the big grand piano."" They were like, ""Okay."" And it was like _______________ biggest, like I don't think it was a 9-foot, but it was a 6-foot. And so I picked up the small lid, and I picked up the fallboard and I started to play Sweet Adeline, and somebody picked up the bigger lid. And, you know, in dreams I can never play.  I remember [inaudible]"
"D-029"	"#D-029 (2010-10-05 (25)) Last night, I had a dream that we still had three chickens. I had seed, and they were eating it out of my hand, and I was out in the yard. I had something when I was out in the yard with them; I had the feeling that maybe it was a bunch of sound equipment on the picnic table, and I was bringing it in little by little. The part of this dream that I can remember best was that Mom was doing something, I can't remember exactly what she was doing, but I felt like she was packing things up. She seemed to have one foot out the door in terms of leaving Dad. So I went in the bathroom and I whispered to her, ""If you're leaving, you'd better take me with you."" She said, ""I'm not leaving, I'm just thinking of moving. "" In my mind, I was thinking, ""same difference"". She said, ""I have to be real careful with my shoes because this wood floor will scratch. And these spoons, if you scoop ice cream with them, they'll bend"" - or something silly like that."
"D-030"	"#D-030 (2010-11-03 (25)) I was in Cassandra's house and that somehow she had this upstairs, and it was sort of like Uncle Carl's upstairs in that all the floors were wood. It was open and spacious and there was lots of natural light. And there were like different rooms. There were like three or four rooms up there. The foyer was like huge. And then there was like an office, a bathroom, and then like two bedrooms. And as I was up there, we were like visiting with some people that I didn't really know. And as I was up there, it was hard for me to tell whether it was Cassandra's second floor or whether it was our third floor. But I think at the beginning of the dream it was hers, Cassandra's, and then at the end of the dream it was ours. And whoever owned it was renting it out because who would need all that space up there, right? And there was a family living up there. And I'm starting to remember something about the beginning of this dream now. And actually I think we were supposed to do something and I kind of ran away and escaped up there so I could have some privacy and be alone. And I think I was in a room that was like my bedroom, except it was bigger and it was like cold. I mean there were like vents in the floor and the air-conditioning was coming up from the floor and it was cold. And I turned on a radio and I laid down in the bed, and the next thing I knew I was out in the foyer and I was visiting with these people. And then a little while later I got the feeling that maybe Mom and Dad owned the place, and one of the ladies said, ""Maggie, could you please turn the air down? It's cold up here. I have a child in the shower right now."" And I can't remember what she said. I think she said, ""Oh, well, it's not been cold up here, what are you talking about?"" And then I woke up."
"D-031"	"#D-031 (2010-11-05 (25)) we were in the green truck. We were coming home from some kind of a long trip, either from Jackson or another state or something. And we were going through our state and it was the last day we were on the road. And you know how you'd enter the state and you're, ""Whoo hoo,"" you're in your own state now, but then it takes like a whole other day just to drive through. And so we were in the truck and we stopped up north, and it was kind of up in the northeast corner of the state, I had a feeling that it was. And we were walking around this beach kind of area, and I kind of had the feeling that it's like Celine's house. It was close by her house, because we were on the beach and then there was this like garage that was backed up to the beach. And we wandered in and we were like wandering around. And there was like this person, like a staff person that was real friendly and sort of talking to us. And, you know, I can't remember anything that was said. I just remember being there. And I remember the person, the staff person was real friendly and invited us in, and had us walk around and look around and was going to introduce us. And then there was this other like woman, this woman staff person there who was talking all about what it's like to be pregnant. And I said to her, ""Well, she must have had a hard time walking when she was carrying twins."" And she's like, ""Yeah."" And then we were sitting in this dark living room. It's funny because in the pictures from the ________ interview, everything was light, but in my dream everything was like dark. And we were sitting in the living room and Celine came out. She was wearing black. And Rene was there too and he was wearing black. And I can't really remember much being said. I think Mom and Dad were talking about their trip and stuff. And then I think we were going to walk around and kind of have a tour and then we were going to see the back, which has the pool and the beach and all that stuff, and I remember for some reason next thing I knew we were going back on the road, and we were walking down this long, long dirt road back to the truck. And Rene, the older man Rene, was like wrestling with me and running after me in a kind of fun way, kind of playing, and we were down in this like ravine type of thing and we were wrestling around, and then next thing I know, we're back in the truck and I said, ""Well, where is this place?"" because I kind of sort of knew that it was called Admiral's Cove in Jupiter. And so I was saying to Mom, ""Where is this place?"" and she was pointing on the map that it was up in the northeast corner of the state, which was kind of odd. And all the stuff kept happening. I think that the tires on the truck were just like worn out or something and Dad was like, ""Well, we're going to have to take the streets the rest of the way home instead of the interstate. So anyway, I thought like, ""Oh, brother, this is going to like make the trip like twice as long and I'm going to have to sit and ride like twice as long and I'm good and ready to get home."" And it wasn't a problem, they didn't have an argument. But something happened that Mom was starting to drive and Dad was in the passenger seat to my right, and I was like squished in the middle. He kept having to stop and get out and stuff, I think checking on the tires or something. And Mom put the radio on and she said she was listening for traffic reports, but there was some nice smooth jazz on. And then I woke up. That was really weird."
"D-032"	"#D-032 (2010-11-12 (25)) we were at Pizza Factory and it was just closing down, and they were having some kind of a closing party or something. And I can remember we ate pizza and were listening to the organ. But it was a lot more wood around -- wood floors, wood on the wall, wood tables. And for some reason Dad was supposed to come back and help the people close the place down. He was going to like move tables and take stuff off the walls and everything like that. And so I came back too, thinking that I could kind of play the organ while some of that stuff was going on. And I was up in the organ loft. In this dream the place had an organ loft up in the back where the church would have, instead of having it out front on the lift. And so I was up there and I was at this light wooden organ console that was kind of plain, and it was a horse shoe console like a theater organ, but I was going to play it like a classical organ and practice for church this week. So I was trying to figure out not only how to put the stops on, but how to navigate and get the different people's memory levels so I could get different already pre-programmed pieces. And I had this magnifier and I put it out on the little drawer to the right, and there were like all these weird little buttons and things, but I couldn't figure out what they were for. And I turned it on and I started to play, but it was really, really weird. There was this solo reed stop on the great manual (?) and I was trying to play chords within it, and, of course, it was awful sounding. And I didn't want anybody to hear that, but yet at the same time, I wanted to let them know that I wanted to play. And then next thing I knew there was like this school tour group coming through, so I decided I would get down off the organ bench and let them have a look at it and stuff. And then the tour guide -- all the students left for some reason and the tour guide was wanting to take me back to where Dad was. And I was trying to tell him I'd like to play the organ. And so I think he said, ""Well, we're going to take all the wires out. We're going to undo all the wiring, so you're not going to be able to."" And I was like, ""Alright."" And just about that time I was holding his hand and walking down the hall, and I heard a fire alarm go off in another room, and I like, I fell down to my knees just because I was startled. And I said, ""Can we please go outside?"" And he was like, ""Well, you can't go down the front stairway because it's blocked. We'll have to go down the back stairway."" And I was like half running and half falling down those stairs. It was like round, round and round; it seemed like they would go on forever. And I remembered I had a conscious thought in this dream, I remembered how in a Bach fugue, you have a ______ to _____ you and you have a major chord at the end, and you have some material leading up to it if it's in a minor key. So I thought, ""This is just a dream; I really don't need to be afraid in this dream."" So I was thinking, I imagined the sound in my head of material preparing me for a major chord ending to a minor piece. And on the major chord I pictured myself outside, and then I woke up."
"D-033"	"#D-033 (2010-11-13 (25)) I was at Central Lutheran getting ready to play that service tomorrow. And there were other things leading up to it, like B____ was over and we were going to play some kind of movie, but I don't really remember that part. In this dream I was at the piano and I was playing the National Anthem and they were doing the flag thing in the procession. And that actually went through without any problem, which was _______. And then I hopped over to the organ and was going to play the first hymn, ""God of Our Fathers"" and the organ was like this flimsy cardboard thing. And I started playing the first verse, which kind of went alright with a couple of little problems, but then the second verse, for some reason the organ got flimsier and I got more unsure of myself. And I wasn't really able to reach the pedals any more, and it just all fell apart. It was like, ""ppptttttttttt."" And I tried and I tried and I tried to get it going again and to get the hymn started again, and I just couldn't seem to do it, and then I thought I was starting the right one, but I actually started playing, ""My Faith Looks Up to Thee."" It was just the wrong one_. And I stopped for a while and I just sat there, kind of resigned. And I was going to really play anything. They put on some kind of canned music and, of all people, Mr. Dawson went by. He touched me on the arm and said, ""Hey,"" like he always does. And he said, ""Hey Jasmine, I think you should --."" No, I think he said, ""Learning and practice activities should be done at home."" And I was like, ""Oh, my gosh, he did not hear me fumble through all that."" And I had the feeling that he had been there because Kristen and Dr. Mauk probably told him. Dr. Mauk is Bob Pew's friend, and he is Mr. Dawson's dermatologist. That's funny, isn't it? And so then I was like sitting on a swing or something, feeling pretty dejected, and then I woke up. And I was so relieved that a) none of that actually happened, and b) Mr. Dawson hadn't found out my secret and hadn't heard all of that happening. [laugh]"
"D-034"	"#D-034 (2010-11-20 (25)) I had a dream about the red boat that we used to have. I dreamt that Sandra and the kids were here, but for some reason there was only Sandra. There must have been ________ when Dad was at work, because he wasn't here. And Mom and I and Sandra decided that we were going to take the boat and go to the beach, and so I think -- I can't remember if we hitched it up to the car, or if we tied it on the top of the car, but we did one of the above. And I suggested that we take the green truck and just flop the boat in the back of the truck, but Mom said it wouldn't fit. And so I don't really remember us riding in the boat; I just remember us being at the beach. And I remember swimming in the water. And I remember kind of being _______ boat. And when I was swimming in the water, wouldn't you know, it started to rain. And we were gathering up all our stuff and we were going to run and seek shelter. And, wouldn't you know, the boat was anchored and for some reason it had this odd back-up alarm kind of sound that would go off if you left it unattended for too long. Wouldn't you know it started happening, and Mom had to go and shut that off. And we were getting to pack it up and bring it home, I think, and I think we packed it up and brought it home because of the rain. And then, when we got it home, I think parts of it kind of got scattered all over the house. I think Mom put the boat in the bathtub outside [laugh] and for some reason the motor and other parts got put on the old sleeping couch, where the organ is now in the living room. And some other kind of piece got put in my bathroom upstairs in my tub. [laugh] That was pretty crazy. And so I think maybe in this dream they were going to work on the boat motor or something and I didn't want to be around to hear it because it is so loud. And so I decided I was going to make myself disappear, and in this dream -- not literally, you know -- I was going to take a walk. Dad says, ""Make myself disappear"" or ""make yourself scarce"" or something when he means just go somewhere else. So I had these little pink sandals in my dream, and they had like glitter on them. They were the ultimate dorky little girl things. So I put them on and I started out the front door, and it's one of those things where I couldn't really run, but I was really trying to, and I was trying to get away. And inside I could hear them, Dad was telling Mom that we have to __________ crank up the motor and then I managed to get pretty far away, almost to Merillee's before I heard it faintly, and then I decided I was going to take a walk all around the neighborhood and hopefully be gone until they were done. And then I woke up."
"D-035"	"#D-035 (2010-11-23 (25)) It was something to do with being by the water, and something to do with the mermaid story, but I can't quite remember that part. The part that I do remember is that Uncle Carl was going to set off some kind of great big -- it wasn't actually a bomb that would be intended to hurt people, but it was like a great big, large-scale loud firework thing, mainly to put on a show out in the middle of the water or something. And I remember in this dream we were in the kitchen, and he was testing one in the back yard, and it made this great big ba-boom and it had this flash of light. And I remember it was so loud it hurt, and I mean I don't know how that could manifest in a dream, but anyway he was trying to do another one that was going to be like twice as big, only this one was going to be at the waterfront. And he like set it up on a little boat or a dock or something, or a timer so that it would go off at a certain time, and I just remember we were with him on our bikes, and we were going to a restaurant and walking along the water and stuff, and I always had this fear in the back of my mind that when this thing goes off, it's going to be really loud and I don't want it to hurt my years. So what am going to do about that? And how can I the farthest away as I can? And in this dream all I could think was Beethoven when Napoleon bombed Vienna, the rest of his hearing went. And I kept thinking, ""I don't want to end up deaf like Beethoven."" And I think where we ended up in this dream is I was, it was dark and we were by the comfort station, which is like a brick bathroom place downtown. And we were on a blanket and I think we had a little fire going, like a campfire, like a mini one, and I had my big thick cans from Modern Media College and I was going to put them on, thinking that it would block out the sound of that bomb thing. And then I woke up."

And apparently the band was from Bayside Nursing Home where I play the piano, but the band was going to play like the oldie songs that I really like, like from the 60's and the 70's. And I heard them before and I had the notion that they were really good. And I had the notion that Allen was the keyboard player, wouldn't you know. And I didn't know if the band members were residents or staff, but I thought that they would be residents. And I'm trying to think. I think we were going on the bike and we got like halfway there and Mom got tired and said she had to stop. And she couldn't really go any farther. And I think we were sitting on a boat ramp or something, and there were other people there ______________ and I was wondering and hoping that she was okay, but I was also kind of feeling bad, like, you know, it was made especially apparent to me that my wings were really clipped and I resented that, because I couldn't just pick up and go downtown and enjoy our city any time I wanted to. And so I wasn't really mad at her, but it was a situation that made me regret my own situation itself. And then Dad showed up and some of the other fireman people, just in passing. And I don't know, I think Mom said she was having trouble and she was feeling really weird because of the angle of her spinal cord or something that was causing her whole body to tingle, and that was pretty scary. And Dad was saying to me, ""Well, if you want to walk down ______,"" he was saying, ""She shouldn't be walking down to the water any more. If you want to walk down to the water, you should _________."" And I was thinking, ""Oh, brother, this is truly not good."" And I think I was at home and we ________________, and there was this program on TV about the Westportrsburg waterfront and I was trying to record it, but I was trying to do it the way like I do the Penelope (?) tapes sometimes when I want to prep, where I get the thing set up and I get it going, and then I shut off the TV and the amplifier so it could just do its thing independently. And I know there was some more to it, but I can't remember. "
"D-037"	"#D-037 (2010-11-26 (25)) It's Black Friday, 2010. Last night I had another one of those dumb dreams about school. This time I was at Westport High School because of the friends I was with, but it kind of looked like the college. It sort of was a building that had tables out front, but inside it was kind of like a high school cafeteria. And I think I was with Angie and Hayleigh and Kendra that I was with a lot in high school, you know, the trouble-makers. And in this dream I was having lunch and I was going in and ask them to get my lunch. And Colin Hanks was there, and he was in uniform. Now Steve is a guy that Dad worked with in the Fire Department for many years, but for me, I never really associated him in that role. He's just kind of a goofy guy that we have breakfast with sometimes, you know. But today he was in uniform, and he was sitting in the middle of the cafeteria with a laptop. And he said, ""Hey, Jess, come on over here and sit over here."" And I was kind of like I didn't want to because I kind of knew what he was doing and I didn't want to be around for that. It was one of those things where I wanted to get outside as fast as I could, so I was trying to get my lunch and move around this really crowded place, and I think maybe I did sit down for a few minutes, but I really want to be there. What he was doing is they were going to have a fire drill, and he was sitting there with a laptop watching everybody and timing how long it takes them to get out. And he was going to like make notes and then see well the school had trained these kids and everything. So usually they do this during a class, but, you know, during lunch it would be total chaos. And there wasn't really much to it, except I was really afraid and just managed to get out and I was out in the bus circle before they actually started it. And then it's like I switched to another little scene that I had, I was in my room in Centerville at Cedar Park North, and I had like six or seven, maybe ten baby chicks and they were yellow baby chicks. And for some strange reason I was laying in bed and they were under my covers and they were all walking around and peeping and stuff like baby chicks do. And I think it was cold and I was trying to keep them warm or something. And in this dream I kind of went to sleep and then I woke up. And to my horror, I only had a few of them when I woke up. There were two or three that had died, and the ones that had died weren't like dead bodies per se, but they were like stuffed baby chicks. So it was so, I felt so awful that I had smothered them with the blankets and all. And it was just a really sad, horrible thing, and then I woke up."
"D-038"	"#D-038 (2010-12-01 (25)) we were supposed to be together with family or something, like Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and that we were going to go to some theme park, but somehow in all of this we were riding in the car at nighttime and it's like when we used to bring Samantha and Sandra and Derek home from another state. And they were in the back and I was laying across Mom and Dad's laps in the front. And the next little scene was that somehow I was all grown up and I was supposed to, I was scheming and planning a way to buy two tickets to a theme park and save it. I had won them or something. And I thought I was going to buy two tickets to Adventure Island, but as it turned out, I realized that I wouldn't really want to go there because a lot of the water things that were there have these ____________ and all the scary things in them. So I decided in this dream some strange lady gave me like a program of concerts going on and, you know, ___________. And in this dream I decided that I was going to M______ instead because of all the concerts and everything. And I had come up with this plan thinking that Mom and I would be able to go _______________, but Daddy __________ complaining about everything anyway. And I was looking over this program and it said that Bette Midler and Barbara Streisand and other people were going to be there, and I was trying to make my plan. The hardest _______ deciding which day to go and who to see. And then I woke up."
"D-039"	"#D-039 (2010-12-11 (25)) I was at a HEO convention thing, but it was like my POE trip and it might have been a chapter event, I don't know. But there were a lot of us there and we got this great big packet of stuff, and there were these different presenters giving speeches to us. And somebody -- I think it was Mr. Dawson -- was talking to us about how to diagram something to show the form, and usually a form chart doesn't look like it, but there was all this like tree branches all over the page. And it was apparently showing how a composition was going. And then, before that, there was somebody talking about him playing, and we were talking about picking the right music for the right things. And then when they were talking about the form, they were saying how music is usually learned just mechanically, if you will, but the better you get, the better you get at ideation. And he was going to give us a little bit of dictation, and we were going to fill up this form chart based on what we were hearing in this like new orchestral piece, but first we were going to like listen to each of the themes, and we were going to write them out on a little staff, and we were going to put the letter or the theme next to it. And there was this one that went, [singing] very simple, and apparently it was in G, and it was obviously in 4/4, but the staff that was already provided for me had like one flat and it was the wrong line. It was on the middle line. Now I'm sorry it was on the G where it's normally on the B, so it had a flat that was on the wrong line and it said ¾, and _______ started to write the theme out. I realized that there was a whole bunch of my own writing that wasn't supposed to be there. There were like 16th notes going all over everywhere that should have been like whited-out at some point. And it's like everything was gone except the very ___________ and all its smooshy white-out and it was just really annoying. And I was digging through my bag to see if I could find another piece of staff paper, and I was flipping through my packet to see if I could find a blank piece of staff paper. And I was thinking, ""Oh brother, what am I going to do? This is such a good opportunity, and now it's screwed up."" And then I woke up."
"D-040"	"#D-040 (2010-12-11 (25)) I was in Jackson and I was supposed to catch a plane home. And Mom and I were in this bookstore. It was sort of like ______'s except it mainly sold like books and things. And we were digging through these racks and we were buying books and DVD's and stuff, and I found these books that told the story of ""Little Mermaid"" from the perspective of each of the characters, and the books were like shapes like the characters, and they flat at the binding end and shaped at the other end. And I was supposed to be at the airport at 12:00 and I was supposed to catch my plane at a quarter to 1:00, and so we're digging and we're shopping and dawdling around and ______ I got to the plane ______ got to the plane and then next thing I know, I look at the clock and it's like 5:00 and I totally missed the plane and they didn't get me to the airport on time. And I was so mad. And then I woke up."
"D-041"	"#D-041 (2010-12-26 (25)) Well, I think -- it's hard to tell sometimes -- but I think in this dream I was a little kid again. And I was playing in the yard, and then I was playing with the barn set upstairs like in a loft or something in the garage that kind of was like a hay loft almost. And I was waiting for Sandra and Lee to call because we were waiting to go somewhere with them. And finally they called. I heard the phone ring, and they wanted us to meet them at this department store. And so we got in the car and the _________ and Dad had the radio on and it was some lady singing with a piano and the flute. And for some reason, obviously, I didn't want to run all around the department store, so Mom and Dad were going to leave me in the car with the radio on with the ignition on so the accessories would run the _______ and all, you know how that goes. But some older lady was there with us, and she said, ""Oh, come in the store."" And she seemed like she wanted to buy me something, she wanted to cheer me up or something. She thought that I would have more fun in the store than sitting in the car. So I went along with her, but in my mind I'm thinking, ""Oh gosh,"" because you know those places can be kind of crowded and noisy and boring, to say the least. So the lady took us to the shoe department and I was wearing sandals. And she found these like tassel things, like from my graduation cap, and she hitched them onto my, she tried to hitch them onto my shoes. And then she saw these little teddy bear charms and she tried to hitch those onto my shoes. And she said, ""There, isn't that nice!"" And I thought, ""As long as you're happy, kid."" But then as we were walking around, and we were with Sandra and Lee, it was starting to get dark. It wasn't starting to get dark outside, but the lights were starting to go out. And I seem to recall in the store they were playing, ""You gotta tell me too, exactly what to do what to do, and I'm so in love with you."" And we didn't like that too much. We thought that was a song from the devil. And it is kind of scary because it has a few, it's just kind of weird. Then more lights started to go out and we're still shopping like nothing's going on. There was still plenty of light coming in the windows. But then by the end of this dream they were playing, ""What can wash away my sins? Nothing but the blood of Jesus."" And, of course, she loved that. And then finally, when I was about to wake up, we were going, we could go down an escalator that was more in the light, but for some reason we decided to go down a stairwell that in the dark, and it was at the end of the store where the lights had gone out. So I remember just, and I wasn't really afraid in this dream. I was just sort of taking my time, you know, as I do, feeling for the railing and holding onto it with both hands. And then I woke up."
"D-042"	"#D-042 (2011-01-08 (25)) I was at Central Lutheran and I was watching Mikhail play the organ. And they had a white floor, and kind of reddish pews, which they really have. And the white floor had no carpet. And there was somebody up in the loft. And Pastor Gregg was there. And there was this woman archbishop who was guest speaking, and she reminded me of something out of Prairie Home Companion. It was like a really solemn day. She was just really flippety flippety, and I thought to myself, ""Oh gee, this isn't going to bode well for Pastor Gregg ________________ and things."" And she was in a red kind of a flowery pink dress and the thing of it was, is that the organ was playing itself because Mikhail was, he had this mini sequencer thing that he could call up on it, and somebody said that they wanted to hear ""Phantom of the Opera"" so Mikhail made the organ play ""Phantom of the Opera."" [laugh] And then there was something else, and the organ played some other goofy out-of-place song. And I was sitting in the back with Marilou and two other of her friends, and Mom was there too. She was supposed to pick me up. But for some reason I just sort of followed Marilou and her two girlfriends. And they were getting on a bus, so I got on a bus with them. And I asked them, ""Well, where is this bus going?"" And they were like, ""Oh, it's going to a tanning salon in Bayfront."" And I said, ""I don't want to go to a tanning salon."" And Marilou said, ""Well no, the bus is going and my college is another state."" I think it was Virginia or something. And so it seemed like there was only a _____ on that big bus, and so the driver was kind enough to pull off at the first exit that we'd come to, which was just after US 19, I think. And so I had to call Mom on the cell phone. I was sitting at like this little rest area park thing at a picnic table, and I was calling Mom and telling her where I was. And she said, ""Okay, no problem, I'll be right there."" And then I woke up."
"D-043"	"#D-043 (2011-01-10 (25)) I was at the beach with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and they had some other kids with them too. And it must have been Oceanside Beach, I think. We were swimming around and playing in the water. And I was noticing that where it was shallow there was a lot of shells and poky barnacles and things, and it wasn't really that smooth at the bottom. And so we went deeper, but I wanted to stay close to them. And then they said they wanted to go and do something else. They had a dog or something they were going to walk. I think it was like a beige-ish-brownish dog, kind of like the dog Tiffany that Sandra used to have. And so they went to do that, but I said I was going to swim so more, so I did. And then I got out of the water and I went into the like the little beach house thing to use the restroom. And I was walking around and I was wanting some food, and I went to this vending machine where you put cash in the machine and you get like a card, like a gift card that has like a plastic with money on it. And when mine came out, it wasn't like a credit card like you expect; it was like a mini CD. And I thought to myself, ""What am I going to do with this? Who would take this?"" And then I thought it might be time to reconnect with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, so I called them on my phone, but and then I realized at that time I was totally naked, and I was like walking down the beach or running down the beach, kind of covering my chest. And I sat on the bench for a minutes kind of waiting for them. And I figured, ""Well, I'm not going to sit out here totally naked. I'm getting back in the water."" So I did, and then I woke up."
"D-044"	"#D-044 (2011-01-23 (25)) I was in an elementary classroom as a teacher's aid, and it must have been a Christian school because we were talking about what sounded like it was the ""Acts of the Apostles,"" but they were calling it ""The Journey of the Early Christians"" or something odd like that. And they were talking about different stuff. And these kids were supposed to make posters about something like that, or going to a country and being a missionary. And I was supposed to make one, like as a model, to show them how they're supposed to do it, and it had this border, it had this square within a square, like a frame almost, drawn on the posterboard. And I had colored it orange and I was taking a big fat marker and I was trying to draw around the frame and make it like a 3D look, you know how you put a black on a side and then at the bottom to make it look like there's a shadow? Well, I was doing that on the bottom and the left to make it look like the light was coming from the right, and as it turned out, instead of a line, it turned out to be this big blob, and this really, really, really heavy line that was like running off the page, and it did that at the bottom too. And I was thinking, ""This is just so terrible. I feel like I really messed it up."" And Mom was there, and she was like, ""Oh no, you didn't; oh no, you didn't. You to finish this up. You have to keep drawing this. You have to keep doing this."" And I said, ""No, I'm not going to keep doing this."" She said, ""You have to finish this up; you have to keep doing this and you have to use this one."" And I said, ""No, it's the worst thing I've ever drawn in my life."" And we got into this shouting, I was shouting at her and she was shouting at me, and she was trying to cover my mouth and I bit her hand. And then I snatched the poster and I ripped it up. And then I woke up. "
"D-045"	"#D-045 (2011-02-24 (25)) I was going to be in some kind of movie or some kind of school play, and I think I was at home with Mom."
"D-046"	"#D-046 (2011-02-28 (25)) I was going to study at Modern Media College and Mom and I were driving to Centerville ___________, and we were going to get set up. For the first two months I was going to study in Westportrsburg and have online classes there. And for the next month I was going to an apartment to stay over there. And then we would see what happened after that. This neighbor of mine to the west, she was helping me and advising me on which apartment to pick and stuff like that. And as Mom and I were driving down there, I think that for some reason when we got there, Mom parked kind of crooked when she went to go do something else. And I think I tried to move the car so that it wouldn't be crooked, and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to move it without risking doing serious damage, in other words running into something. [laugh] Let's see; what else? I think that we were staying overnight in this apartment, and it was kind of really little, and I'm trying to remember. I think maybe it was the next door neighbor who walked me to the school and then next thing I know, I was home and I was in Keith's front yard and there were a bunch of people dressed up with like Alice and different things, and I looked in one of the rooms ______________________. _____________________ set up ______________________. And then I woke up. Keith really did go to Modern Media College, and Saturday I went up __________ Fine Arts. No, I was in Great Explorations __________ and they were doing the Mad Hatter's Tea Party and everybody was dressed up like Alice In Wonderland."
"D-047"	"#D-047 (2011-03-01 (25)) Samantha, Sandra and Derek had come to town, and I think it was Christmas time because we were going around looking at everybody's lights. And they took us to this one house that I think was their house. It had a horse puppet that was really big, and it was like t_____ things and it was like a marionette puppet tied to the roof and it was automated so they were saying how they would have liked to give it some more moves, but it would have really cost them. I guess the people who put it up there charged an arm and a leg for the moves that it could do. And then I was upstairs with Mom and we were trying to vacuum and the vacuum cleaner was like bizarre. It was instead of being loud and normal, it was quiet and the motor was turning like extremely slow. And I thought, ""Jeepers, what's up with this?"" And also in this dream my sink was dripping like crazy and I was beside myself because I didn't know what to do about it and I'm very conscious about not wasting water. I always feel kind of beside myself when I notice that it's dripping. I think that's all there was to it."
"D-048"	"#D-048 (2011-03-07 (25)) I used to take a lot of rides with Merrilee and Corinne in their car, and for some reason _______ it needed fixing. And for some reason they wanted me to pay for it. And they were going to, for some reason they dropped me off at some strange intersection and they went on their way. And they said, ""You can go to the shop for us and let them know we're coming and tell them all about it, okay?"" And I said, ""Sure."" And I kind of wandered around aimlessly, not knowing where I was going for a few minutes, and then I got it in my head that I could work with my binocular at street signs, and I had the address on a card that they had given me. It was an AMCO shop and it was at 50-something, and I was on 49th Street, so I knew I had to go one over, and sure enough, there it was. So I went in and I told them that Merrilee and Corinne were coming, and then for some reason Mom met me at the shop because I didn't know how I was going to get home and there she was; she showed up. And next thing I know we were walking and walking and we ended up at Damon's Landing and there's this park and we were walking down the boardwalk, and first we came through like a restaurant, and on stage there was some music, and there was like a one-man band who had like a drone ____ and a guitar, and Mom said he was in a parrot costume, like a parrot___. And I was kind of hungry. I wanted us to sit down and eat at the shop there because I was looking out and there was like a fence and we could see the blue, blue water. And we kept walking down the boardwalk and there were these steep inclines you'd walk down. And then we came to these stairs where we could walk down to the water, and we walked down and we stood there. And it was just really blue and it smelled really nice and wonderful. And there were other people swimming. And in this dream I was wearing jeans and some kind of long-sleeve shirt, and I thought, ""Well, gee, if I was wearing less clothes, I would jump right in."" And I said to Mom, ""You have to tell me where Damon's Landing is in relation to the other things I know,"" and she said, ""It's more southern."" We walked a little more and I said, ""You need to tell me where it's at in relation to other things,"" and she said, ""I don't think so; I don't want to."" And that made me really mad, and I got the drift because she said it was southern that it was near Mid-town and she didn't want me to go there, and she didn't want to say it in front of all these people. That made me so mad, I wanted to push her in the water. And then I woke up. Also I'm remembering something that came before this whole thing, before I woke up to go to the bathroom. I was back at Westport High School and I was in the food court, like the outside cafeteria thing and that you could just have a school play or something. And Mom came by and I was at, Mom was going to come by on the tandem bike and pick me up, but I was standing around talking to Susan and Hayleigh and a couple other people, and they were going to go for a ride downtown. And they were going to just sort of hang around and get to town and have a night on the town. And I was wondering about whether or not to just say I would go with them and get Mom to go back home. But while we were waiting, they were saying some really horrible things about these people they knew and what they did and, you know, how they were going to get drunk and stuff like that. And I figured I just wanted to get away from them, so next thing I knew, Mom showed up and I don't really remember riding home. I just remember being home, being so scared, and laying with her in bed and thinking to myself how much I really didn't want to be out on the town with Susan and Hayleigh getting into all kinds of trouble. And then I woke up."
"D-049"	"#D-049 (2011-03-28 (26)) I have been having lots of little fragmented little stupid dreams lately that don't really have much substance, but are kind of isolated little whatever you'd call them. A couple of them, actually the night before last I dreamt that Mom had the vacuum cleaner up on the third level and she was trying to vacuum something and the vacuum cleaner motor was revving like the car motor would if it was in park and you stepped on the gas. And the vacuum cleaner motor was just going faster, faster and faster and I was saying to Mom, ""Unplug it; unplug it"" and it turned out it would do that revving business when she would lean on something. And there wasn't really that much to that one, and then last night I had this dream that was kind of a hodge podge. First I was down in Demon's Landing again walking on this platform thing, and then Mom and Dad and I were in the car and we were riding around. And we were like going on the Interstate and it was almost like a roller coaster. I was hanging onto their arms and hanging onto the doors. It was like a crazy ride. And then, next thing I knew, I was driving and I was just sort of toodling down the street, hoping I was in the right lane. It was almost like I wasn't really doing that much. It was just happening by itself, and I was sort of trusting that it would happen and I was pretty scared when I woke up because I really wanted to get wherever I was going, and I was determined to get there. But I was just sort of thinking, ""Gee, just trusting that everything's going to happen."" And then I dreamt that I was at Jungle Park and I had this dream before that I'm at Jungle Park and I'm wandering this crazy maze-like-type thing. But this time people were saying that there was a place you could go, and it had like a blues exhibit where there were several pianos and you could jam, and you'd go up a stairway in the gift shop and you'd come out on a balcony, and that's where it is. And that's where I was supposed to go. And I kind of got lost, but then I found it, and then I woke up."

And I knew that there would be a fire drill scheduled in the afternoon when I was in that class, but I had some homework that I really needed to turn in, so I went to this elevator. It was this really rickety elevator that wobbled and wobbled as you went up. And I was really scared in that elevator. But I got up to the class and took out and handed in my stuff and there was a substitute teacher and I just told her __________ schedule. And I need to already be outside so that I don't get lost in the shuffle. But it was close to the time change and my clock hadn't been changed an hour later, so I kept having to adjust in my mind and I was like doubting myself. And then I finally grabbed my books and ran down the stairs a few minutes before it was supposed to be 2:30. And I think I just went up to the lawn in the front of the school and sat down, and then I woke up."
"D-051"	"#D-051 (2011-04-12 (26)) I was going to a carnival for students who were graduating from Westport College, and it was outside kind of like at a park or something.

And I showed it to them and they said it wasn't the thing that she said, and the main said, ""Well, just go on in."" So I went in and I was walking around. I think I was by myself. I don't remember too much about what I saw around the place, but I do remember one of the features was a carousel and there weren't many people getting on it. And because there weren't many people getting on it, it wasn't really _______. And he just got on a horse, and I think he did something -- I don't know what -- he did something to just start the whole thing. And he'd be riding on this horse and there were controls to make the carousel music louder and softer, and I remember that once I got on, some other people got on, and the horses were kind of ugly compared to usual carousel horses.

"D-052"	"#D-052 (2011-04-15 (26)) I was taking a math class again. I don't know why this keeps coming back to me. But for some crazy reason it was like a catechism almost, and I was filling out a PBS online that was the homework. It was a worksheet all about Easter and stuff. And it was asking questions about the Easter story. And one of them that I can remember is, ""Do you think that the spirit __________"" or something like that. And then last night I had a dream that I was going to sing __________ play a clarinet or something. And the only scene that I remember was that I was sitting at a school desk, studying a musical score and trying to write __________________. And I was thinking how I didn't know much about how to play the instrument and how to _______________ to make the notes ________________, but for this to come out of the music and sing it and the teacher will think ____________________. ___________________."
"D-053"	"#D-053 (2011-04-16 (26)) I was at St. Paul's for Easter. Now for some reason in this dream the sanctuary was this great big round rotunda with a wooden floor and big windows and curtains; no stained glass windows, just plain old, big old windows. And instead of pews, we were all sitting in chairs, kind of in rows. And the organ loft is up in the back and there was like a stage almost instead of an altar, kind of like one of these mega churches would be. The AGO calls them Big Box Churches, I guess. And I was there with somebody with dark hair. I kind of half thought it might be Marilou, but I kind of thought it was Sandra. And I was kind of thinking maybe it was Samantha, even though Samantha has light hair in real life. I kind of feel like it must have been Samantha because I had a feeling it wasn't somebody really religious, but was just kind of there. And I was just kind of observing, and I was listening to the organ, and I was hearing the organ playing really loud and I wasn't hearing people sing too much because people don't really sing that much, I guess. And I was hearing the priest go on and on, and they were doing their different readings and things, and then everybody was going up to the stage/altar all in a big line. I think that there were lots of children who were getting baptized or first communion or something, but they were all in colorful outfits. They weren't wearing white. And then the priest was giving a sermon. I don't even remember any words. It was just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he had a lot of the mannerisms of Pastor Gregg and he was all in white. And then the organ played again and I kind of turned around when the organ was playing, and I looked up there and I could see some pipes. And the organ, we were singing ""Rock of Ages,"" and just like when I sing in church for real, I could feel my voice more than I could hear it. And so I could feel my voice resonating, and I was singing my heart out because I was so glad they picked one that I know the words to. And for real I really am happy when I finally hear a tune that I know the words to because, as much as I have been in church the past year, I still don't know many of the words to the hymns because people don't enunciate very well when they sing, and I don't take the time to stay; I want to go home. So in my dream I was, they didn't even have a post ______. The just did the last hymn and then everybody got up and for some reason I was wearing a vestment, like for a choir. I was singing like out in the congregation, but I was wearing a vestment. And when I got up, I not only lost the bottom of my vestment, but I lost my pants too. [laugh] Then I was running around with no pants and a bare butt, and everybody was like, ""Oh my God, oh, my God!"" And this one lady who was like an elder there, like one of the ladies like Judy from Central Lutheran, she was like, ""Oh, Honey, you can come with me."" I was kind of running around like a chicken without my head because I didn't know what to do. I felt like people were going to like nab me and kick me out or something and I didn't know which way to run. But this lady was like, ""Oh, Honey, you can come with me."" And she took me to this back room and she gave me this purple ticket that would allow me to go into the donation closet and pick a pair of clothes, or at least a pair of pants or something. [laugh] And so I picked these purple shorts with sparkly jewels on them, and I put them on, and then I woke up. That was crazy, wasn't it? But actually, to think about it, I think this might be because I might not be buying everything they say all the time, I don't take everything so literally as they do, and sometimes I have my own ideas and I wonder how it might be if they ever found out what was really in my heart. [laugh] This running around with no pants thing is probably about that. "
"D-054"	"#D-054 (2011-04-18 (26)) Was I was at a lesson with Mr. Dawson. And I was trying to play ""Thine Is the Glory,"" and I was getting all messed up because, I don't know, I just wasn't playing the right notes and he was saying, ""Well, I think you should do more ear training. I think maybe your audeation is not quite up to par."" And, you know, he was saying that in a pedagogical manner, you know, just sort of a normal thing that needs improvement. And meanwhile people in the music center were bustling around and bustling around and bustling around, getting ready for the musical show Rent, which I think we're going to go and see. And he was a bit perturbed because they were making all kinds of commotion while we were trying to do a lesson. And somehow I went, was away from the organ, and the stage was like this huge, you know, one of those blow-up raft things that was a major incline, and somehow I realized I was sliding backwards down the incline and I was yelling for help. And one of the crew members managed to pull me back up on my feet, so I wasn't sliding backwards any more. And so then I was back over by the organ and the bench was kind of high so I could hardly reach the pedals, and we were doing something. I don't remember what we were doing. But I realized I was stark naked, without a stitch of clothes on me, and I thought, ""Oh gee, I hope Mr. Dawson will forgive me of this and not think it was too odd,"" or whatever. And there was a photographer coming to take pictures of the set and all for Re__, and kind of very professional. And Mr. Dawson just kind of stood behind me and covered me up while the photographers took pictures and everything, and was talking and going on with things as usual, and kind of reaching over my shoulders and playing a little bit, like he does sometimes, just the most chivalrous, the most professional thing -- just covering me up until the photographers left. And then I woke up."
"D-055"	"#D-055 (2011-04-19 (26)) I was on the trampoline with about seven or eight other kids that were preschoolers or maybe kindergarteners, I don't know for sure, but I think they were preschoolers. And we had the ""Wee Sing"" tape playing, and we were playing all the singing games and the circle games. And we were having so much fun, and there was no fear, no anxiety. Whenever I've dreamed about that tape in the past, there's always been something. And this time it was just so different. It was really, really nice. And I had Mom's little hand-held flat tape machine that sounded so terrible. It was on the bunny cage, just like she would put it, and when we were all done with that, we were like, ""Okay, that was over."" And I flipped the tape over and there was some kind of country yodeling or something on the other side. And then all of us were kind of jumping on the trampoline, and the next thing I knew, I was like jumping on a bed or a couch. I think I was jumping on a couch, and I realized there was somebody sleeping there and I didn't want to wake them up. And then I woke up."
"D-056"	"#D-056 (2011-04-23 (26)) I was at a school doing some observations on ______ and stuff. I was supposed to call someone by a certain time and a certain day to see if I could get a ________ation. Mariah Carey was coming to town and she was going to sing at some little restaurant somewhere. And they needed somebody to do what I thought was to run a teleprompter with the song words so that she wouldn't forget them. And I was thinking that I would be able to, I wasn't really sure if I would be able to do that, but I was thinking I might. And so I was at this school and it was kind of like Oceanside. And I was going around to the beautiful classrooms and the teachers were showing me what materials were needed, and I intended to call this person on my lunch hour. But as it turned out, I was busy all day long [?] and I was supposed to call them at 3:00 and it's closing to be almost 5:00, so I was pretty bummed out that I missed that. But then next thing I knew, I was looking at the AGO website and it said if you still want to do this, contract so and so, but as it turned out, it was going to be, she was going to perform at this person's church. And the choir was going to sing back-up for her. And they wanted more than someone just to run the teleprompter. They wanted somebody to transcribe the stuff in the recordings, like I didn't know if she wanted just the back-up vocal parts transcribed, or if she wanted the whole thing, like all the instrumental parts __________, so I was ready to ask that and then I woke up."
"D-057"	"#D-057 (2011-05-16 (26)) I was at a school that was kind of like Westport High School, but I felt like it was a college. It was during the summer and the type of activities that were going on were like a college orientation, but there were young kids there and I was kind of a young kid. And I think there were kind of middle teenagers, like 15 and 16 years old, and most of them were girls. And I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there too. And we were on this playground. And it was a big, huge, tall playground with equipment for teenagers, like monkey bars that were really, really, really tall and stuff like that. And I was kind of involved in some kind of a hazing thing, I guess it was, now that I look back on it, in order to get into this whatever I was trying to get into. This group of girls was going to do something really odd. They would throw me up in the air and I would throw around and throw around and throw around and I would come down and I would hit this mat. And when I would come down and hit the mat, there was going to be this terrible, terrible, awful, awful, really really loud sound that would be triggered. And so I think I had________ or something, and I did -- I swirled all around and when I came down, it was just sort of like I floated to the ground and nothing happened. And the sound thing didn't work, fortunately. And I can remember doing a monkey bar thing and hoping that I wouldn't fall. And I was climbing to the top of some of this really, really tall teenage equipment. And somebody pushed me off of one of the things, and again, I kind of flew threw the ground and that time when I hit the mat, nothing happened either. But then they were kind of starting to chase after me, and Mom was there, and by that time it was almost dusk. And we were like running to the car because they were chasing after me, and when Mom and I got in the car, the car wouldn't start, but she just kind of put it in neutral and was able to get it going and kind of steer it a little bit. And we kind of were bumbling our way off into the night, and before I knew it we were home. And then I woke up."
"D-058"	"#D-058 (2011-05-22 (26)) Another problem dream about trying to get into Central Lutheran. I dreamt that we were having some kind of function there, like a dinner or a fundraiser or a dance or something. And we were in a big hall that was kind of like the Coolidge Hall, except it had a wooden floor, it was kind of like a dance floor. And people could come in the sanctuary and come through to the hall, which is where we were. And the part that I remember the best is that it was time to leave and people were clearing out, and I was going to leave. And somebody opened the door at the back of the hall, but it was kind of leading to another hallway going to the office. Somebody opened that door and I could hear the beep beep beep, you know, that says that your time is running or you only have a minute to set off the alarm. So I ran as fast as I could, calling for Pastor Gregg, and eventually I got his attention. He came back to the back door and Shirley was there, I guess, and I guess Sheryl was there too. And they were diddling around and diddling around and diddling around, but they couldn't seem to get it shut off. So [laugh] I just sort of went to the middle of the hall and hoped that it wasn't going to be too loud. And, of course, we heard it and everything, and the company came out and police came out and it was all dark, like all the lights went out. And the company was telling us all this stuff about trying to help us get our act together, if you will, and not do that again. And then, next thing I know, we were in the sanctuary and somebody did that again where they opened the door and the time was counting, and somebody didn't bother to try to shut it off, either that or they couldn't. So that time I just ran around the building and I took off running down the street, through that neighborhood for a couple blocks."
"D-059"	"#D-059 (2011-05-28 (26)) I was up most of the night sniffing and snotting and whatever else because I just couldn't go to sleep, as stuffy as I was. So when I finally did go to sleep, I had this dream that was so very real, it was kind of scary. It wasn't really scary, but, you know, I dreamt that Mom and Dad had come back already and it was Saturday morning. I dreamt that, I don't know, I guess they just sort of showed up and I saw the truck out there, and I said, ""Well, why did you come back?"" and Dad said, ""Well, because I drive too slow."" And apparently that must have been what they were arguing about. And apparently also they had forgotten some things. Apparently there was thing that you would put your feet in and have them washed or massaged or something, and they had left it here at the house and they had intended to take it with them. So it was probably going to be a few days or more before they left. And I was really disappointed because it wasn't even really sure that they would leave again. And I was still, I went through a couple of phases where I would wake up and go back to sleep, and I couldn't really be sure that it was actually a dream until I really woke up and it was daylight. And I looked out the front and the truck wasn't there, and then I was really sure that it was a dream. And also I was having this other dream about being in the school someplace. And it actually kind of looked like the pier. Then I could be there for one or two classes and come home. And actually I didn't even really feel like I was attending any classes. But I was rolling around and they had this roof top place like the pier does, and like I understand the hospital does. And we were out there with a couple other students and there was a white board, and the students were writing what they would like to see, up there on the white board. And ______ were talking about a recording studio, and I just stepped back and thought to myself, ""Well, surely I won't get into it because they people will. These people are kind of h_____ people and they're like they're just going to hog it."" And then I dreamt that for some reason I was swimming in this indoor pool, and when I got out, I was naked. And I was kind of running around in a quasi locker room, and there was this guy in there and I was really embarrassed. And he was trying to help me find something, maybe some food or my clothes or the right place to go out or something. And then I woke up."
"D-060"	"#D-060 (2011-06-08 (26)) Actually we were riding around doing errands with Betsy. It was me and Mom and Dad and Betsy were all in the car, and there was someone else with us. And we were riding around to different stores and things, and it was time to get ourselves some food. And for some reason Dad knew of this van that would be parked by the police station, and this van would have like all kinds of food rations and little things that they give to prisoners. And for some reason, somehow, they were going to let us have some, if it was anything we really wanted, right? I mean, it was so, they had like little spools of thread and little socks, little containers of food and just diddly things in different drawers and things. And we got Betsy some things from there, and someone was telling us the story of this food that fell in the mud and how they took like thousands of bacteria processes and things and somehow cleaned it up, and they don't know what they did or how they did or if it was safe. They just know they did it. And next we _________ parking lot and for some reason there was a fire truck, and for some reason Dad had to move it. And he said something about, ""Go over to one side,"" like over around to the left, ""and go out of the parking lot and wait for me over somewhere else."" Well, for some reason, instead of going left, I went right, and he was backing the truck up. And I thought that he wanted us to get in the truck so that we could keep going. So I went around the back of the truck over to the passenger side, and I was so close to getting run over. The truck was like touching me, almost about to knock me over. It was moving slowly, slowly. So I just climbed onto the bumper for lack of a better way to say it. I just climbed onto it and hung on so that he could do all his maneuvering and I wouldn't get run over. And he kept turning it and stuff, and eventually I managed to tap on the door. And I don't remember what happened after that. I don't even remember us getting back in our car to go home. Then I woke up."
"D-061"	"#D-061 (2011-06-11 (26)) We were ___________ that was like ___________ but they had different names and neither one of them __________________, but they were real proud of me and ________________________ and they like __________________________. So _________________ _________________ on 7th Street. And I was kind of taking care of them. I think I was like -- oh, what should I say? -- I was ________ing up things around the house and I was helping to dress them or something. And they had an alarm, but somehow I was able to get in and out and just deal with it. They taught me how to shut it off. And the only thing was when I would leave, I wouldn't re-arm it. I would let their next caregiver to come and she wasn't __________________. And I really wanted to _____________________. I guess I really do miss the coming and going at ___________. The only time I was like afraid is when I was in the house and they weren't there for some reason. But they showed me how to look at it and make sure that it was off. And ___________________ a house alarm security system, but the settings were all dealt with on a panel that looked like an alarm clock, like one of those ones you find in a hotel room. That was kind of odd. I kind of think there was a whole lot more to these people. It was kind of a nice dream actually. We were talking and stuff. But I don't remember too much of it. Now the next one is kind of bizarre. We were at Disneyland, Mom and I, and it was one of those things where __________________________ and apparently Dad didn't really go on any of the rides, but he was out in the middle of the park where there was grass and trees and stuff, and he was just kind of like bored to death, kind of sleeping in the truck. We had the green truck this time. Now there were some things that were leading up to this, but I can't really remember _________. I just remember the really scary part. Mom and I were in the Bermuda Triangle ride, which it's like in a big auditorium and the floor just kind of moves this way and that, kind of makes you think you have to go somewhere. And we were kind of walking around. There was a whole lot of people there. And we were playing musical chairs and picking different seats. And Mom, I was little enough so Mom could just carry me. I must have been like a toddler because she could carry me comfortably. And then they made a big announcement that everybody had to get out, and there was a fire alarm. And it didn't actually sound like the fire alarm at school. It sounded like a very loud fire truck back-up alarm. So she was able to just grab me and scoop me up in her arms, and we were off. And there were just tons of ______ and tons of people trying to get out. I don't know where all those people came from because I didn't notice so many people when we were enjoying the show. And somehow they had people that were directing the traffic and we were able to get out. And when we got out __________, and I can remember just feeling really, really scared after that. And Mom was like, ""I'm going to put you down, I'm going to put you down,"" and then eventually she did, but I said, ""I ____________ if I'm getting heavy, you can put me down, but I'm not letting go of you for anything."" And then the next little scene was that -- oh, I know -- we were out at the green truck and Dad was talking to somebody about it, and a lot of the hardware on the back near the bumper, like there was some p____ and things and there were a couple of other things that were for towing, and a lot of hardware was all made out of chocolate. So when you had a hankering for chocolate, you could just go to the back of the green truck and get some. And for some reason Mom and I were going up this tower because apparently we wanted to take the green truck up there for some crazy, crazy reason -- I don't know why -- and it was kind of like Tuck's Tunnel at Great Explorations, which I've never been there, except there was a light on and it was all white instead of all dark. It was like there was light and there was like white carpet on everything, so you were in a white nothingness. And we crawled and we crawled, and at first it was fine, and then Dad and I, we turned, we were going higher and higher, we were just crawling and crawling up the slope. And then we turned and it got like almost too tight to go any further. And I got kind of off ____________. And Dad said, ""Well, you just have to go about it the right way,"" and he got kind of a little stuck too and he had to kind of go out the other way. And we went the other way and there were like these doors that led -- we thought they went out to some kind of stairs that go down to the outside, but they led to this observation deck, which was kind of, there were tables and there were _____ and there was this wrought iron railing and stuff. And we asked somebody ___________ the stairs back ____________. And I was kind of afraid to go down the stairs because of what happened at the other place. I'm trying to think, did I ever come down? I don't think so. I think I was on the observation deck and then I woke up."
"D-062"	"#D-062 (2011-06-19 (26)) I was having kind of an odd dream last night, although it wasn't really all that odd, considering everything that's been going on in my life. I dreamt that I was in a hotel room and I was at an audio work station with a computer screen kind of far away, and there was a typing keyboard and there was a musical piano keyboard. And they were both on the same sliding tray. And I was blasting some kind of rock and roll music and playing along on the keyboard, and I had it the level of mix so that I could hear my playing even louder than the blasting music. And I was jamming out and playing the records and everything, and then I realized that there were two or three other girls in the same room that were hearing all of this, and it was really late at night. And I apologized to them because I was really probably keeping them up. And they said, ""Oh no, that's okay."" And somebody called up the stairs that Mom had come for me. Now I don't know how or why, but somehow Uncle Larry and Aunt Christine were involved here somewhere. And apparently I was staying somewhere until they could get me, and they came to get me. And I was trying to pack up a whole bunch of stuff in my bags because it was like suddenly I had to get up and go. And I was packing like computer speakers and like crayons and books and just a whole bunch of bulky stuff that people wouldn't normally take on a trip, I was packing in my bags. And I was thinking, ""How am I ever going to carry all this stuff around?"" And I can remember doing the scene kind of like typical, where there are these stairs and they're kind of steep, and you go up and it's a dead end and you get really claustrophobic or something. And it was one of those kind of scenes in Grammy's house, but I can't really why or what or anything. And then I was feeding chickens back here at the house. There were two of them. There was a red, a Rhode Island Red, and there was a B¬¬______ Ch______. I forget the official name of B_____ Ch_____ r_____, but I think you know what I mean. And it was another one of those dreams where we had them for a while and I had been forgetting to feed them and I felt so awful, and I didn't know how long they had been here and I had forgotten to feed them. And apparently they were doing okay because they scratched around and found bugs and stuff, but I was doling out cracked corn and bird seed to them, and the B____ Ch____ chicken was kind of half blind, and we had a Rhode Island red that was kind of half blind, but this chicken wasn't getting the idea that I had food for them, and I was trying to get her to eat some and she wouldn't. She kept running away. And she kept just kind of wandering around. And finally she went in the garage and was eating little bits of my hand. And then, as I was starting to wake up, I was having this other scene where the dream was the dream world was not really a place in the mind, but it was an actual other dimension place you could go to. And I was kind of thinking in my dream that if I carried Big Bird to the dream world, then other people in my dreams would see him and I would be kind of _______. And in this scene I was kind of walking around in a living room at a big party, and I was carrying him, and there were all these different people that were talking. And then I woke up."
"D-063"	"#D-063 (2011-06-20 (26)) I was going to a conference of the National Federation of the Blind, and it could have -- you know, when I think about it, it could have been the _____ or it could have been a theater organ conference. I really don't know for sure. ______________ and apparently I had to leave from Eastport and fly to Charleston and then I made a connection in Charleston and then I would come back home, back to Southport, I think, because it was in the southern part of the state. And I would rather do all that flying rather than ride in a car all that way. But _______________ I didn't know what city it was going to be in. [laugh] And as it turned out, it was going to be in Honolulu, Hawaii, and so it was easy, yeah, the city was going to be Honolulu, Hawaii, but I had a feeling like the location was really down south, because I was in a taxi and we could drive there. And the taxi driver started going south and going and going, and I sort of didn't think I was going to go all the way with him, and he really didn't want to go all the way, because he said, ""Oh, that bridge, oh, my God!"" But I was using the time to make some phone calls to figure out what the heck I was going to do, whether I was going to call Mom and Dad and have them come rescue me and say I had screwed up or whether I was going to call the people regarding the NSB or somebody was already going to be at the door _______. I don't know exactly how I solved this, but I think they gave me the name of somebody who was already going that way. And next thing I know, I was at the conference. And I don't know how or why this fed into it, but the city name of Honolulu reminded me of Lalalu, and I was hearing the version of Lalalu that was a duet between a man and a woman. And that was kind of weird. So I got the house. This conference was actually at a house, and this is what makes me think it was a theater organ thing, because there was a great, nice, nice piano and there were two organs, and they were electronic organs, but they had this little pedal board like mine has. And they were decent, they weren't old analog, you know; they weren't the funny ones. And this lady was there and we were sitting at the piano and we were getting ready to do a duet, and _______ -- bless his soul -- was being so rude. He was butting in and waving his own music, and talking over us and just really, I don't know, just being rude. And then the conference was starting, and someone was starting to speak and _____ King didn't want to sit down and be quiet. So the lady who was doing the piano duet with me and two other people kind of like herded him and escorted him into another room. And then I woke up."
"D-064"	"#D-064 (2011-06-25 (26)) I was at Modern Media College for a guest performance. I don't know how I got to Centerville, but I think I took a DART cab all the way. [laugh] What do you know about that? Speaking of cabs, I actually took a cash cab to work today because I forgot to set another one. I was all wigged out yesterday. [laugh] So anyway, I took a DART cab all the way to Centerville in this dream and I was at Modern Media College and I was sitting in the coffee shop and having dinner with somebody really, really famous, I don't know who. I don't really have any kind of a name __________. It wasn't anybody whose name I would recognize. And he was just kind of making small talk before the presentation, and he was saying how overwhelmed he was by everybody wanting him to hear this stuff. And somehow I took to talking to him, I don't know, I'm just special that way. I have a way to draw people in sometimes, probably because I'm so precocious, probably more than I should be. So we started talking and I started blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all about me and stuff. And he kind of seemed to like talking to me, so we talked a little bit. And he said, ""Well, you seem so enthusiastic. Why aren't you doing it now?"" And I said, ""Well, first of all, I live in Westport,"" and I said, ""If I were up here, I would doing it more, but I'm in Westport,"" and I told him all this stuff my parents say and how they kind of pooh-poohed the whole thing, and how they're, you know, kind of gave them a little bit of a sob story which is very unprofessional of me. And then he started talking about other things and how I could eventually maybe get back to it, and I said, ""I know the theory really well in my head, I know about ______ _____. The problem for me is finding out how to make the teeny piece of equipment do what it's supposed to do in a timely fashion."" And he said, the whole rest of the crowd got there, and it was like time for me to stop talking and pull back and let someone else in. And the next scene flipped to when we were done with the presentation -- apparently the whole thing was in the coffee shop. It didn't look like the one that I remember, but the floor was white, so it must've been the one I remember. The one I remember was like in the back of a building and it was really, really open and airy. And this one was kind of closed up like a little store front shop. So it was after the presentation and he said, ""Well, how are you getting home?"" And I said, ""Well, I don't know. I'm thinking I'm going to have to call my parents."" And for a minute he kind of did a ________ and said, ""Well, why would you have to do that?"" And it just seemed odd. Sometimes Dad says the most odd things at the most odd times. So he said, ""Well, let me call my wife real quick."" And he made this call and he was talking a little bit, and then he said, ""Well come on, let's go."" And I can't remember how it happened, but I think we were walking, and he said, ""Well, I could use _________ in the house anyway because I've got paint fumes coming up from the floor"" or something. I think he meant to say that he was having painting and all kinds of stuff going on at his house. So for some crazy reason, I don't think I even called home, but Mom showed up, of all things. And she's like, ""Well, come on, Jess, let's go."" And I said, ""Well no, I'm going to ride with so and so,"" I can't even remember his name. He's really famous, he's a sound _____. I want to ride with him and I want to have more of a report."" And Mom said, ""Well, you don't really know him,"" and this and that and the other, and I just had the biggest hissy fit you can ever imagine. I was, once I got the drift that she thought she had to save me from that situation, I let loose. I was yelling and screaming and running after her, and trying to throw things at her. I threw, when we were having this scene, we were at a park. I'm starting to remember it better now. I think this sound man and I were walking in the park to get to his car, and I said that I remembered that park because it looked like one of the ponds at my complex. So we were at this park and Mom and I were fighting and having our fits. And I threw my phone and my purse in the pond, and then I just threw myself on the ground and was rolling down the hill, and I knew I wasn't really going to go too far too fast, but I was. And then I was walking in the shallow water, and then it was nightfall and then I kind of -- actually I think I was at home when night fell. Somehow I got home. I must've ridden home anyway, and I didn't know where my phone or anything was, probably because it was still in the lake! [laugh] But I realized that I needed to call Modern Media College and let -- I think his name was Nick -- I needed to let Nick know that I got home, but that I still wanted to talk to him some more sometime. And so that he would know that he didn't have to wait for me any more, and that I didn't drop off the face of the earth, and apologized to him for the whole thing. So I realized that I couldn't call 407 on a land line because we don't have long distance any more, and I was messing it all up and not really doing the right thing, and in this dream I couldn't even call the 1-800 number for Admissions. I used to be able to call the 1-800 number for Admissions and they'd transfer me to whatever department I asked for because when I first got there, I didn't memorize the new number for a while, so I would just call the Admissions number. So anyway, I didn't talk to anybody, but a while later I heard this ringing and ringing and I followed my ears and I found my cell phone and I answered it. And the lady said, ""It's a Pissa (?)"" and she said it was a lady from the desk at Modern Media College. And I was just starting to tell her about what happened and to apologize and pass the message to Nick for me. And then I woke up. Oh, how frustrating, and how tiring!"
"D-065"	"#D-065 (2011-06-25 (26)) I can't believe how this summer is flying by. I was having some dreams last night. The first was like I was going to get on a plane to go to Jackson to stay with Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and Mom, and it was going to be kind of like old times, and I was getting excited. But the thing was, that things got all goofed up because ____________ that I put things off and I was running around at the last minute, and I was packing and stuff. And I didn't get to the airport until like a little _____ before. And it's funny, this airport was really, really different. It was like an old _______ building. But I felt like I knew my way around it really well, all by myself. And there were all these rooms, but there was only one gate where planes would take off. And, you know, it kind of looked like the old hotel across the street that got knocked down where the town homes are now. It was like walking around in there. It was totally deserted. There were windows letting lots of light in, but there were no electric lights. There was like b______ concrete floors and old scraps of junk laying around. And there was this old rickety elevator that you couldn't really even know if it was going to work or not, and there was a regular stairwell. So what you had to do in order to get to the place where planes took off, was you have to go up to the third floor, which I did. I was able to go on the regular stairwell. And then there was this little room you had to go in, like Mom's crawl space almost, except you could stand up in it. And it was like a closet in Grammy's house actually. And then you had to climb straight up a little ladder, in total darkness, and I was pretty, I don't know why -- I shouldn't have had a problem with that -- but I was really afraid and I did not want to do that. I guess I didn't know how I was going to get my bags up there, and I don't know, it was just kind of scary. It was another one of those step dreams, I guess. And I was considering taking the elevator the rest of the way, but there were a couple other people around at this point and they said that the elevator didn't go that high, it only went to 3 and stopped. [yawning] Can you tell the rain kept me up last night? And so in the end, I think I missed the plane. I can't really be sure, but people were telling me they could see out the windows, you know, the truck that moves it sometimes. The truck that moved it was moving it, and it was pushing back and I didn't even get, I didn't have the, I was diddling around too much and I didn't have the nerve to finish that last leg of the journey to get out there to get on. And that was a real, real bummer. I didn't know what I was going to do. And then I woke up, fortunately, and heard it raining and was awake for a while. I was really glad, but awake nonetheless. And I went back to sleep, let's see if I can remember. Oh, I dreamt that I was playing with Erin. I was taking her to the park all by myself, and having to keep track of her. And she was older than she definitely is now, but she was like three or four and she was running around like Taylor does, and I was holding __________ keeping track of her. And she had a different voice and she was even speaking like Taylor. And she was climbing a tree and I was following her up it, and I was climbing it too. And I think I was wearing jeans and no top, and I got her back home. I had a wagon and then we were all going to go to some kind of a show. And I don't remember anything about that. "
"D-066"	"#D-066 (2011-06-29 (26)) it was Mom's birthday, and we were going to go to a museum or some kind of an art festival and we were riding two school buses _____________________. _________________________ We walked in this ________ and we caught a bus _________________ ___________ _________________. And I remember this one place where we went in a building and we had to go up an elevator to the bus station, up on a platform like a ramp sort of. And it's kind of where all the buses were stored, and it had nice brick ______________. And I remember when we were at this point, when we were on the elevator, we kind of lost Dad. So in the beginning we had all three of us, and then when we got to the bus station we were like running because we were afraid we were going to miss the bus, and we got in the elevator and Dad was still back in ______________. And I don't think we ever really caught up. Mom was, and then we got to the bus and Mom was kind of diddling around, and I was walking around and I was saying, ""Ho, ____________ bus 19."" And one of the drivers said, ""Oh, that's me."" And she came over to me and offered her arm, and I saw that there was nobody really on the bus when we got there. And I said, ""Well, I don't really have to get on yet. I just wanted to make sure I could find you and not miss you."" And she said, ""Well, _______________ yet."" Okay, _______________________. So we, Mom and me and this driver walked around for a little bit, and then I don't know if we ever got on the bus or not, but next thing I knew, we were in some kind of beauty shop and I can't remember, Mom was trying on clothes and I was trying on clothes. And I think we got our _________ or something. And the last thing about this dream is instead of riding the bus, I was in the park kind of walking some of the time, and some of the time I was sitting on this little raft with wheels, if you can believe it, pushing with my hands to get some momentum going, and then you're just rolling for a while. That was weird. I think I had this dream because yesterday I forgot to set up my cab for work, and in the morning I took a cash cab, and in the afternoon I called Keith from behind us and he didn't answer his cell phone, so I called the company again and ordered another cash cab, and waited for like an hour and the cab never came. There was one point when I saw the cab, I could have sworn I saw a cab go by in the parking lot, but before I could yell or get up or anything, he was gone from view, just like that. And so at that point, I thought, ""Well, he must have come around but was too stupid to see me waiting over here, and he didn't even come over here."" So then I called Keith again and that's when he answered his cell phone and I got to go home with him. And I heard buses going by, and I thought, ""Well, gee, I wonder if I could just go on the bus and go home."" And then I figured, ""Well, that wasn't such a good idea because I don't know where that bus is going. And I was thinking about how with a cab you just tell them what you want, easy to use and reliable, while riding the buses would not be fun."
"D-067"	"#D-067 (2011-07-01 (26)) First I think we were at the fire station and there was some kind of a dinner going on, like some times at holidays -- at Thanksgiving or Christmas -- we would come to the fire station and we would all kind of have dinner if Dad was on duty. Well, I got the feeling that this was like that, except it was in the middle of the afternoon, and there was some kind of awards being given out or something. And I had lots of work to do for various things, and they had set up an office for me there so I could be there by the paperwork. And I don't remember what exactly I was working on. Apparently I was trying to make some arrangements for early childhood music or something, it was this weird thing. There were two computers set up, a Mac and a PC, and somehow they were supposed to collect ______________________. And we were at the lunch table and somebody said they were going to be testing and working on the fire alarm, and I was like, ""Oh great."" And in this dream it was just like I was a little child. I was really nervous and jerky, and I tried to go back to the office and I was thinking to myself a little bit of what I needed to do next, and I said, ""I need to go outside; I'm just too nervous. I can't do this."" And then I actually, it was a good thing I went outside because I realized I was supposed to be somewhere else. I realized that I was supposed to be at this one school that I said I was going to do a music session at 3:00 o'clock and it was now 2:30, and I didn't set up a cab and I was here instead of home. So Mom and I got in the green truck and we took off, and I don't really remember being there in this dream. Next thing I knew it was the next day and it was my birthday. And I was going to have an early childhood music birthday, where I would, instead of my own friends, I would invite lots of families with young children and we would all do musical activities together. And it makes me kind of laugh when I think of it, because even though this would be fun for me in a classroom setting, I'm not particularly sure I would want to do it as my own birthday, although maybe I will someday, just because the understanding would have to be that the parents would definitely have to watch their kids because I would have no control and they would be running all over the house. And let me see, is there anything more? I can't -- oh, I know, just the only thing with that is that I was going to get people invitations on that very morning and then expect them to come later in the afternoon, which is kind of silly. And I think I was making a cake, and then I woke up."
"D-068"	"#D-068 (2011-08-02 (26)) Derek was in town and we were getting ready to go to Disneyland. And Dad wasn't going again. It was me and Mom and Derek. And at first I was thinking that I didn't want to go either because I was remembering the nightmare we had with the Morgan family. But as this kind of went along, I realized that I wanted to go too, that we'd probably have a lot of fun. And let's see, first of all, weirdest of all, I dreamt that our house had heat sensors and alarms like public buildings do, and if I colored with a marker or a crayon in the house, even on the porch, it would sound like a fire alarm in a public building was going off. So I had to be really, really careful and if I wanted to draw or color, I actually had to go out in the front yard. And I was making something that I don't remember what, and then I'm trying to remember what else. I think we were supposed to go to bed early so that we could get up early the next morning and get on the road, but Derek and Mom and I stayed up yakking and yakking and yakking all night pretty much, and I don't remember what we were talking about -- funny stuff, kind of ________________ and just kind of bonding, I guess. Now normally in the past couple years we wouldn't really know what to say that much, but here in this dream we seemed to have a lot to say. We were just kind of goofing around. Derek was laying on the couch, and I was sitting on him, like when I was a little girl, and we were kind of wrestling and playing and stuff, and Mom was on the sleeper couch. There wasn't an organ yet in this dream. And I think I showed Derek Big Bird and he really liked it, but then I remembered that Dad was sleeping in the bedroom and I had left him in the bedroom there because I thought that nobody was home, and I was just hoping that Dad wouldn't wake up and see him, but he did. And he woke up -- it was kind of like 5:00 o'clock in the morning, his normal time to get up, and I guess we had kind of been up all night, and he woke up and just sort of casually carried Big Bird out and put him on the sleeper couch and I was so embarrassed because I didn't want Dad to see him. And I was kind of, while Dad was in the bathroom, I was kind of talking to Derek about maybe he could convince Dad that it was his, and then I realized that Derek is probably under a lot more pressure to be grown up and manly than I am. So I don't really remember how that went. And then, let's see, and then I went upstairs and I was putting on orange tights like [laugh] they weren't really tight per se, but they were like knee-high socks and they were bright orange. And I was going to wear these goofy brownish shoes. And I was getting dressed to get out on the road, and then I woke up."
"D-069"	"#D-069 (2011-08-12 (26)) I had a silly, silly dream last night and there were lots of silly parts to it. But unfortunately I waited until late in the day to record it because I couldn't find my darned tape machine, and now only the first part is all I can remember. But I know there was lots of interesting stuff to it. It's kind of a bummer I can only remember this part. But I was in a movie theater and it didn't really have theater seats, but it had wooden chairs. And the front part where you stand in line, it was kind of a Disneyland thing where you have wooden sort of counters and wrought iron railing things and have to kind of walk in these big line things. And there were two people that were kind of like the owners, and they were like high school or college kids. And they were doing this thing where they were just opening their first plays and they were all excited and happy, and they were having like a grand opening where all their best friends come. And they were boys and girls. They were a bit like Melinda's family, I think, the way they acted and stuff. And I don't know, we were all in there milling around and somebody opened another door, and I heard the beep, beep sound, you know, the count-down sound like I hear at Central Lutheran. And I realized, ""Oh, my gosh, they don't even realize that they have to go to their piano and shut it off. I need to get out of here!"" So it was a typical scenario of realizing that I'm taking off running down the street the other way just like in every other crisis I'm in. And in this dream I had a towel wrapped around my head, which usually dulls sound quite a bit. And I was running across an intersection, and I was with the light, meaning that the traffic was only going parallel to me and the other ones were stopped. And there were some right turners going on right in front of me, and I actually had an experience like this a few months ago. And I stopped and I was like standing there in the middle of the street while three or four right turners went by, and then I got to the other side of the street and I was like, ""Phew!"" and I kept running. And I heard the time was up, but get this -- instead of hearing an alarm going off, I was hearing the Overture from Mary Poppins, you know, the very first feed the birds scene? And then there was the voice of Julie Andrews saying, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, if you don't leave, I will have to use the alarm. Okay?"" And then there was a chorus counting down like five seconds or something. And then, instead of a regular modulated sign wave, like a ""whoo whoo,"" it was almost musical. It was more like, ""Whoo ...... [going up and down"" kind of all over the place and it wasn't really -- I'm trying to think right now -- it wasn't really quite so loud because I had run so far, but I could hear it and it was just kind of crazy. How bizarre! How bizarre!"
"D-070"	"#D-070 (2011-08-14 (26)) I was having another one of those nights where I got a lot of sleep, but I kept waking up for some reason, and I had a lot of silly little dreams that I would remember each time I woke up. But now the only one I can remember is the most recent one, which was at a high school, I think. It wasn't any particular school that I remember being at, but it looked sort of like a school we went to when we were at a competition or something, kind of odd floors and walls that were kind of odd colors, kind of greenish. And I was, I can't remember why I was there. I had to take some kind of class again or something. It wasn't one of those dreams I would have sometimes about failing and having to go back, but it was more like I had some kind of official business, but I don't know what it was. And next thing I knew, I was back in Mrs. Dougherty's chorus, and there was this girl who was picked for a solo, and she sang most of the song and then we were going to sing after her, like at the very end. And the song was, ""Once more b_______ coming to ____________,"" and it was so gorgeous, and I was crying in my dream. I don't know if I had any real tears or not, but in my dream I did. And people around me thought I was crying because I didn't get the solo, but really it was so profound and it was so amazing to hear and to be a part of. And all I remember is just wanting to stay and wanting to be there, and not being able to make myself leave like I knew I should. And even, I remember she was going to go over certain passages and give us certain measure numbers and tell us about the things to focus on. And I remember just really wanting to hear all of that, and then I woke up. It was kind of a crazy thing.."
"D-071"	"#D-071 (2011-08-16 (26)) I was in the front yard and there were sprinklers all over. And they weren't really spraying at the grass like they were supposed to do. They were spraying at the sidewalk and they were spraying at me, and I was getting soaking wet. This is probably because I was hearing the rain outside. And I ran across the street and stood on the lawn of the condo-town home things and I realized they had sprinklers too, but they were kind of aimed the right way, and I was only getting a little wet over there. So then I went in the middle of the street and stood there a few minutes until our side went off. And then I came back to our side, and we had a pet turkey, a female, and she was sitting and sitting and couldn't lay any turkey eggs for us. So, get this, I was reading her a story and petting her to try to kind of calm her down and not make her so nervous and help her lay an egg. [laugh]"
"D-072"	"#D-072 (2011-08-16 (26)) Mom and Dad were home already. I wish I would quit dreaming those dreams about them being home, because that would only make them come home faster and I don't want that. I wish they'd stay until the end of October, maybe the beginning of November. And if they could do it and it wouldn't be hard or stressful for them, I'd say, ""Stay the winter, man!"" [laugh] So anyway, I dreamt that they were home and I still had some of my stuff scattered and strewn around down here, and I was trying to pick things up and put things in order. And the kitchen table was just a complete and utter mess. Mom had come home and put a whole bunch of baking and packing stuff out, and some of the things that I kept out were kind of a mess. For some reason I had left a couple of empty grocery bags, like the cloth ones we carry, and I left a couple of boxes and odd things around. And I left Big Bird on a kitchen chair, and people were walking by him and I was hoping that they wouldn't see him. And I was going to try to hurry up and take him upstairs, but Dad was in the bathroom doing his bathroom thing, and I didn't want to risk having him be seen. And so I just, I just laid him on his side and shoved the kitchen chair under the table, and covered a tablecloth around him, and thought, ""Okay, I'll wait until everybody's outside and then I'll take him upstairs. And then I woke up."
"D-073"	"#D-073 (2011-08-20 (26)) Mom was acting in a play at the Palladium, and I had the feeling that it was kind of like when she would do a dance recital, except she wasn't in a dance recital, it was actually acting in a play. I had no idea what the play was about or what her character was. I just remember being so excited for her and so thrilled, and I came along, and I remember being able to pretty much come and go as I pleased. The Palladium was about half full, there was some audience. So pretty much whenever I wanted, I could come out front and watch the play or go backstage and diddle around. I remember the backstage area was kind of a white floor instead of how it really is, and there were different dressing rooms and stuff. And I remember one time when I was backstage I was dancing with the other cast. We were holding hands and kind of line dancing. We were all backstage. And sometimes Mom and I would hang out backstage and she had a little while before she had to go on again. And then it was like an hour's worth of intermission, believe it or not. There was like a whole hour before the second half, and for some reason in my dream the Palladium was right next to the park, kind of where the baseball diamond is and where the t____ place is. So we got to walk around the lake and we were stopping at a water fountain sink-like type station to wash my hands and take a drink, I think. And for some reason she thought my face was dirty, so she was washing my face. And just about that moment there was a horrible horn honking and siren blaring going on, and she's holding by the face and she's washing my face, and I broke away and started running away. And as it turned out, it wasn't a fire truck or an ambulance or anything normal. It was some kind of a boat that was in the lake and it was from something called the Teddy Bear Foundation. And the Teddy Bear Foundation was apparently a halfway good organization that gave teddy bears the tour of the hospital, but they were also like Tea Party zealots, and what they were doing was they were staging a protest because they thought the Palladium wasted too much public money and was too much of a drain on society. And somehow I was able to jump in the lake and swim across the lake as a shortcut to actually walking around the rest of the lake. And then Mom and I walked through the place where the scoreboard is, where I used to hide in the bushes. We walked all through that area and cut across this field, and then we were able to get back to the Palladium on time, and I can't remember any more of that part, but I do remember the part where we got home and Mom and Dad were fighting as per usual, and Dad was kind of wondering, ""Well gee, what were you doing there all that time?"" meaning he knew that Mom was in a play, but what in the world was I doing there? Well, I told him that sitting backstage in the wings I could actually see the play better from instead of sitting out front further away, and, of course, that was baloney, but it sounded good to him. And I listed all kinds of books that I had with me to read and stuff. And then I woke up."
"D-074"	"#D-074 (2011-08-23 (26)) I have been having a problem __________________, a problem which I have never really had and I only really _______________________. But basically when I got my cleaning and my xrays from the college back in May, they had given me a referral to go to my dentist because they said that it looked like one of my fillings on the lower right was wearing out. Now wearing out, that doesn't really sound like it's a cavity or anything. So I said, ""Well, I'll just let it go; I don't want to go deal with that."" So now it's the end of August and in the past few days it has really been getting my attention, and I've been finding all kinds of ways to deal with it, like tipping my head sideways or having Listerine in my mouth for a while has done a pretty good job of numbing it for about an hour, not really numbing it, but making the pain going away. And ibuprofen doesn't really work that well, but I dug through the cabinet and I found _______________ does work, and I took it before John came and it worked like a charm all evening long. So I'm telling you all of this because last night I had a dream about teeth. And [laugh] I mean, that would stand to reason, right? There was something else going on, and I have really no clue what it was, which is unfortunate. I woke up in a ""blahhhhhh"" state of mind because in order to go to sleep with all those issues, I had to take a pill, which really made me feel like a dead fish in the morning. So I couldn't remember most of what I dreamt, but what I did remember was that I had lost several teeth. I mean, they just started getting looser and fell out, just like they did when I was little. And then the one on the right, which was bothering me, in my dream it finally came loose and fell out too, but what it was, was instead of a normal-sized tooth, it was a huge oval chunk thing, and I said, ""Well, how in the world could this be in my mouth?"" And as I held it and studied it and examined it, it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and it was like it's the weirdest thing. I mean, it was an old, old thing. It was almost like a picture frame and the outside perimeter was a little bit more raised than the middle, and the middle was sort of indented and kind of lumpy and bumpy, and it was kind of like one of the big molars in the back, I guess. But I looked it in the _______ and it had like all these colorful sparkly things in it, and it just sort of crumbled and it was falling apart in my hand and there was gooky stuff and it was the grossest thing ever, and it was kind of funny. And one thing ______________ because I was having a funny little memory of when I was about 10 and Samantha came in 1995 and _______________ for some reason kind of ___________ at the time. And I guess I was losing teeth or something, and Samantha said, ""Oh, I know, you're going to have a dream tonight that the tooth fairy is going to bring you an amplifier in the shape of a tooth, and it's going to blow you out of your bedroom."" That was funny."
"D-075"	"#D-075 (2011-08-28 (26)) I was in Jackson and I was with Grammy, and I don't know if Mom was there or not, but I was sleeping in a bed and it was morning time and she was vacuuming and she just opened my door and brought this vacuum cleaner in and it was so loud, and, of course, I didn't like the fact that she woke me up. So I tried to say something, but my voice couldn't be heard above the sound, so I got up and I was like waving her back with my hand and by the time she moved on to the next room, I wanted to make my point. So I hurried up and ran in the next room and was trying to show with my body how frustrated I was. And then the next thing was, there was a school that apparently -- I'm trying to think of the word -- I think it was called Writers L_____ University. And it wasn't a regular university, but it also had this other wing that was for young people, and it was kind of like Interlochen (?) in that it was for really talented arts people. And I don't know how I got there. I wasn't actually enrolled, but I was walking in the ________ and _____________ walk into some of the classrooms, and in one of them they were doing like animated projects and things. And this one girl had rigged a piano, like a prepared piano, except it was with electronic sampling, and she had this box full of CD's and she said they would allow her to play her favorite '90's songs. And the one she demonstrated for us was ""Paints"" (?) ______________ grown up in our family portrait we were pretty happy, let's go back to that. So the CD played like the background accompaniment and then she played the foreground sound, like on a regular like keyboard patch. And everybody was kind of like, ""Oh, I ____________, this isn't really anything very beautiful. Anybody could do that."" And there some other things; I can't remember exactly what they were. But I think for some reason there was a fire drill, I think. I don't really remember it that well. I don't remember rushing to leave the building. I just remember feeling pretty lost when I came back in. And everybody was kind of thinking that I was not following the right procedures. I don't go in the right line or I didn't do the right check-in or I didn't make the right handshake or something, and I felt like, I kind of felt like I was sort of pseudo enrolled ______ first day, and I was like, ""Well, I wish I would have known what the correct procedure to follow was."" And so apparently you had this paper that you overlaid over a calendar and you to cut out a little opening over the dates where this happened so that you could show that you were there for that day. I don't know of anything crazier. And then next the really bad part was that -- oh, and before I go to that, in this school one time I was walking down the hall and Garrison K________ was there reading one of his books and giving a lecture, and he was out in the hall and there were several students around him. So I went to go and listen to him for a while and then I kind of faded away after a while. Then I dreamt that I think I was in Jackson or something, and something really awful had happened to me and I was laying there with Mom kind of trying to discuss it. And I didn't remember it actually happening, but I remember kind of feeling intuitively like it did happen. And I was saying to Mom, ""Well, if it was real, then why don't I remember it?"" And she was saying, ""Well, if it was so horrible you repressed it."" And she was saying, ""We need to get you to a doctor and get you checked out"" and stuff like that. I was feeling kind of really funny about the whole thing, and I was crying in the dream, but there were no tears per se. And it took me a long time to just get kind of calmed down and all that sort of thing. I don't know where in the world such a bizarre thing could have come from. And I'm trying to think if that was the last thing that happened before I woke up, because when I woke up, I was so relieved that none of it was real. And there was one other thing that happened along the way. I was in the church and I was diddling around playing their organ and their choir was kind of warming up, and I thought that I could just sort of hang around, and then -- oh, and I was looking at a picture that was hanging from the music desk where they had tied it on. And was like a picture of a saint or somebody, but I couldn't figure out who it was. And then somebody leaned over and said, ""Hey, we're about to start. This isn't polite to be doing this when we're about to start."" And I said, ""Well, okay, I'll ______ your instrument and leave."" And that's all I can remember."
"D-076"	"#D-076 (2011-09-13 (26)) The first I can't really remember. It was one of those nights where I know I slept, but I slept really lightly and I kept waking up. So the first dream, I dreamt that I was putting on a puppet show and there were these really, really funny-looking cootie-bug like type puppets, and I was making them jump up and down and say stupid nonsense things and whatever else like that. And then I woke up and was awake for about half an hour. And then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was on a plane, one of those little planes like we flew on when we went to Key West -- I don't know exactly what you call it, but more private than commercial. And for some reason these dreams about flying, I have this sort of nondistinct sort of relationship between being in a plane and being in a car. And it was kind of the same thing, and the way it usually goes is I'm in a car and I'm riding with somebody, and then I realize that I'm flying; or maybe it's the other way around, or, you know. But this time I was with two or three other people and we were coming back from some kind of conference, and I was trying to get home. And apparently we had to land like at some strange airport that wasn't where I wanted to be. And it was like, we're in this big building, but we're going down water slides and stuff, and we're kind of splashing and playing in the water. And we're apparently trying to pass our layover because I had to wait like four and a half hours before I could get on another plane. Then I realized I was stark naked and there's all these people around [laugh] and I was thinking, ""What are going to say about me going on a plane stark naked?"" And then I woke up and it was some other hour, I think it was about 7:00. And then I went back to sleep, unintending, and I dreamt that I not only didn't finish my degree at the college, but I had just been let go, and that people were saying that when I was working there, I falsified documents and made things look so that they weren't right. And apparently according to them, I didn't do in on purpose; I did it because I just wasn't attentive to detail and couldn't really read everything I was supposed to. And I don't know exactly all the details, but it was something like that. And it was almost like being in high school, because the two campuses were sort of combined again. And again, I was stark naked and I was walking around, and apparently -- I don't know -- I think I had scheduled a cab or I didn't connect with a cab after I had been let go, and I was there wandering around aimlessly with nothing to do and I had like three hours before I could go home. And I was like laying down in a sunny patch by some bushes and I was like crawling along the ground and hoping nobody would see me. And then I woke up. [laugh] That was bizarre, and how bizarre and how bizarre!"
"D-077"	"#D-077 (2011-09-15 (26)) some orchestra conductor or somebody was going to put on this great big, huge, giant oratorio that was like really really long and had like 100 singers and 100 orchestra people and stuff. It was the classic late Romantic gargantuan m______ sing, although I had the feeling like the composer was a rogue like Handel or somebody. And the goal was for them to do this totally without any electrical power of any kind from the grid. So apparently I think they were going to put up, they weren't going to have any amplification for one thing. And I saw lots of lights on the music stands and there were like Christmas lights along the stage, and they said that they were run on solar energy. And I was supposed to participate in this thing, but I really didn't have a score, I didn't know what we were doing, I was just going to kind of bumble along. I was supposed to play piano, but quite frankly I thought I could just sort of hide in the back and pretend because there would be so much going on, nobody would hear me anyway. So basically the little bit of action in this dream, I was in some foggy stuff I don't remember. One thing I really do remember was I was behind this huge, huge, huge bleacher thing that was really risers that went like -- you know how most chorus risers have like three or four tiers! Well, this one had like 10 or 15 tiers to it. It was like really, really high and really, really steep. And I was thinking, ""Gee, the people up there can't be afraid of heights in order to do this thing."" And I was just thinking, ""Gee, I hope this thing doesn't fall on me back here,"" because I was like back behind it. And then I woke up."
"D-078"	"#D-078 (2011-09-24 (26)) Alright, this is a test. I'm going to try something new today. My little tape machine broke, so I'm going to have to try to record this digitally and see how it goes. Last night I was having a dream that we were all at the beach and I was riding on some kind of boogey board or something, some kind of something or other, and I was paddling around trying to kind of swim a little bit, and I was looking for a place where I could just sort of float and be away from people. And everywhere I kind of went there was another person or another thing, and I was paddling way out to the deep. And when I was out to the deep, there was this big -- it almost didn't look like a ship, it looked like a big truck floating out in the water. But I reasoned that it has to be either a boat or a ship or something. And it had its engine running, and it really sounded like a diesel truck engine like you hear on the highway. It was sitting still, but I thought, ""This thing could move any minute now,"" so I figured I'd better get out of its way. So I started paddling real quick back towards the shallow section and there were a lot of people around. And then I met with Mom and there were some other people there that I thought we knew, but I don't remember who they were now. And apparently we were supposed to meet up with Dad at some point, but he was doing something else. Oh, and there was another funny thing -- we were talking about whether Santa would come to town on an inner tube, and we were saying how hilarious and ridiculous that would be. [laugh] Oh, there's more to this, I can't remember for sure, but then I realized that all the other people in the water were from like a cruise, and that the cruise had arranged for a bus to take everybody back to a hotel. And we were staying at that hotel, so we figured, ""Well, gee, we'll just hitch a ride on the bus."" So I imagine we dried ourselves off and got on the bus with all our blankets and picnic baskets and stuff, and in this dream Mom and I each had a cell phone and Dad had his own cell phone. So I said, ""Okay, we need to call Dad's cell phone and tell him that we're on a bus and we're going to meet back at the hotel instead of at the beach. So Mom called Dad's cell phone and, of course, she didn't say, ""We're on a bus; we're going to meet you back at the hotel."" She said that, ""Oh gee, I got a funny missed call on my cell phone and the person who called me, I don't see the numbers. I see a bunch of strange letters. And I wonder if you know what this is about,"" and a whole roundabout thing, and, of course, she got irritated. And when she hung up, I said, ""Why didn't you just tell him we're on the bus and we're going to meet at the hotel""? And I got a little frustrated with her because she just misses the obvious so much sometimes. And then I said, ""Well, it's okay, I know you have this trouble sometimes,"" and all of that. And then I woke up. Oh great, now I dropped it [recorder] Now I've got to find it. Isn't this crazy!"
"D-079"	"#D-079 (2011-09-28 (26)) I am quite the sicky chicky right now, as you can probably tell. Peep, peep, peep, peep. I first of all wanted to see if the batteries in this thing are still good, which it appears that they are, and also I wanted to recount something funny that I remembered when I was digging through a box of stuff trying to get myself reorganized with the meager strength I have today. So I don't know if I already put this on one of my other tapes, but I figured it's better to have twice than not at all. I remember there was time when I was young -- I have no idea how old I was -- I could have been a toddler, I could have been five or six, possibly seven, something like that. And we were up in Jackson during the winter time. And it was Halloween. And, come to think of it, the time that I remember, the one time I remember really getting out of school to go to Jackson was when I was in kindergarten. So I was probably in kindergarten at the time because it was Halloween and there's not really a big school holiday for Halloween, but I know it was Halloween and we were in Jackson. Either that, or it was actually later; it could have been Thanksgiving and we were just playing Halloween. But [laugh] I felt like it was Halloween, whether it was Thanksgiving or Christmas or whatever. Okay, so it was winter time and it was really cold outside, and it wasn't really practical to go trick-or-treating around the neighborhood and slipping and sloshing through the snow and ice. So we came up with a novel solution to our problem. We were at Uncle Larry's house and Josie and Bobby and I all put costumes on. I don't remember what Bobby was, but I think Josie was a witch and she was fussing about how her hat didn't fit right or something. Josie was always fussing about something when they were little. And I remember I was a bear. Aunt Christine found this bear costume somewhere, and I remember her showing it to me, saying, ""You're going to look like a bear when I put this on you."" So there we were, and we were at Uncle Larry's house, and Uncle Larry went in his bathroom, Mom went in his studio and Aunt Christine went in the bedroom. And we three kids took turns going around knocking on each of those doors saying, ""Trick or treat."" And each time we would go like to one to the next to the next and back around again. So [laugh] I remember we must have gotten candy and stuff. They kept putting candy in our bags each time we came around, and Uncle Larry was the one who was the most creative and the most trying to be spooky and stuff, and he would say scary things like, ""What do you want?"" And I remember one time near the end he picked each of us up and kind of hung us upside down or something like that. And I think at one point we each got one of those pop-up things. Josie got -- I don't remember -- Bobby got the skull and I got the pumpkin, so Josie must've gotten the witch. You know those things with the suction cup where you put them down and then, when you least expect it, they pop up and then they fall down? So they saved those 'til the very end, and that's all of that story that I can think of right now."
"D-080"	"#D-080 (2011-10-01 (26)) I know I got some sleep last night because I had a dream. I dreamt that I was back at PLE and I was in a great big Anglican church. And I remember we were singing a hymn that I knew because I was singing in my sleep, I mean, probably not really, but at least in my dream I was. And the thing was I was being led by some boy, somebody that was actually part of me, one of the volunteers or somebody, and I think that he was in the service and there were a few more people that were in the service. And he led me up, we had to like at some point we had to process like from the organ loft down like to the main chancel. It was almost as if we were giving communion, although I don't remember that actually. And he led me up down like way too early, like way before everybody else, and the pastor kind of said, ""What are you doing up here so early?"" and kind of sent us back to our seats. And then after _____ and all, we had to go back up to the organ loft and we were singing, ""Christian men rejoice with heart and soul and voice."" He took me way early up there too, but that didn't really matter. And a lot of the people were in the service were wearing a uniform and the priest or pastor said, ""What are you doing in uniform today?"" I don't know what was up with that. And now I remembered what else I dreamt. I dreamt that for some reason I was in this great, great big, big building and it had something to do with something that was top secret, like it was like one of those big buildings in New York, but it was like a government building. And I have no idea why I was there except I know I took a cab there and I know I had some kind of business there. And this man was kind of helping me find my way around, and then all of a sudden things started beeping as though there was going to be some kind of alarm that sounded. And I got all nervous and jerky, and I told the man about it and he didn't really seem to get it. He was ______ with it. And apparently on the top floor there was this main like control room where this lady in charge of everything sat, and she had like a co-pilot, if you will. And I wanted to talk to her. The only way I was going to really relax about this is if I talked to her and let her know. And so as time went on, the man started to catch on to what I was so worried and scared about, and he started to help me rush faster and faster to get up to this office and this lady. And there so many other interesting little things along the way that I just don't remember. And then I got to the lady's office and I don't remember what happened up there, but I remember finally feeling safe, like I was in a place where if the alarm went off, I wouldn't really hear it that well. And I was also feeling safe in that we were kind of out of the way of all the chaos of what was going on because it was pretty crazy in there. That's all I remember."
"D-081"	"#D-081 (2011-10-02 (26)) I've still got a little bit of a frog in my throat, but I'm getting better, I think. Last night I had a not-so-good dream. I dreamt that it was Easter time, of all things, and I had gotten Mom and Dad a keyboard so that they could learn to play the piano if they wanted. And apparently I think they must have wanted to. It was kind of like the first one I had, like the cheap Radio Shack model. It wasn't really that big. So I had wrapped it up and put it on a stand so it was kind of pretty obvious what it was. And we were doing the usual Easter basket thing, and Mom had put some little things in my Easter basket. I had a feeling like they were like note pads and little diddley things like that. And we were going to do Easter things on Easter morning. And I don't remember what happened or why, but Mom and Dad had some kind of argument and Dad decided, ""Well, I don't want to do any Easter things now. In fact, I don't want to do any Easter things this week."" So I figured, ""Well, okay, that figures. I'm going to open my Easter basket all by myself, and I'm going to take everybody's presents back upstairs, and I might not even keep them; I'll just get rid of them."" And then I can't really remember opening my Easter basket, and then I'm trying to remember what else there was. I was in the kitchen and Mom and Dad were on the back steps. And Mom and Dad were trying to talk about making a schedule and holding _______ mark again, and Dad like, there was a bush of sort of like daisies, I think, and Dad whipped his hand across the bush and was on purpose like knocking all the blooms off of the bush and starting to yell. And I think I, I opened the door and said, ""Hey, everybody, you have to stop this. This isn't civil. What are you doing here? You're wrecking things."" And somehow Dad slid and fell backwards and pushed me backwards too, and I was laying on the floor and his torso was laying on top of me, and not really on purpose, we just sort of fell and that's how it happened. And I felt like I was being crushed, and I said, ""Get up, get up; I can hardly breathe. I can't move."" And he said, ""Well, you'll just have to get yourself up."" And so I twisted and fought and pushed and fought my way out from under him, and eventually I was able to get free and get up, and then I woke up."
"D-082"	"#D-082 (2011-10-11 (26)) I overslept again today. Last night I was having a dream. I don't remember if I was at St. Bartholomew's or St. Thomas, but I was at one of those churches. And it was kind of small and local and Episcopalian, I know that much, and I was in there to take some pictures and then possibly play the organ. And the doors were unlocked and I felt like I could just walk in because I know that neither one of them really, I don't think either of them has anything to be afraid of like Central Lutheran does. So I was in there and I was sort of having feelings like, ""Gee, what if somebody catches me in here; what would they think?"" And before I could take a picture -- I wanted to take one of those pictures where it's kind of a crazy illusion where you're standing there and you're looking up and you see all the stained glass windows and everything. But somebody came in and said, ""You know you really shouldn't be in here, so I had to leave, but then two other people were coming in behind her, and before I knew it, all of Dr. Keyes class was in there to rehearse. And I think even Astrid was there, because she's in college chorus now. And in that part of the dream there weren't any pews or anything. There was this great big wide open space where they were standing and rehearsing. And, in fact, when Dr. Toronto's chorus was assembling, the scene kind of shifted and they were in the cafeteria. And we were like in a school cafeteria, like either at Bancroft Middle School or at Oceanside Elementary. It wasn't like Westport High School's cafeteria. And I'm trying to think, I think some people were sitting and some people were standing, but they were basically in formation. And I walked in the door and I asked Dr. Toronto, ""Is it okay if I just listen today?"" And he said, ""Why sure."" So -- get this -- I put a pallet and a blanket down and some pillows and I laid down and I listened to them rehearse laying down, as if I were going to a sleepover. [laugh] What is up with that? And there were some times during the rehearsal when somebody was just goofing around or they're doing what they were supposed to or something, and he just sort of went over and talked to them quietly and then they left. And I heard people make comments about that. And so there was kind of an uproar, I mean a moderate uproar in rehearsal. I have no memory of what they were singing or how they were doing it. There was kind of a little episode there because Dr. T. said we were going to have to cut it short because they were going to do a fire drill and we were going to have to go outside. And as long as we were going to be interrupted, we may as well go outside because it was going to happen like any second now. So all these like 40 or 50 choristers were going out ahead of me, and I thought, ""Gee, how am I going to get out in time?"" And, as a matter of fact, I got outside before it happened and I never heard it in this dream. And I started walking away from the school, like so that I would be further away when it happens. And Dr. T. started walking with me, and we were walking down the little path that was kind of off school grounds, if you will. And, again, I'm not even sure what school I was at in this dream. So while we were walking, he was talking to me and encouraging me, ""You know, you should start singing again."" And I was thinking, ""Well, I don't know. I don't think I can."" And he had me match some notes and I could match them, and he said, ""See there?"" He was talking about hymns and how easy it is to learn to sing hymns. And then I woke up."
"D-083"	"#D-083 (2011-10-17 (26)) It was one of those deals where I woke up in the night and then slept really lightly. And I was hearing some music in the background. And the dream was that I was on this crazy thing that would, I guess I had the notion was made from the recycling cart, you know, the cart that I take to the store and to recycle bins. But it was a flat piece of wood with wheels and a lawn chair stuck to it. And I was riding on it, and I was rolling down the sidewalk, and actually, yeah, I could steer it by tilting my body a certain way. So I was rolling down the sidewalk with Big Bird on my lap, and I was rolling through the 22nd Avenue crosswalk, and apparently I had just enough time to reach out and push the button as I kept on rolling and rolling. And I said, ""Gee, I hope the cars stop."" And I was really scared about that. But I managed to roll through the street without any incident, and it was like I couldn't stop the thing, it just kept rolling. And it was rolling, rolling, rolling all like down the big bike trail that we take at the park sometimes, and I kind of leaned way far to the right to make it go like past the playground. And -- get this -- I was naked. I was in my underwear with no top, and I was at the park, and I had gotten to a nice sunny warm spot that I was going to sit down and just sort of take a nap, I think. And some guy came up to me and started talking to me. I don't even remember what he was saying. But he was saying, ""Shouldn't you, what if you get cold? Shouldn't you be wearing more clothes?"" or something like that, and I was so embarrassed."
"D-084"	"#D-084 (2011-10-31 (26)) I was riding on a big ship with some older ladies. I felt like they were people I knew, but I wasn't really sure who they were. And we were going someplace. I had a feeling that they didn't like to fly, so we were traveling by boat instead of by air. And I was inviting them to come and see me at home sometime. And they said, ""Oh no, I couldn't really do that because my car would need to be washed,"" or something goofy like that. And then the next scene was that I was in the back yard and we had a pet goat. And we had six or seven baby chicks. It was a pretty nice dream. I dreamt that I had four yellow chicks. There were two that were kind of golden, like they'd grow up to be Golden Comets. And there was one with dark feathers, and I wasn't sure if it was a Rhode Island Red or a black chicken. But I was worried that the goat would eat them, and I was doing all kinds of things to try and keep them apart. I was out behind the garage in the alley and trying to feed the goat grass, and then the goat laid down and I laid down and I was kind of picking up handfuls of grass and dropping it over where the goat's head was. And I realized the goat was asleep. And then next thing I knew, the goat was laying down inside the fence by the back gate, and the chickies were walking and climbing over him, and I was trying to move them and get them away from him real fast. But then I noticed he was just laying there as they were climbing over him, and I realized that goats don't eat meat, that goats are herbivores, I think. And then I woke up."
"D-085"	"#D-085 (2011-11-01 (26)) somehow Mom had won us tickets to go to the new Celine Dion Las Vegas show, but even though that I felt that it was that show, it had come to a venue that was either Eastport or Bayfront or somewhere close by our neighborhood. And the first scene we were there pretty early so that you could park and get a good spot. And people were running around doing a sound check, and I was having excited because we were going to get to hear the sound check. But it wasn't anything interesting like the sound checks that we hear that she does. It was just the technical crew like checking mikes and lame stuff like that. So somebody said they had three pencils, of all things, and somebody wanted somebody to volunteer to go deliver them to Celine's dressing room, and I thought that would be pretty cool. And I had a feeling like it was a place where she lived, like almost like she lived at the venue, kind of like at Cesar's, how she lived for a while. But as Mom and I and, of course, I volunteered, so as Mom and I were walking down the hall to go down the elevator, I realized that, first of all, they didn't tell us where to go, and second of all they didn't give us anything in writing or any kind of a pass so the people wouldn't believe us when we told them what we were supposed to do. So we decided we had to go back to the lady who gave them to us and get something more from her, or have her call somebody or something like that. But next thing I knew, we were out at the car. I guess we had moved it or something and Mom had parked it at kind of a crazy angle in a driveway. And we were sitting on the curb next to it because they wouldn't let us back in the parking lot because they were either resurfacing it or an accident happened or something. So there were all kinds of emergency vehicles going by, and some of them just had their lights and some of them whooped their sirens kind of intermittently like they do in a parade. And I was pretty nervous and jerky. I was sitting in Mom's lap, kind of covering my ears, trying to back as far from the road as I could and all that excitement kind of wore me out. I remember feeling really worn out after that. And then next thing I knew, we were back in the show. The place was different than what it was when we started out when we were there for sound check, it was like a real stadium kind of auditorium, and now it was like a school cafeteria. And I had the feeling that there were going to be all these other singers there, kind of like one of those TV specials where they have a lot of singers. And we were going to, I think Celine was going to sing like one song and then like be a part of two or three others. And I remember enjoying the other singers, but I remember being a little disappointed. And we were like way at the side so I couldn't see anything, and there were these cafeteria tables rather than regular auditorium seats. And people that I knew -- like Dr. Toronto and Mr. Setzer were in the front taking pictures and diddling around and stuff. And then I think after that I woke up before too much of the show was underway."
"D-086"	"#D-086 (2011-11-02 (26)) I was at some, I was performing in some organ concert, and it was kind of a big deal. I felt like it was the Halloween dinner at Christ Methodist, because they had their little step going up to the organ. And I was playing one of my great big giant pieces. I don't know if it was either my Hindemith pieces, or maybe it was the Bach Prelude in C Minor. It could have even been the Buxtehude Passacaglia that I'm working on right now. But I was playing a piece that had multiple sections. And I got up there and I just had no clue what I was doing, and I got to the middle section and I got to where I wasn't playing the notes any more; I was just making stuff up and it was hard to just play and make it sound consonant and plausible. And then I just sort of ended it on a, just resolved it to a major chord and thought, ""I need to just stop all of this."" And normally, if I were playing something like that in church, nobody would be the wiser and I would kind of be off the hook. But here we were at the AGO concert, so Mr. Dawson and everybody and their brother was there and I was extremely embarrassed because I just totally didn't practice or anything. I just totally went up there and made a complete fool of myself. And I'm trying to remember how the conversation went with him. I can't really remember the words, but the idea was, I think he was just a little bit taken aback at how unprepared I was and trying hard to be nice about it. And that's all there was to it."
"D-087"	"#D-087 (2011-11-17 (26)) I don't remember all the parts really, but I dreamt that Aunt Janice still lived near my hometown and I dreamt that Mom was driving me up to see her, and she lived in the middle of North ______, something like that. And the main thing was, she wanted to see how I'm doing with my ____ Disease. And while I was up there with her, the rest of the family was getting together back at home or something. And the weird part was while I was up there, Aunt Janice was going to this Jehovah's Witnesses convention. Now I forget what the name of her tradition is, but her tradition doesn't like medical treatment for its individuals. They sort of shun that, which is kind of scary, but anyway, I know she's not a Jehovah's Witness. So the weird part of this whole thing was that there was this playground and I had the feeling like grown individuals, like middle-aged adults, were going to play on the playground and sing the ""Wee Sing"" song as part of the Jehovah's Witness convention. Now what's up with that, I don't know. And there was this boy -- probably about 10 or 11 -- kind of right near one of my students, and he was going to have me go down a tunnel slide, but I was looking at it and I realized how little it was compared to my size these days. And I thought, ""Gee, this is going to be claustrophobic; I'd better not do this."" And then he showed me that there was a bigger, open one, and he wanted me to go down after him. And I can't actually remember climbing up the slide, but I remember standing at the bottom and sort of kissing him as he came down. And then we were all kind of in a line, we were dancing around, singing, ""Go 'round and 'round the village,"" the song from the ""Wee Sing"" ______ song. And there were others that we were going to do, and I wanted to record this thing that we were doing. It's funny, when I dream about the ""Wee Sing"" tape now, there's like no fear or anything. It's just nice and fun and pleasant, and I don't associate it with anything scary any more. And then it was the next day and I had to, I was going with her on Sunday morning to like a Kingdom Hall, and I realized as we were sitting down and getting ready to start that -- ""Oh, my gosh, I'm supposed to be home on Sunday so that I don't miss Laurie and so I can do the anthem with them and so I can play the prelude."" And then I was trying to call somebody, but I didn't know the number for Central Lutheran and I didn't have Laurie's number, but I knew Aunt _____'s number, of all things, so I thought if I called her, I could tell her, and she would somehow tell the others that I wasn't going to be there and that I'm sorry not to leave them hanging any more. And then I remember __________ these b_____ - I can't remember what they were called -- and then there was this really upbeat praise music that I kind of liked, but I wasn't crazy about having to be there. It was just like what they were doing and I had to kind of go along with it. And that was all I can remember."
"D-088"	"#D-088 (2011-11-20 (26)) I was being given a chance to play at Pizza Factory or someplace like that, and I was sitting at home trying to work up some theater organ arrangements that I hadn't touched in a god's age. And I was trying to be wildly optimistic about that would go and what was going to come of it, that I could whip up five or six arrangements in like a week. And at home my organ console was a horseshoe like a real theater organ, but it sounded the same, and I was thinking how I hadn't even had the tremulants on in months or years. And for some reason at home the floor was crooked. It slanted down. You started at the north end of the living room and the coffee table was up high, and then as you went further to the south, the floor just slanted and slanted and slanted. So I remember sitting at the organ and feeling like I was tilted for some reason and that was why. And I remember thinking, ""Gee, this is strange. I wonder if our house is going to collapse or cave in."" And I was working on an arrangement from ""The Little Mermaid"" and I had this drawing that it was like already printed and I had colored it. It was like two crabs, it was like Sebastian and these other two orange crabs and Ariel, and there were like hearts and flowers in the background and it was all in a heart-shaped cut-out of a paper. And I had it up on the organ to kind of inspire me, I guess. And I was remembering a story that wasn't really in the movie, but apparently from some sequel that I had made up in my imagination, like I always do in dreams. And apparently this sequel was where Ariel was a human and then she came back down to the sea and she was Sebastian and they had a whole big reunion and everything. And I can't remember what more there was to it. I just remember sitting there trying to work feverishly on these arrangements and trying to get them all in in a certain amount of time and the floor being crooked and things kind of going whacko and people were coming in and kind of disturbing me, and I was wishing they'd all just get lost and let me practice and work without any interruptions. And then I woke up."
"D-089"	"#D-089 (2011-11-27 (26)) First of all I dreamt that I had met some man who had given me sort of an adaptor like type thing. It was a little machine and then a thing that you would attach to a tape. And he said that it was an adaptor that would turn a regular tape into a tape with synchs on it. So what you had to do was you had to put a regular tape in my desk tape player with the sound system, and then you had to run the signal output to it with RCA's that converge into like a ______ adaptor, and you had to plug it into this little adaptor machine thing. And then you had to connect that, you had to put a blank tape into Big Bird and he would record it as a tape with synch on it. And that was kind of silly. And I dreamt that this guy also gave me like a behind-the-scenes making of ""A Very Special Picnic"" that you can hear how it was made, and they would take about like some of the writers and how they actually did it. Then the next scene, I was making spaghetti or something in the kitchen and I think I was warming up pizza and I was making spaghetti. And I was trying to put the cover on the spaghetti dish. Actually it was one of those plastic Tupper Ware things, and Mom was like trying to do it with me, and she didn't think I could do it myself. And I yelled at her and I said, ""Let me do this myself. This is such a simple thing."" And she said, ""But you're going to spill it on you; you're going to spill it all over."" And I said, ""No, I can do this. You need to back off and let me do this."" And so I did that, and then I was deciding whether we had enough slices of pizza for everybody. And then I woke up."

I didn't have any conference or group thing to go to. I just was going to go to this strange city in Europe, and I was just going to show up and I was going to wander around until I found something -- I don't know -- I was just going to wander around and try to be a tourist in a big, strange city. And then I was thinking about how long the flight would be and I was thinking about how scary it would be to just show up and not really have anybody there with me. And I think there was some more. I think I decided that I was just going to stay in this country and go to one of the conferences or something like that. And then last night I had a dream that I was at the Westport High School library, but I thought it was at the college. And Mrs. Talmadge was there and she looked a lot like Kathy Bates in ""Harry's Law"" and it was like that in that the library had a whole bunch of shoes and things at the very front, and then you had to go in the back to look for books. And I was walking around and looking at the shoes, trying to find some books. And then there was this dog that was wandering around in there and I was back in the back for some reason. I think there was a CC TV back there that I was going to use. And the dog was wandering around, and the people were asking me to try to keep him corralled back in the back and not go out to the front where all the people were. And I was looking for a back door so that I could let him out if he had to go outside. And then that was all."
"D-091"	"#D-091 (2011-12-04 (26)) I had, actually Mom and I were going to go somewhere. I don't remember where or what we were doing. But, you know how before I get in the car sometimes when I'm going with Mom, I'll raise the antenna a little bit? Well, the car in this dream was like a baby toy. It was like one of those things that kids sit in and push through the floor with their feet, plastic things that roll along the sidewalk, except it looked red and white like the color design of our car and it didn't have a top, just like a kiddy car. And it had an antenna on it, but it was like a white wire like house receivers have, and it was sort of dragging along the floor as I pushed this along on the living room floor. And I don't remember if it had anything in it or not, but I don't think so. And it was the weirdest thing, and I was like pushing it out the front door and bumping it down the steps and everything. And then that was all I could remember of that little scene."
"D-092"	"#D-092 (2011-12-04 (26)) I was going to fly to Jackson in the winter time because I think Mom was already up there because Uncle Larry was either having health problems or had passed away. And I was in the airport and I was just thinking, ""I have to get up there,"" and I was calling them to let them know I was coming. And they were already starting the boarding call for the plane and I think I was sitting at the gate. And I hung up, they were keeping me on the phone even though I was trying to get them to let me go, I mean keeping me on the phone. And I was crying because they said Uncle Larry was having trouble, and so I was running through this door and onto this thing that I thought was the plane. And then I realized it had posts in the middle like a trolley car or like a subway, and it was a tram train, and it was a tram train taking me back to like another city or something. And I was really upset because I was like, ""There's no way I'm going to catch this plane in time."" And then I woke up."
"D-093"	"#D-093 (2011-12-08 (26)) I was at a place that was a little bit like the Jungle Park Gift Shop that was there before they renovated and made it all different. And it was kind of like that, and it was kind of like Bizarro's and it was kind of like the Mosey thing that we went to when I was little, and it was kind of like the Pier Aquarium. And there was a, I was with Vince and Lizzy Gardner, who apparently -- I'm not even really sure who they are, but they're related to Dad's side of the family somehow. And I barely know them, but I had the feeling that I was with them and we were walking around looking at things. We started like in a very back part where it was pretty well lit and there was a bakery, and we were looking around at pies and things. And there was this pudding that they called Ginger Bluing because it was blue pudding. And I think we were walking down an aisle and there was like a b_______ elephant ride kind of like the horse that used to be at Jungle Park. And then I was looking at a fish tank and it was this -- they set up this long rubbery thing that you would sit on and slide down to look at all the different fish in the fish tanks that were going by. And I was laying on my stomach and looking down at a fish tank and was putting my hand in the fish tank trying to catch a goldfish or touch one or something. And I would look up and I would see all kinds of lights along the ceiling kind of like the Coliseum. And then we were walking again with Vince and Lizzy and I didn't have my cell phone. I think Mom and Dad had my purse and they had kind of separated from us. And somebody had called for me on my phone, and it was like a college recruiter. I had the feeling that it was somebody from Modern Media College, but they didn't actually say it. They said it was some other name. And Dad was like, ""What are doing calling? You give all of our young people all kinds of delusions. There aren't any jobs to be had out there anyway."" And then he passed it over to me, and I said, ""Well, I'm with family I haven't seen in a really long time, so I'm not going to talk now,"" and I just hung up. And that was all I could really remember. I think I got it a little out of sequence. I think the fish tank thing was last, but anyway, that was pretty strange."
"D-094"	"#D-094 (2011-12-09 (26)) I was on a cruise. Well, actually when it started, Samantha and Derek were here and it was a Sunday, I can remember, and I can remember thinking that it was the only day that I was going to be totally free and not have a lot of stuff to do. And we were, this thing was going to be gone all day and it was going to eat up my one day that I didn't have a whole lot to do. And I was thinking how I needed to get stuff done, and I was at the monitor doing my paperwork and stuff. And the car with Samantha and Derek and Mom and Dad pulled away and I thought to myself, ""Okay, they're gone,"" but I was still kind of waffling in my mind as to whether I wanted to go or not, and the man from the cruise line company kind of talked me into going, I guess. And so I don't know how I got there, but next thing I knew, I had caught up with them and was at the dock and we were walking down the gang plank for this great big boat, which was all wood. It was like a wooden boardwalk that you walk on, like when you're at a nature park. It had all the railings and everything. And actually when I was on the boat, next thing I was looking out and I was seeing like all these mountains and things and seagulls flying around in the mountains. And I turned to somebody next to me and I was like, ""Where are we?"" And they said, ""We're in Australia."" And I was flabbergasted. And they said that we were going to go to Africa and see animals there. And I'm trying to think -- I don't really remember interacting that much with Samantha and Derek or Mom and Dad. I just remember there were these things where, you know, there were these certain moments when they advised everybody to go and strap down because the boat was going to be rocking, kind of like they do on an airplane when they're going to be taking off and landing. But there were times you could kind of walk around or lay down on one of those benches or something like that. And that's all I can remember."
"D-095"	"#D-095 (2011-12-19 (26)) We were having a party at the house in the front yard, and I was setting up the Peavey system and the keyboard. And I had brought the Peavey system around front and we had our yard decorated with the Christmas lights and everything, and Mom and Dad were kind of giving me trouble as to where I was going to put it. And I had it out there and I was trying to deal with a bunch of other things at the same time. And I was going to bring the keyboard out and I was going to play. And then there was something to do with the fact that I had the Peavey system out there and it started to rain, which that's not really surprising that this showed up because that's what happened at the Barrett's place. Thank goodness we had a tarp in the truck. And then I dreamt that I was at the fruit stand, of all places, and we were having like a class for kids and there were people on the floor that were coloring, and there were people that were dancing and playing instruments and things. And I had brought Big Bird and set him on top of one of the shelves up high where the fruits were. And I was thinking that I would show him to the kids if anybody seemed interested, but at the time they were all doing their own thing. And then some of the -- I don't know -- some of the kids said they had a monkey. Some of the kids said they had a dancing monkey or something, and that Tiro Price (?) was a company that made stuff like that still. And that was all I can remember and then I woke up."
"D-096"	"#D-096 (2011-12-28 (26)) It was still the week before Christmas and that I was supposed to go to the Botanical Gardens to play one more time and it was a Friday. And I had to haul my own keyboard and my own Peavey system and everything. And Mom and Dad were going, and for some reason Carol and Frederick from church were going to help us out and we had some kind of a Santa sleigh that we were going to put out there too. And I can remember just sort of being curled up on the couch and saying, ""I don't really feel like going,"" because in my dream I felt like I wasn't feeling so well and that I just wanted to lay around and not even move. But for some reason I remember packing stuff up in that dream. For some reason I remember the keyboard being in the front yard, like set up, and the truck was parked in the driveway and I was running to put stuff in it, like Dad and I each picked up an end of the keyboard and just sort of slid it into the truck. And then I ran around to trace the cord to the bushes so that I could unplug the W________ and throw it in my bag too and pick up everything up and just there were other things I was packing, like Christmas decorations. And then I remember it was still a week before Christmas and we were going to play something with hand bills in church, and for some reason they wanted me to learn that too. And I remember we were like at a great big place and maybe we were, I had the feeling Frederick was there and I think we were at the Coolidge Hall an he was going to bring like one or two of the other bells, give them to me to take home so I could practice my part. And I remember just thinking, ""Gee whiz, how on earth am I ever going to learn another piece before Christmas?"" because I had all the anthems and the quartet and my organ part that I just knew sort of by the skin of my teeth. And that was all that I can remember about that."
