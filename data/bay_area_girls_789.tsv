I run back and forth to the satin then the trash, back and forth and back and forth. But in the middle of the piece of satin is a woman.

I caught it and licked it - raspberry - and I was at a concert with this really cool (and cute) guy. I licked it again - strawberry - and I was in the meadow!

They lay on the floor, blood streaming out of them. I stood there and I didn't know what to do, so I started screaming and they tried to shoot me but bullets bounced off, and they were unarmed.

Characters: Robin L. is one of my friends in school, and there were also two guys from school so I knew them all. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I thought that this dream was very strange. I mean, why would a guy kidnap me from school?"
"401-13"	"#401-13 (7th grader, 02/02/97) I was at home when I answered the door. A person was there who said, ""Congratulations, you have won anything and everything you want forever.""

I was hurt and mad at the tree so I started yelling at it, but the boy still fell off - except now he fell into this huge pit, so I went to the pit to look for him and I fell in too. There was this huge doll that kept quoting Shakespeare and I couldn't find the boy. Setting: In this big grassy place. Characters: The boy and the huge doll. The boy kinda looked like Tom Sawyer, but it wasn't him. The doll was one of those porcelain dolls they advertise in TV guides, except it had a pink frilly dress on and it was a guy.

"404-02"	"#404-02 (7th grader, 01/18/97) First I was talking to my grandma, then we were trying to find a seat in this huge lecture hall. Then I sat down in the first row next to my cousin. Then this lady came with a tray and gave me a cup of orange juice and a cup of soda. I was holding both and I couldn't balance myself at all. I finally got the cups under my seat.

He could drive (he backed out of the driveway at 50 mph), but we both rode mountain bikes to some dimly lit store where he wanted to buy a wooden model airplane. It was a long dream, but in most of it I seemed to be changing clothes. I would just get out of bed and change from sleepwear to normal clothes, or vice versa. I had a broken leg. Setting: At some old house that I've never seen, but that I thought of as Patrick's, and at a dim store. Characters: Patrick, my 15-year old cousin, lives in a small town in Missouri. He wrestles, plays in the marching band, and has a broken leg. His leg was broken in a wrestling match when the other guy didn't stop when the referee blew the whistle. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, neutral. I don't know why so much was unreal. I think ""middle of nowhere"" came from something I was reading. I was embarrassed about changing in front of my friend yesterday. I rode bikes with a friend yesterday. Also, yesterday I thought about driving for a while. It was a very long dream."
"416-03"	"#416-03 (7th grader, 01/20/97) It's hard to recall now. I was with a friend, and we were walking around an unknown city. People kept asking me ""what I was wearing,"" and Charla walked up to me and asked where I had gotten my CDs. One was Fugees. My friend and I kept passing this movie theater, and I knew it was a dream because I couldn't read anything. A bunch of people walked out because the animated characters moved throughout the building. I saw this incredibly good-looking guy with a silver, a gold and a blue lip stud. He went inside, but my friend said he'd meet me behind the gold curtain. When I went there, there were naked people changing. The guy at the counter said I had a phone call, but we got disconnected. Setting: A strange city, and mostly in and around a movie theater. Characters: I think the friend was Leah, one of my classmates. Carla is my music/drama/dance teacher. I don't know the cute guy, but he was older, 15 or 16. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, popular and confident. The curtains were the same colors as the studs. Last night, I was online and someone sent me a message saying they lived in Foster City and were interested in me, but we got disconnected. My friend and I talked about lip pierces yesterday. Also, both in the dream and yesterday, my friend was pressuring me to tell this guy I really like him."
"416-04"	"#416-04 (7th grader, 01/23/97) I can't remember it very well. A woman came to the school and talked to us about the effects of poverty on daily life.

Characters: My classmates (the 7th graders) were all in my dream, and a woman I don't know. She was about 40-something and had brown hair. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, worried.

We had a big fight about what color to make it and two of my friends left us. We later found them dead because they had starved in the snow. Setting: At a cabin in the woods. Characters: Five of my friends, two boys and three girls, and me. One of them I haven't seen in two years. Not all of them were even my very good friends. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried.

"418-03"	"#418-03 (7th grader, 01/18/96) I was at summer camp and there were all these duffle bags supposedly full of artifacts from hundreds of years ago, and we had to break into the bags. There was tons of cash inside. Then people started getting this disease where they would fall asleep with their eyes open, then they died. One group of kids was trying to figure out how to make Coca-Cola out of water and dirt, and my group was trying to figure out how to cure the disease. I don't remember whether we succeeded. Setting: It was summer camp but it was set at my school. Characters: Patty is my friend from school. She died. The counselors were all counselors from my summer camp. The rest of the kids I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It wasn't a particularly enjoyable dream, but what's weird is it wasn't like a scary dream because of the disease. It was still kind of playful."
"418-04"	"#418-04 (7th grader, 01/20/97) For some reason this girl and her family was living in our house with us. I hated her and we fought all the time.

Characters: This girl and I just never got along. I don't know why. She was in my house, but I hated her. She was the only character. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, hate. I'm trying to grow out my hair so I know why I felt so mad and helpless. I would kill her if it really happened."
"424-01"	"#424-01 (7th grader, 11/18/96) I'm in a sort of candy-land and everything is mainly red and white like those peppermint things. There's a big mushroom-shaped thing that looks like a peppermint candy, and it's boinging like a trampoline. Whenever I jumped on it I would be suspended in place and a soda would appear in one hand and some candy in another. Then I'd drop back down to the ground and play in candy land! Setting: Candy Land! Characters: I was all alone. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I loved it! After I woke up I really wanted to get back into it but I couldn't."
"424-02"	"#424-02 (7th grader, 01/21/97) All I remember was coming out of some building with Haley and seeing this hella cool car (some little cute red sports car) and then my mom gets out. My friend and I were like, ""Oh, my god!"" and I asked my mom ""Where'd you get that car?"" and she goes, ""On 19th and Sutter. I couldn't find our car so I took this one."" So my friend and I said ""cool"" and jumped into the car. Then I woke up. Setting: Somewhere like San Francisco. It was outside with a lot of cars on the sidewalk.

"424-04"	"#424-04 (7th grader, 01/25/97) I was at my friend Arlie's house and her mom suggested that we take their dog for a walk. I know that Joey lived down the street and we might see him. So I convinced her to go with me. We were heading out the door with her dog, when all of a sudden these grownups (maybe friends of her parents) showed up and Arlie's parents and them decided to come with us. We were trying to get away from them so we wouldn't be seen together. Finally, all the adults except one who had a little two year old girl. When we got to Joey's house, we noticed that we were wearing our ugly My school sweats and T shirts (which are from our school that we have to wear every morning and on trips sometimes - when Arlie and I went on a school ""midyear retreat"" and we had to wear our school clothes it was really embarrassing). This is especially embarrassing but we realized it didn't matter because Joey wasn't there. Also, I forgot earlier, there were two fine guys walking around who we saw and briefly talked to. I don't remember what we said. Setting: On Arlie's street and in her house, then at Joey's. Characters: Joey - I have the biggest crush on him that I've had for about six months, but I only see him every Tuesday for about two hours. He's in my religion class. Arlie's just my good friend. (Yesterday when Arlie and I went shopping at the mall, her two parents came with us which was really embarrassing.) Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, embarrassed. The embarrassing parts about clothes and adults was sort of reliving yesterday, and I always beg Arlie to walk down to Joey's house with me because I love him so much."
"426-01"	"#426-01 (7th grader, 01/18/97) We're in like a little card room eating a deep dish pizza (my favorite). The room is totally green except for one brown table. All of a sudden I was in New York walking down 5th Ave. with my mom. She put me on a bench and told me something like, ""Stay here and watch out."" She told me she was going to go get a pizza from my favorite pizza place in New York. So I waited. Wow, now that I think back, I was standing up the whole time because there was no benches available. Anyway, so I finally see a bench and there is a man sitting there. I sit down and he gets so hyper and is jumping everywhere, he says my name and then I somehow knew it was an uncle I don't usually see who we talked a lot about at dinner last night. So we were so happy. Then my mom arrived and said, ""Uncle B.!"" then I don't remember anything else. Setting: In a green room, and in New York, my favorite place. I always want to go. It was on 5th Ave. near a bench. Characters: My mom, my sister, and my uncle who I never see (and over dinner last night we talked a lot about him). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, bored. I was pretty relaxed, but happy that I was going to get my favorite pizza from my favorite place in New York, but I was bored while I was waiting, too. The weird thing is my uncle. We talked about him last night but I never see him. When I woke up the first thing I thought was ""am I late for school?"" Then I realized it was a Saturday! The dream seemed so long and had so much action in it."
"426-02"	"#426-02 (7th grader, 01/19/97) I was at the movies with Bill (a classmate) and then we got in some kind of a quarrel and he left. Then P.

"426-03"	"#426-03 (7th grader, 01/20/97) I was at some kind of flea market that had a bunch of really cool jewelry shops, and it had a calendar shop. So then my mom introduces me to this lady, a very strange looking lady. After the lady goes to one of the shops, my mom whispers to my grandma that she is a rapist. I heard that and was scared. So I look around at one jewelry shop when I have to go to the bathroom. The strange lady came by and I told her I had to go. She said, ""I'll take you,"" and grinned at me. I screamed for my grandma and when she came I said to both of them, ""Will you both take me?"" because I didn't want to be alone with the lady. My grandma told me she would be delighted to take me to the bathroom. The bathroom is all set up like a stable and I go in one of the stalls. Then my grandma said she had to leave and I was going to have to walk alone with this lady. When I get into the stall, it's not a stall. There's a rodeo going on. My friend Diana was there and I asked her if she could walk me back, but she couldn't.

"426-04"	"#426-04 (7th grader, 01/21/97) I was in Nintendo 64's Mario Brothers gameland, and this big baracuda was chasing me around a sunken ship. I was swimming as fast as I could. It was really strange and fast. Setting: Nintendo 64, one of the levels I played that night. Characters: It was me and this big like 30--foot long red and black baracuda. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was really scared and frantic and nervous that I was going to get eaten. The weird thing is that night I had played the level I had my dream in."
"426-05"	"#426-05 (7th grader, 01/23/97) I was watching 90210, and one girl was mad at the other and she was sending vicious notes to the other. Then all of a sudden I was in this room and there was this huge open door leading into an eating room, like a summer camp type eating room. In the room I was in there were letters on the wall like the ones on 90210, which was strange. Anyway, I got into the eating room and I see P. At the same time we both made that signal with our index fingers to come to each other and mouthed the words, ""yeah, we're not shy."" Then we walked towards each other. My mom then woke me up. Setting: Two rooms, one like a camp eating room, the other a plain old carpeted room. Characters: Shannen Doherty, Tori Spelling from 90210 (big brats), and P., who I luv, but we're usually both shy around each other. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed.

Anyway, I was in 8th grade and I was beautiful and popular and P. asked me out to the prom, so of course I said YES!! Then the next day a really cute guy comes to school named JC, and then he asks me to the prom so I said YES!!

"426-07"	"#426-07 (7th grader, 01/26/97) I was skiing alone at Badger Pass in Yosemite and everyone just disappeared, no one was there. I was alone and I felt lost, I got scared cause it started snowing, then a blizzard came and I started making a dome out of snow to keep me warm, but it didn't work. A big wind came and I felt my toes freezing (and then I woke up with a big jerk and I was sweating). Setting: In the cold snow, Badger Pass ski slopes in Yosemite. Characters: Only me, alone.

"426-09"	"#426-09 (7th grader, 01/29/97) I walked into school and everyone was in a circle (all the kids) and no one would let me in. They just ignored me. Even my best friend ignored me.

Setting: At school, being specific, the bathroom and studio 1. Characters: All my classmates, my best friend. They all had snotty mean looks on their faces.

A car went by and my friend said that was her mom, so we better get inside and get ready to go. She started really shivering so I said fine. We tried to grab all the paper. She ran inside with a bunch of scraps of paper, well I tried to get the rest. Then my mom and dad pulled in so I ran inside and my sisters were on the couch and we started talking. Then I noticed there was muddy paw prints from my dog going up the stairs. So I thought I have to go clean it. Setting: At my house, and outside in my driveway at 9:00 in the rain. Characters: Some guy who was helping me with outfits, white, nice, I think he was my cousin. Then my best friend and me and my two sisters. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, I guess. Regular. It was very bizarre. I mean out in the rain with scraps of paper? It was so strange and it seemed so regular in the dream. It was just an out-there kind of dream."
"426-11"	"#426-11 (7th grader, 02/01/97) I was at a mall and there was a group of kids. One girl and a bunch of guys surrounding her. I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember. Setting: First at an outdoor mall like in Nebraska or something. Then a hotel or something with a patio and a creek. Characters: This popular pretty white girl, four guys, and me - a girly klutz. Also my swim coach, a 70 year old guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy yet stupid, pitiful, dorkish. I was such a klutz and a baby. My coach whistling on like my back porch in the middle of nowhere. It was another bizarre dream."
"429-01"	"#429-01 (7th grader, 11/18/96) I was sitting on my bed and I looked up and saw a centaur. It fit the description of ""Chem"" in the Nords of Zanth by Peirs Anthony. On her back rode a women (sic) with green hair. They told me to get on the centaur's back and go with them. I did and we left. We ended up at a house in S.F. They told me to go knock on the door. I did and the person who opened it was my current crush. Setting: My house, and S.F. Characters: My crush, and 7th grade boy. A female centaur, very developed.

"429-02"	"#429-02 (7th grader, 01/24/97) I was at My school and my friends told me that the guy I have a crush on was there. So I went outside to see him. He was there with some of his friends. They were in his car. They all got out when they saw me. He was leaning on the front driver's side door. He looked at me and said, ""Look at my new car."" It looked like a 'vette, but it wasn't. He had left his window open and a weird guy (a person I don't know) jumped through the window and tried to steal the car. But I jumped through the car window and landed in the front passenger's side. I tried to stop him but he kept going. Then I managed to take the keys. I turned around the car and and to the weird guy's home. Then I drove to my crushes house and parked the car. His front door was open so I went in. His house was lit with candles. I saw him sitting in a chair sleeping. Then I woke up. Setting: my hometown. (School, car, boy's house.) Characters: Andrei - a guy I have liked for 5 years. He is almost 17. Friends - my ""big sib"" Liz. Leah - best friend. Robin F. - best friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, hopeful.

I told Liz to tell me if ever she saw him here, so Liz told me in my dream and I went out to talk to him."
"429-03"	"#429-03 (7th grader, 01/25/97) I was talking to this girl I have never met before, and Leah comes up and yells the fire drill at us, and we all run up to the upper parking lot at My school.

Characters: Leah is my good friend but we have been having some fights lately. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared. It sort of tells what's been happening in my life. I'm getting farther away from my friends."
"429-04"	"#429-04 (7th grader, 01/32/97) (sic). In my dream, I woke up and took a shower, made my lunch and ate breakfast. Then my brother told me that I was going with mom and that I could sleep in late. I woke up. Setting: My house. Characters: My older brother. Feelings and Thoughts: Tired. It made me get up late because it was so real I thought I was going with my mother."
"429-05"	"#429-05 (7th grader, 02/01/97) I turned into a mouse and was being chased by a cat. The cat was a big cat, it slowed down and swallowed me. I went down it's throat like I go down slides. I ended up in a green house with lots of honeysuckles. Setting: Outside, in a cat's throat, and in a greenhouse. Characters: Cat. Never seen it in life. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was very scared."

I met John Lennon and Elvis, and they played me a song. Setting: Heaven. Characters: John Lennon, Elvis, my dogs. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I think it's cool."
"429-07"	"#429-07 (7th grader, 02/03/97) I was at Great America and I was on the Drop Zone and the breaks failed. We all went into the ground. I separated from my body and watched myself get taken to the hospital. I woke up with a headache and was wondering where my room went. My cat baked cookies for me. They had pot in them so I got high. The nurse found me stoned, wandering around the kitchen eating kumquats. Setting: Great America, a hospital, and my kitchen. Characters: Nurse: she is my brother's first girlfriend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. I was kind of in control so I really liked it."
"429-08"	"#429-08 (7th grader, 02/04/97) I was a big fish and I was swimming through the air and I fell through a hole in a tree. I fell down to an underground river where a man with a big nose was saying, ""Moo, Oh how I love you."" And he was saying this to a cat sitting on a pedestal. Then I woke up. Setting: I have no idea. I was in a place I'd never seen before. Characters: Cat: big white angora with purple stripes. Man: never seen him in my life. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It was one of my many weird dreams but it doesn't surprise me."
"430-01"	"#430-01 (7th grader, 11/18/96) I was with my advisor (who is male) and we had just gotten back from a play/movie (I don't remember) and were in the Mark Antony Hotel (we stayed there in early October when the 7th and 8th grade went to Ashland, Oregon), and we had been discussing the way I present myself sexually, and how that makes others feel. Then we both got into bed (the same bed), and cuddled, like he might do with someone his age, and I am unclear if anything sexual happened after that, but if it did I remember he didn't think it was a big deal, and I was worried about what other people would think. But he made me feel relaxed. My brother was in the dream at the end. Setting: Mostly in the Mark Antony Hotel, in a room I recognized as one I had stayed in before. Characters: My advisor (I will leave out his name), who acted laid-back, and relaxed like he always is in real life. I think my brother appeared in the very end. He is 10, short, and looked like himself. I was also in it and for the most part I saw the dream through my eyes, though part of it I could see from 3rd person (perspective). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Unsure about what I was doing, worried that other people would think I'm weird for sleeping with my advisor, relaxed because he though it was okay, uncomfortable because I'd never done it before, friendship and respect because my advisor is my friend and I have respect for him, I guess. (I've made it sound like it was awful, but it was really a nice dream and I enjoyed it.)"
"430-02"	"#430-02 (7th grader, 01/17/97) I drove in my friend Chloe's car and her mom dropped us off on some unrecognizable road. Chloe, another friend, and I played on the street for a while, then rollerbladed (or maybe ice skated) to like a movie theater/bar/disco. The movie playing was a horror movie. As I left walked through the bar into the disco. Chloe and Robin eventually joined me, then Chloe's mom picked us up again, and dropped us off at the road we'd started on. We then discovered that one of the houses on the block belonged to our principal. Then we stole a bottle of Peach Nectarine sparkling juice that was outside his house, drank most of it...I can't remember past there... Setting: First on a suburban road I didn't recognize, then in a movie theater, a bar, and a disco. Characters: My friend Chloe, my friend Robin, Chloe's mom, and maybe my principal, though I'm not sue he actually made an appearance; oh, yes, and a guy named Atum who appeared very briefly. Feelings and Thoughts: I don't remember. I think it's a little odd that we were stealing sparkling juice from the principal, but it doesn't surprise me that we were trying to be stupid and rebellious."
"430-03"	"#430-03 (7th grader, 01/18/97) Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why. Setting: Inside something that was star-shaped, and made of rubber, blown up like a balloon; some parking lot, unrecognizable. Characters: There were three bats with red eyes; I think my friend Chloe got in there (she went camping with us this summer); some man who I think represented my dad; the My school 7th-8th girls. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, shocked. Bats and camping are a little weird, but I think seeing my father shot (which probably came from some movie I watched) is a little disturbing. What could it symbolize? Nothing, I hope."
"430-04"	"#430-04 (7th grader, 01/20/97) All I remember is being a caterpillar (I think I was male, because I remember coming ""home from work"" and finding my wife already there). We were in a cherry tree. The first dream I can only remember hugging a fairly young boy, and his two older brothers saying something along the lines of ""Don't become too attached."" The dream after (before the caterpillars) I as in the Nature Company store, or maybe a science museum gift shop. Setting: In a cherry tree; I don't remember the next one; in a museum gift shop. Characters: My caterpillar wife; a boy of about 10; his older brothers of about 16-17 (I recognized none of them). I think I saw Anna (an 8th grade girl at My school). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. The dream I wrote down second is the one that interests me the most. I know there was more to it, and it was a lot more complicated, but my mind just moved on to the caterpillar home."
"570-01"	"#570-01 (8th grader, 01/22/97) I dreamt I was lying in the snow in Alaska and was having seizures and nobody was coming to help me. That's because I realized in my dream that I was actually in my bed. In my dream, I was dreaming. (In real life, when I woke up, I found I had a fever of 102 degrees and was chilled. I was having violent convulsions and my throat was dry from coughing. My head was bleeding because I hit my head on the bedside table during one of my convulsions. Nobody had come to help me.) Setting: In my bed, in my home. Characters: It was only me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, sick, alone. I have no idea where it came from, but I think my mind was just reacting to my body movements in my sleep."
"570-02"	"#570-02 (8th grader, 01/22/97) I was lying on my bed in my room, but everything in my room was on fire. I couldn't get my covers off me and my vision started to blur. I saw my great-grandmother coming through the fire to get to me and take me up to Heaven with her. I walked to the door where she was. Then I was whizzing through a tunnel with her while a golden light was pulling us on. I loved it. (Real: when I woke up my mom was shaking me and she said that I hadn't been breathing and she couldn't find a pulse on me.) Setting: First in my bed, then through a gray tunnel that was really windy. Characters: My great-grandmother was in my dream to take me to Heaven. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy when I saw my great-grandmother; scared my room was on fire; relaxed & excited in the tunnel. I think I might have had a ""near-death"" experience. When I woke up I wanted to go back to the golden light and my great grandmother. I have always wanted to meet her and I finally got to. But now that I think about it, I almost died. This strengthens my faith in God even more, because now I know that he wants me to live even just a little while longer. My fever was 105 degrees when I woke up."
"570-03"	"#570-03 (8th grader, 01/23/97) I had just spent the night over at my best friend's house and we were waking up on a gorgeous spring morning. She had to go to school, but I didn't, so I wanted to go with her. She lives less than a block away from her school, and I was jealous that she could wake up at 7:30 and make it to school by 8. I was shaving my legs with her electric razor and then we went into her back yard and went swimming in the cool water. Setting: At my friend's house. Characters: My best friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, refreshed. I think I want all this rain to stop and I want it to be spring. I LOVE spring!"
"570-04"	"#570-04 (8th grader, 01/24/97) It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home & met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) & his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head & shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like ""(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!"" Then back to the girl & guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it. Setting: All different places, but I didn't recognize them. Characters: I don't know any of the people. Feelings and Thoughts: ? It was weird. I've never dreamed a cartoon. I wasn't even in it!"
"573-01"	"#573-01 (8th grader, 01/23/97) I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, ""You aren't using my sister to get to me?"" I said no and he said, ""I don't want my sister to get hurt."" Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me & Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him. Setting: At camp, at a beach, in Woodside, at an all-boys school. Characters: Frank & R. Both were ex-crushes I had decided that I didn't like any more the night I had the dream. The two girls are my friends. I didn't know who the other person was. Frank looked different than he normally does. I met him like I met my current crush, Eli. Feelings and Thoughts: Anxious, in love, happy, sad. I woke up thinking Frank loved me until I remembered it was only a dream. I was scared when the person told me the people had died in the year 226."
"573-02"	"#573-02 (8th grader, 01/24/97) I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said ""I never even auditioned for the parts."" Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet. Setting: It took place at the stage (where) we usually had our performing night at school. It also took place at school. Characters: Steve is the director and the middle school head, and plays heavy favorites. Liz is a really popular ""strong"" actress, she never fells (sic) the parts. Melissa is a really homely person who is Steve's favorite and Carol is an okay actress. Liz is Steve's (illegible). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, cheated, mad. I felt sad that I never got a chance and Steve would cast me as the part I wanted no matter now good I was."
"573-03"	"#573-03 (8th grader, 01/25/97) We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love. Setting: school, I am applying to. At a gourmet food store. Strange building. Funny building. Characters: Monique de Brian is a really excellent World Cup fencer. Jacob is my teacher. The admissions director from school - who is actually a man. The boy - a kid from church. Lorna, a 9th grader. Courtney & Melissa, school friends. Feelings and Thoughts: (blank)"
"573-04"	"#573-04 (8th grader, 02/01/97) I was in Northern British Columbia and I was walking down a street. At the end of the street was a beautiful lake. I was wearing goggles and I found that I couldn't see very well without them off. I went into a drug store but I could buy anything. I realized this was where I wanted to live. My friends were making snowballs near the lake. They were wearing ski clothes. Setting: British Columbia, Canada, in a small town. Characters: Emily, a good friend; Will, a boy I know not very well; and a store keeper. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I wanted to see clearly without my goggles, but I couldn't. I felt trapped."
"575-01"	"#575-01 (8th grader, 01/21/97) I was at My school but it didn't look like My school. Stuff happened that I can't remember. The me and a few other friends went to the classroom next to where were sleeping. It looked like classroom 2 at school, but had more stuff in it. My friend A. said that tequila tastes good with tortillas. I didn't find this at all strange. So we go into the classroom and ask if there are any tortillas. They say no but that there is pita bread, so we go in there and everyone else disappears. We look under the sink, which isn't in classroom 2 really, and underneath are big jugs (those square kind that cleaning stuff comes in) and they are kind of see-through and there is yellow-whitish liquid inside. On them they say something I don't remember. Anyway we pour the tequila into margarita glasses and eat it with pita bread. Some stuff happens. (I think that it has gotten later but I'm not sure.) An elderly black man comes in and says he has to check us. We immediately think he's talking about us drinking tequila. I'm the type who would break down and tell everything we were doing. I look, about to laugh at this black girl to my right (A.'s on my left). She put her long dark red nails in her mouth (a normal gesture as if biting her nails), and leans her head down and tells me no (don't tell). The man goes and checks behind a mirror inside a mirror like the illustration. Behind, there are some photos. Inside were the photos that showed the snake that bit one of the teachers. This was a big mystery, solved. Then we went away. I think later there was a big commotion with the teacher who had been bit. Setting: At my school. Everything was kind of the same but a little changed. Characters: My friend A. Schoolmates, kind a generic ""classmates"" - didn't know them. The black guy was mysterious. The black girl was the only person I recognized and communicated with other than my friend A., and one man. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It was very weird but I told my mom I smoked marijuana once and maybe the tequila is related."
"575-02"	"#575-02 (8th grader, 01/27/97) I was with my family. We went to buy something at a store and I found this CD I kind of wanted so I put it in a bag. Then I tried on these ugly rainbow-colored shoes. I put these in a bag. Later, we're driving and I see that I have stolen both these things, which I didn't mean to do. Then we see some black gangsters fighting and my mom sighs, ""please don't start."" Then they start punching people out and Tupac gets rolled in front of our car & starts screaming something at us. Setting: In a shoe/CD store. Also on a street from a car-windshield point of view. Characters: My family in the dream was just a generic family, I don't know them. Tupac is a famous rapper who died. He had some good songs. The gangsters were random, but one was Snoop Doggy Dog (also a famous rapper but he's alive). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, indifferent. Well, yesterday I was looking at pictures of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac. Even though in my dream Tupac looked nothing like Tupac, Snoop Doggy Dogg looked the same."

The guy who wins says, ""Well, then suck this."" He puts his penis all over the other guy's mouth. Later they are walking on rocky hills and the guy who lost is wiping his mouth with a towel and saying ""Aw, that's disgusting."" Setting: Out in nature, a lot of rocks.

"575-04"	"#575-04 (8th grader, 01/30/97) I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while. Setting: Most of it took place in the classroom at my school. Some of it took place in my room. Characters: Steve Smuin is my teacher and the school principal. My whole class, the whole 8th grade, was in the dream. I know them all. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, surprised. I felt like this really happened. One weird thing that I just realized is that my hair in the dream was straight, smooth, shiny. This wasn't really out of the ordinary. If it weren't for the hair-cutting, I wouldn't even have noticed it as a dream, not a memory. The feelings I had were really normal for being at my school."

Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder.

Setting: In a meeting hall like at camp. Characters: The lady was like a counselor. She was taller than everyone else in the room. The boy had dark hair and an intelligent face. The people at the table didn't have any definite features. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I was angry because the boy would not talk to me."
"597-03"	"#597-03 (8th grader, 03/31/97) I left the building and went to the kitchen area of the camp. My older sister was there and she introduced me to the other kitchen staff. She also showed me a picture of the kitchen staff. There were some ghosts in it and then my sister tried to introduce me to air. Then the kitchen made me be in a team go-cart race. My little sister was on my team. We fought over the go-cart we got. I got a go-cart away from the rest of my team. We were doing fine and I as in the lead when all of a sudden I went down a hill and the track forked. I took the right path and it went down a steep hill and entered a room, but there seemed to be no way out but a staircase. So I climbed the staircase and went along the track. I was having a great time and I was sure I won when I got to the finish line ahead of everybody else. Then the referee said that I was disqualified because I didn't have my go cart. I looked down and he was right. I had left it at the bottom of the stairs. I had thought I was still in it. Soon the rest of the go-carts came in. Setting: In the camp kitchen and on a go-cart track. Characters: My older sister and the kitchen staff, my younger sister and a whole bunch of other go-cart drivers, a referee. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, embarrassed. I was angry at my sister and I thought she might be insane. I was happy because I had gotten the go-cart I wanted and I was ahead of everything else. I was embarrassed because I had thought I was still in the go-cart when I wasn't."
"597-04"	"#597-04 (8th grader, 04/05/97) I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north. Setting: In the country with lots of woods and a lake nearby. Characters: There was the person I was searching with, the mad man, the tricky woman, the townspeople, the other kids, my little sister, the lady with balloons, and the people from the north. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, excited. (Angry) when I ran into the wall and the man was being treated badly. I also felt excited when I started to fly."
"601-01"	"#601-01 (9th grader, 01/26/97) I was talking to Katie on the phone and suddenly realized that I had pictures of both Glenn and Chloe. She was excited and wanted to come over. Setting: I was at home in the computer room. Characters: Katie, my best friend from the middle school. She's never met Chloe, my other best friend, or Glenn, the guy I've had a bad crush on for 3 months. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, love.

"601-02"	"#601-02 (9th grader, 01/27/97) A male narrator said that women become infatuated with men who don't love them. I saw a black and white picture of several couples with the female beaming and the male with an uneasy look on his face. Setting: No identifiable setting. Characters: Various unknown couples in their 20s, and a male narrator. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, disbelief. My mom was trying to convince me yesterday not to date."
"601-03"	"#601-03 (9th grader, 01/28/97) It made sense at the time. I travelled across a lake halfway submerged in a boat type thing several times to a large cave in the side of a cliff. There were some people in the dream. Setting: An unknown lake. Characters: An unknown 20-something male and some unclear people. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, dutiful."

"602-01"	"#602-01 (9th grader, 01/20/97) I had just finished swim practice and I was going to get a ride home with my friend but the car was full so I biked home. I had done it many times before but at this one street I couldn't remember which way to go. I would choose one way, ride on it for a while, then turn back when I realized it wouldn't take me home. Then there was this bell all over the city, like a school bell, which said summer vacation had started. Suddenly everyone was gone on vacation and I was still lost. Setting: All over San Francisco. Characters: I was alone. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. It's weird because I have never gotten lost before. I was worried in the dream because I thought I wouldn't ever get home."
"602-02"	"#602-02 (9th grader, 01/20/97) I was skiing with my friend Chloe's older brother, and we were going to meet her at the bottom of the mountain to leave. We decided we just had to go up one more lift to ski down. When we got to the top he wanted to eat, but I didn't want to be late meeting my friend. I got mad and he stayed to eat, and I went down the hill. Setting: At a ski resort. Characters: My friend Chloe, who takes me skiing, and her brother who I don't really like (I think Chloe and I got separated and I ended up with him). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, frustrated."
"602-03"	"#602-03 (9th grader, 01/21/97) I was a dog and I was running around in someone's backyard for a while. Then this guy came out (I was with my two other dog friends) and started chasing us. My two friends ran out the door in the fence, but he closed it and I snuck out under the fence. Then the whole dream started over again and I didn't get out, but my friends did and I got mad. I had to go scrub walls as a punishment. Setting: In a backyard I've never seen before. Characters: The two other dogs were my friends, except I got mad at them when they got away and I didn't. I know the two friends represented my friends Julia and Erin. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried. I got mad at my friends when they got out and I didn't."
"602-04"	"#602-04 (9th grader, 01/22/97) I was in a swimming pool with Julia and Erin, and there was dirt on the ground of the pool, so when you swam across the middle you weren't allowed to put your feet on the ground. These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed. Setting: In a pool. Characters: I'm sure Julia was there, plus Erin and my drama teacher and two guys. I didn't interact very much with the two characters, they just kind of followed me around. Feelings and Thoughts: Mellow. I had a fight with my mom yesterday. Julia was really supportive and nice 'cause I was upset. Maybe that's why she was in the dream."
"603-01"	"#603-01 (9th grader, 01/25/97) I was at swim practice. My whole class was there. We all changed and went outside and got in the pool and started swimming. The pool was much larger than usual, and about 40 feet deep. I heard that my friend Louis was walking through the building, so I wanted to see him and I got out as soon as I could, but he had left when I got outside. Setting: At the pool where my team practices. Characters: All my friends from school and Louis, who was my friend from summer camp last summer. I haven't seen him since then. I wish I could. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, disappointed, frustrated. I wish I could have caught up with him in time."
"603-02"	"#603-02 (9th grader, 01/26/97) I was an Indian on a reservation but it was also a ski resort. All day we went up and down the mountain. There was a border which was marking white man's land. There was a bathroom right across it. I really had to go so I did. Because I trespassed I started this whole war, and the whites started invading and attacking us. It was cold, and I managed to get a fire started to keep warm, and all the Indians were huddled around it while the whites moved closer and closer in on us. Setting: At an Indian reservation which was a ski resort. Characters: I don't think I knew any of the other people there, but I wasn't lonely or anything, that's just the way it is. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Maybe I dreamed about Indians because we are studying the Battle of Wounded Knee, and we are reading a book about reservations."
"603-03"	"#603-03 (9th grader, 01/27/97) I was on a cruise and it was summer. A waiter, Brandon, always brought me ice cream. Suddenly everybody started getting sick and dying, so I decided to leave the boat before I died. I swam for a long time, and I got to this island with nothing but fruit trees. I lived there for a while, but I was lonely although I was otherwise happy. Then a rescue plane came and took me home. Setting: First on a huge boat, then on an island, then in a plane, then home. Characters: I didn't know any people except a waiter on the boat who always brought me ice cream. His name was Brandon. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, lonely. The cruise might have been because I have been wanting to go on a cruise with my friend in the summer. We're trying to plan it."
"603-04"	"#603-04 (9th grader, 01/28/97) I was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and the Witch was chasing me around this pillar inside the castle. We kept going around and around for the longest time, but it was never repetitive at all. She never caught me. Setting: In the Witch's castle. Characters: Just the Witch, and my dog Toto. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, hate. It's weird, because I haven't seen the Wizard of Oz for at least four years. I don't know why I had it."
"604-01"	"#604-01 (9th grader, 01/29/97) I was having a birthday party and my friends started to arrive at my house. But before I knew it there were hundreds of people in my house who I didn't know.

I took a shower and used their shampoo, when I got my friend's brother started screaming how the shampoo cost hundreds of dollars and he was going to kill me.

Setting: At my friend Marissa's huge mansion of a house. Characters: My good friend, Marissa, and her psychotic brother, Scott. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared."
"604-03"	"#604-03 (9th grader, 01/31/97) I was a Carebear from the show ""Carebears"" and my Carebear friends and I were riding around on rainbows and having a good time.

"604-04"	"#604-04 (9th grader, 01/31/97) I had a younger sister who ran away.

I think I was my older brother. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, uncaring."
"605-01"	"#605-01 (9th grader, 01/26/97) My cousin's friend was over who I'd never met but always wanted to meet. When I saw Michael's friend I couldn't believe it 'cause he was tall and fine and looked about 14! (I'm 13.)

Setting: At my house in San Jose where we don't live at, but my family and Michael's family lived. Characters: Michael, my 9-year old cousin. Miguel, Michael's best friend who I heard so much about but never met. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, confused.

"605-02"	"#605-02 (9th grader, 01/28/97) I was trying to see if I could make a compost pile with a pile of old clothes, and this big yellow bug started flying after me. And then my alarm went off. I woke up and went back to sleep (in my dream). Setting: In my kitchen and in my bed. Characters: My mom and the big yellow bug were the only ones in the kitchen. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I hate waking up twice. Sometimes I'll dream that I woke up, took a shower, do all that and sometimes make it all the way to school, before I really wake up."
"605-03"	"#605-03 (9th grader, 01/30/97) All I remember is the end of the dream: I was at a typical My school party, out on one of our many lawns, eating little sandwiches, and little cookies, and drinking tea, on a fairly cheerful Sunday afternoon. Then I went home and started making myself a brownie (just one) when my mom started asking me questions about a guy she thought I liked. Setting: At My school, then in my kitchen. Characters: My school students, teachers, parents, no one I recognized in particular, and my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, confused. All I can say is I remember liking this guy back in first grade, but haven't thought of him since."
"605-04"	"#605-04 (9th grader, 01/31/97) I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer. Then we were doing the play, and the music was all off, so we had to improvise in front of the audience. Then I was really made at Olive (who happens to be my worst enemy), so I called her a bitch and then I woke up. Setting: In a theater, and backstage. Characters: summer camp actors; Olive, my worst enemy. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Olive was being really bitchy yesterday, so I know where that came from."
"606-01"	"#606-01 (9th grader, 01/21/97) Me and my brother Max were swimming in the ocean. I jumped off a cliff to join him, and we decided we'd stay there overnight. So then we had to go to higher ground, and we hiked up a bunch of hills as the sun was setting (it was really pretty), then found a cabin we could stay in, that nobody else was using. Then my parents stopped by to make sure everything was okay, and that I had taken my contacts out. Setting: In the ocean along the beach, in kind of a hilly area surrounding the ocean, in a cabin. Characters: My brother, and my parents who came at the end of the dream. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. It was a nice dream, because it was really pretty, what with the ocean and the sunset."
"606-02"	"#606-02 (9th grader, 01/23/97) I went to summer camp, met a girl who liked my straightforwardness, and she gave me some false eyelashes. I remember thinking I'd forgotten all my hair products. Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was ""I wanna fuck you up."" So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember. I don't remember the ending. Setting: A summer camp (I'm not sure when/where). Characters: The first girl who I don't know; the little boy I didn't know either; the guy I eventually fell in love with looked a lot like my friend's older brother; the las man and/or Judy Garland seemed familiar.

"606-03"	"#606-03 (9th grader, 01/24/97) All I an remember is going through a house then into a garden maze. It turned out to be one of those ""group"" skills activities, but it took me a while to find my group. They had found many clues already, so I wasn't that helpful. I think we won. Setting: In someone's house, there's a maze. Characters: Glenn, Anna, Robin and/or other person. Feelings and Thoughts: Smart. Kind of a skimpy dream."
"606-04"	"#606-04 (9th grader, 01/26/97) The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang ""I will always love you."" Setting: In a car along some fairly busy road; Sally's house/loft; in some sort of computer game; at a Club Med with a 50-foot flying trapeze. Characters: A bunch of friends, though I distinctly remember Jon, Sally and Brian; nobody in the computer dream; my brother and mom I don't quite remember, but my dad and his friend Joel, and his two daughters were definitely there, and the trapeze guy, and Whitney Houston. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, terrified. I know the trapeze thing must have come from when I asked my dad last night what ""fear of heights"" was and he said acrophobia. I think my brother was playing computer games like that. And I was listening to the radio last night so Whitney Houston probably came from there."
"607-01"	"#607-01 (9th grader, 01/25/97) I was at a dance at my school, but I didn't recognize anyone. Everything was very dark and very blurry. Then, I saw my boyfriend, Noah, across the room.

Setting: Toystore & my house. Characters: My dad and my best friend, Sandy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. It was a very thrilling experience to fly."

I got very nervous just thinking about it."
"608-01"	"#608-01 (9th grader, 01/23/97) I remember hardly nothing about this dream.

Setting: In classroom 2, where we have math. Characters: Liz, Laura, Anne, Will, Jeannette, Anna and I - everyone is in the advanced math group with me. Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated.

We were collecting clothes, except people would come by, take off their clothes, throw them in the collection pile, and walk off. That's all I remember. Setting: We were sitting on a counter, but I think it was outside. Characters: The people from my gymnastics class: the teacher, Billy, and the two other girls, Kelly and Leticia. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, cheerful. We've been collecting for Wee Care at school. Nina and I just had gymnastics last night."
"608-03"	"#608-03 (9th grader, 01/26/97) It was a really windy night. The wind blew my back door open. My cat got outside. (Once outside, she gets scared of people.) I went out into the backyard to call for her, but it was really windy and whenever I would call for her the wind would carry my voice away. Then she was sitting on the garden gate laughing at me, and I couldn't move towards her because the wind was too strong. Setting: My house, and my backyard. Characters: Me and Lucky Blue, my cat.

Nina and I didn't go to school, so we set up the room, and Laura was supposed to come between 12:15 and 12:45 so everyone came, and we were sitting around waiting for Laura to come. She didn't come, and it was 1:00, so I went someplace to wait for her. 1:30, and she wasn't coming. So I phoned school, and Emily answered. She said, ""Hilary, are you coming to school?"" and I said, ""No."" Then I asked, ""Has Laura left yet?"" and she said, ""She left 19 minutes ago."" So I went back to the party room and I don't remember anything after that. Setting: (A party room and someplace else.) Characters: (Me, Laura, Emily, and some other people.)

"609-01"	"#609-01 (9th grader, 04/05/97) I was walking down an alley when I came to a corner onto a big street. On the corner inside a big door a girl and boy were making a mattress. The girl hated me but the boy was my friend and he came out to talk with me. Then he held a model helicopter above his head and started to fly, so I followed him. Then we sat on a ridge coming out of a building. He said he could fly like me now but not without the helicopter. All of a sudden the ridge we were on broke, and we fell. Then further down the street I saw a lady in a business suit coming towards us. I started to run, but she was able to catch me. I tried to get away by flying but she was holding onto me so tight I could hardly get off the ground. Then she took me to a store that reminded me of Korea. Then she said I could have anything I wanted but I refused. Then the people from the north came by and got me away from the lady and took me skiing in some odd apparel. Setting: Felt like New York City. Characters: The boy, the girl, the lady in the suit, the family from the north. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. Happy that the boy could fly.

The I left and went though a thin hallway that had barred windows in it, with people's hands reaching out and touching me. Then I came to a room filled with weird people. I even saw a rat person come out from under the table. The owner of the place took him away. Then I became friends with the owner and he told me that some people were coming to look at the prison soon. He asked me my opinion of the place. I suggested that he doesn't let them go through the hallway with the hands. So we built another hallway with nothing in it. Setting: A room with cages against the wall and then the hallway and then a smoke filled room with neon lights. Characters: The prisoners were mostly insane, but the owner seemed sort of okay. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. Scared of the prisoners in the hallway and in the room."

The were running down a very steep ridge with pink fire coming out of their mouths, eyes, and hands. Then two aliens came along dressed in long robes and pointy hats. The took the power from the humans, and were soon spitting fire too. They were also male and female, though I saw the female most. Then two different humans came along who seemed to be Adam and Eve.

Setting: First next to a steep ridge in a forest, then in a big room with sleeping bags all over. Characters: First the two humans and the aliens, and then Adam and Eve.

She says she wants to show him something while they're in engineering. She beckons him behind a tree into a garden; he is confused. She takes two willow branches off a tree and I get the feeling she is about to start the Klingon mating ritual. The next thing I know I am in a bedroom. The son is in a bed with his grandma (I guess there wasn't enough room). Be'lanna was standing next to the bed. Also the whole alien delegation is in there and everyone is wearing ceremonial robes, even Be'lanna and the people in bed.

"610-02"	"#610-02 (9th grader, 03/11/97) I went to a huge store with my dad and my brother. We were shopping and I saw a bunch of nail polish. Some of it was hard candy, a brand of nail polish that has a ring on it and it's really expensive. There was a color exactly like the color of my new shirt. There was also protector. I got both of those. Setting: A store. Characters: My brother - 9 years old. Dad - tall. I don't know the other people in the store. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I've been looking for a hard candy color that matches my shirt and protector. It was a great dream."
"610-03"	"#610-03 (9th grader, 03/15/97) We were going on a trip and I left my CD player in the house. I went back to get it and the piano was playing by itself. I tripped and fell and I saw someone in the living room. It was my dad but he scared the living daylights out of me. Then the scene changed and everyone was in the living room. Then my dad wanted to show me something upstairs. We went upstairs into my bathroom. It was different because there was a place where a light bulb should be above the bathtub and there weren't any shells on the shelf. My dad said there was this voice that gave him nightmares and was in them. He said it came from here. I told him to tell it to laugh and it did. It was the scariest laugh I've ever heard. But I wasn't scared for some reason and I just yelled back at it. I tried to find where it was coming from and it was coming from the heater. I tried to rip up the heater but it was too hot. Then my dad said it was the ghost of a football coach. The I woke up really freaked out. Setting: My house. Characters: My family - same as always. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, freaked out. It was a really scary nightmare."
"610-04"	"#610-04 (9th grader, 02/02/97) I was with my fencing class and we were on a retreat with some of my friends. I kept on asking why Eli was being so mean to me. Everyone said he was stressed about colleges. We had to do posters of people's qualities and Linda showed us two ways to do them. I was going to do Eli and then apologize to him. I asked him how to spell his name even though I hoped he wouldn't know I was doing him. He answered ""Greuff/m."" We were by the ocean on a narrow trail. I wanted to tell him how I felt but he had left. Then we were back at the gym. My friend Gia was there and she was in a green skating dress. Linda tried to describe how Gia was skating a special part in our show. Then she asked who Evita was and then she explained who she was. Gia thought she was the Embassy Suites and I knew who she was, but I couldn't seem to say it. Then the gym turned into a skating rink and everyone started skating around. Gia raised her leg and did a spiral. Setting: A meeting room that turned into a skating rink, and a cliff, and a gym. Characters: Eli, a boy a used to like; Linda, my fencing teacher; Gia from my soccerteam. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, worried. I felt disappointed that I couldn't tell him how I felt. I was beating around the bush."
