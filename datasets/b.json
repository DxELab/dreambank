    "description": "Barb Sanders (not her real name) is a middle-aged adult woman who has written down most of her dreams since about 1977. The series is ideal for detailed studies, for several reasons: (1) we have interviewed Sanders and her friends at length, so we can provide background information after analyses are made; (2) we have done numerous studies of the dreams that can be built upon with new methods -- these studies are discussed in Chapter 5 of G. William Domhoff's book The Scientific Study of Dreams (2003); (3) the series is so extensive that it is extremely useful for studying subsets on specific issues (e.g., how she interacts with her ex-husband Howard, or how she reacted to an infatuation with Derek, or how she conceives of each of her three siblings and three children, or how she conceives of cats and dogs, or what happens when she is on or near bridges).  For the \"cast of characters\" in Barb Sanders' dreams, click here.  The full text of our interviews with her (in PDF format) is available here, and our detailed analysis of Barb Sanders' dream series -- our best case-study to date -- is here."
