    "description": "Emma is an elderly woman who wrote down her dreams from 1949 to 1951, and again from 1960 to 1997, although there are very few dreams or no dreams for a few of the years.  We have a considerable amount of biographical information on Emma that we can make available to researchers who carry out a blind analysis of the dreams."
