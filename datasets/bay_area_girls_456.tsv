I was with my friend Anna L., and Rita L., her mom, but it wasn't really Anna's mom - it was someone who looked like her mom. And then Rita got transported to the moon and told the people on the moon to take a man who looked like Al L. (Anna's father) and transport him to the moon. So they went down to earth (the people on the moon) to get the person who looked like Al, but Al - or rather the person who looked like him - did not want to go. The people who came from the moon told the person who looked like Al that the person who looked like Rita said to bring him to the moon. But then the person who resembled Rita said that she never said that. But the people from the moon said they had proof because they had one of Rita's 200 earrings. And that was the end.

"217-08"	"#217-08 (5th grader, undated) I don't know when I had this dream, but suddenly I remembered it: Me and some of my friends in my class at school that was studying ETs, were at a dry dusty place. In front of us was a very high ladder that led to a black blimp-shaped building. We climbed, and when we got to the top we couldn't open the door. It was really dangerous, and we all freaked out. Finally, we got the door open and walked into a nice room with a black leather couch. A man dressed in all black turned to us, surprised. He welcomed us in, but my friends were gone. He was an astronomer, so I stayed to get info for my class that was studying ET life, and somehow I agreed to stay for at least a week. But my parents had wanted me to come home. [Drawing of a blimp-shaped thing with a square cabin hanging below, suspended in space, with a ladder leading up to the cabin door. The blimp has three windows.

Suddenly, I was back at my school, doing a project you have to do for that class. The new class was nothing like my old class, and I hated it.

"219-01"	"#219-01 (5th grader, 01/18/97) I was saying ""miss"" and then there must have been an interruption/commotion. After, I think someone answered me with a rude remark. It was some sort of takeoff on a play and the part that I was reading, but the surroundings were not correct. It came and went quickly, or so it seemed. P.S. I think that I was so excited about this new dream journal that I tried to control my dream too much. That's why I can't elaborate. Setting: In a green room instead of a stage, as if the play was in real life. More like an office painted green. Characters: I was there, but as a different lady. Everyone else was unfamiliar. I think they were all busy, bustling around, with no time for my lady, even though she worked there with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. I don't think much of it. It seems normal, and this particular one, unlike others that I've had in the past, doesn't seem to be trying to get a message through to me."
"219-02"	"#219-02 (5th grader, 01/19/97) I was playing my violin with all my music friends. I am much more advanced than ""Twinkle, Twinkle"" but still, that's what we were performing. Last night I had a violin recital for real and played my hard pieces. At the end though, I played the duet to Twinkle. In my dream there was a girl at my level, or a bit above, who played Twinkle by herself, and then my other friends and I played duets but completely messed up. (This part didn't happen in real life.) Setting: It was on the stage: the same one from last night for real. Characters: There were all of my violin student friends. A group of girls who I play music with and goof off with. Some are a little bit spacey, but I still have fun with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, confused. I'm sort of wondering about it, because I know I did well in the real concert. I woke up with my arms in the violin position!"
"219-03"	"#219-03 (5th grader, 01/20/97) I was on some sort of a baseball team; a sport I don't care for and have only played twice when I was forced to in P.E. We were a bad team and always lost, though we hadn't really played any games yet. I didn't care if we won or not, but mostly I was concerned about the ball giving me a concussion. A very good team came to our field, but not for a game. One of them called out times of the day and then batted the ball where a clock would show it. For some reason two kids and I were trying to find a fence to put up somewhere, but we weren't successful at all. Setting: It was on a field I've not seen before, but sort of a combination of the school's and the one my brother's team plays at. Characters: There were mostly kids with a few coaches, our P.E. teacher from school was the assistant coach and the real coach was cruel. The kids on my team were a mishmash of grades, but were all from school. The two friends mentioned were in my grade. They were good friends of mine, but they really wanted to win as well as get the fence up. There were some kids on the other team from my school, but they were two grades above us at least. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I'm sort of curious if I'm going to enter a baseball team because I sure haven't been thinking about it!"
"219-04"	"#219-04 (5th grader, 01/21/97) I forget most of the dream, but I was at my friend's house with her, her mom and her dad, and I was answering phone calls. Nobody knew who I was and there were a lot of hangups. Setting: At my friend's house. It looked just the same. Characters: My friend, me, and her mom and dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Stupid. This happened yesterday, but there weren't so many hangups."
"219-05"	"#219-05 (5th grader, 01/22/97) My dream was very confusing, and at times impossible to understand. Therefore, I don't remember hardly any of it. The vague idea was I was lost. I think there was a big crowd of unfamiliar faces. Setting: Outside somewhere. Characters: A big crowd of people I didn't know. There was me, too. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I don't see why I can't remember. Parts of it I was forced to make up."
"219-06"	"#219-06 (5th grader, 01/23/97) I dreamt of acting in this play thing with my friends at school. I had what I thought was a really dumb part and our director was mean. We had to show another kid (some boy and I) down to where we were, and even though she wasn't supposed to be in the play, she kept sneaking in our room and singing out of tune with my singing group. The pianist was annoyed. Setting: In a spacy basement of our school which I've never seen. But every time I'm in a performance in a dream, that's where it is. Characters: They were boys and girls in my class, a cruel director that has never been mean in real life, and an annoyed pianist. Feelings and Thoughts: Annoyed. I hope I don't get a ""dumb"" part in the play I'm trying out for."
"219-07"	"#219-07 (5th grader, 01/25/97) I was with my real mom and she was driving me somewhere. When we came back home, there was a big commotion. My brother, who hated our step-uncle, was selling all of our step-uncle's possessions vigorously. He was selling them for money that didn't exist and he didn't care until my dad talked to him. My step-uncle came home and he was in big trouble. Setting: In the hallway, kitchen and garage of my house presently. Characters: My supposed brother was an enemy from school. I was me with my mom and dad. Our step-uncle was some classic cool guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. We're studying cashless society in school so that's where ""money that doesn't exist"" comes from, but I don't know about the rest. We don't have a step-uncle!"
"219-08"	"#219-08 (5th grader, 01/25/97) I was taking this crucial test that mattered for my outcome as an adult, even though I'm 10. My time was running out and I was nowhere near finishing.

Characters: The test-giver, who was only there in the beginning, and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. Today, in real life, my brother is taking a test and my dad was telling him last night how the outcome didn't matter at all."
"219-09"	"#219-09 (5th grader, 01/26/97) I was in a 1/2 P.E. class and 1/2 picnic with the P.E. teacher. It was a very odd situation. We were passing food and writing names on bits of paper: names for basketball partners. All of a sudden, some sort of low-flying, child-created, kid-driven aircraft came toward us. It touched some heads and playfully bumped a few of us purposely. When the 7th grade driver told us he could have injured us badly, I got terrified. Setting: Basketball court on a hill on which there was a picnic table. Characters: Half of my class now and half of the grade below us. The 7th grade driver was my brother's good friend. Our regular P.E. teacher was extra nice. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I have absolutely no idea where it came from except I wrote down the name of a long-lost friend on my basketball partner paper."
"219-10"	"#219-10 (5th grader, 01/27/97) I was at my friend's house and we were working on some sort of difficult long-lasting project which we never seemed to finish. Her computer didn't have the right software for the graph program that we needed, so we were asking all of the families on the block if they had it. When we got it, we wanted to put smiley faces on top of our graphs! Setting: At my friend's house, but it was slightly deformed. Characters: My friend, her mom and dad, me, her little brother, her friends and their parents. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. My friend and I finished our project awhile ago, and we didn't use smiley-faces, and we always had the right software."
"219-11"	"#219-11 (5th grader, 01/28/97) My cousin, aunt, step-uncle, friend, friend's friend, and grandma came over. They all seemed to know each other well, even though some have never met.

Characters: My mom, dad, sister, brother, me, my aunt, grandma, step-uncle, cousin, friend, and friend's friend. I know them all but they don't all know each other. (Sic - see #7"
"219-12"	"#219-12 (5th grader, 01/29/97) I was making this strange project for history. It was dome shaped and made out of many strips of written-on cardboard. It meant to demonstrate an immigrant's cycle and it incorporated a code. I think I was having fun with it. Setting: At school. Characters: Me and my dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I'm doing an immigrant project but it's just a biography in story form."
"219-13"	"#219-13 (5th grader, 01/30/97) We were home alone, my sister and brother and I, for quite a piece of the day. When mom was at home, we would always have visitors.

Setting: Outside on some pretty street. Characters: Mom, dad, sister, brother, me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I don't know where in the world it came from."
"219-14"	"#219-14 (5th grader, 02/01/97) We were eating dinner, but it also seemed like we were playing a game, because our conversation was of that sort, and we didn't do the things that ought to be done when having dinner. When we had ""finished,"" my sister volunteered to clear, rinse and load the dishes (which were all plates), and she put them in a skinny stack. When she ran them under water they turned into a deck of cards. Setting: At our kitchen table. Characters: My sister and I (unchanged). Feelings and Thoughts: Weirded. It's strange."
"220-01"	"#220-01 (5th grader, 01/20/97) I was at a sewing class and you picked out your design on the computer. The lady that was teaching us how to sew took me outside.

"360-01"	"#360-01 (6th grader, 01/18/97) Well, I remember two teenagers, I guess they were my brother and sister because our father gave us each four million dollars. I remember the girl saying that that was not enough, but our father had already gone. Our house was on an island and when the boy went out on his boat two sharks chased him and he ended up on the shore, in the arms of the police. The whole time, the girl was smiling, then she sailed over to a cave in a big rock, and that was the last I saw of her. I remember buying a sweatshirt with my four million dollars. Actually, I did see the girl. She was walking in with me from when I had bought my sweatshirt. Then I saw her again, sitting on the couch, talking to our dad. Setting: On an island. Our house was the only thing on the island so it wasn't very big.

But then when we got there, there was nowhere to go. When I looked to my LEFT I saw the inside of my house. I don't remember what was on the right. When I got up from the spot I was in, I walked into the big room and Courtlyn asked me if I wanted to have the other shirt and shorts that Holly gave her.

I remember a butterfly sitting on the ground in front of our shower, and I think we took of its wings and put them on the shower wall. Somehow I think it turned into a person, because later this guy said, ""Where can I change?"" or ""Is there a good place to change?"" I was in a big group so I don't really know the details.

When we got there we just stood there for a moment feeling the wall. Then we went inside to the office and were looking around when a guy walked in. Then he started talking to us, and I had a bad feeling about him. Somehow we captured him and the guys asked the other girl to slit his scalp. She did and then suddenly he shoved us all away from him and his head was one of an alien. Then he pulled out his gun and started shooting at us. We were chased around for a while, when I tripped right in front of him. He aimed his gun at me and said, ""Now you can't escape me."" I thought he was going to fire, but at the last second he put his gun up and shot at something else. Then he fell over because someone shot him.

After we came out we discovered that a lot of cars were still there, so we explored the cars. Later, my friend pushed his sister on the gravel and she got an injury on her head, it wasn't bad though, just a little cut. Later we were playing this game with some kids, we could tune our ears to hear what they were saying. Also my friend kept going to the little trailer park to visit this woman and man.

"360-10"	"#360-10 (6th grader, 01/30/97) I was on an island with my dad and brother, and we had to get back to the mainland.

"360-11"	"#360-11 (6th grader, 01/31/97) I know I switched characters a couple of times. I remember landing on a planet. I was watching out for this little brother and sister. When I located them, I became the sister, but the brother got older too. Well, anyway, the place I was in was full of people with earrings, nose rings, lip rings, etc. I was the odd one, I was wearing cords and a white shirt. Then this guy came over and made me go to the dance floor. He said that this girl wanted to dance with the guy but wanted to see how he danced. I was the tester. The guy took my hands and flung me way up to the ceiling then he swung me back up to the other corner. After this had continued for a while, I decided to stop when the ride was over. Also, the music stopped. Then I was sitting by this big water tunnel thing and an alarm went off. Somehow the water was leaking. I looked next to me and saw that a bag had broken and was spilling out water. I told them that. Then I held the bag closed. Somebody said that people were already going through the escape tunnel, so I went over and put my foot in the way so the next person couldn't go. Then I explained why. That's all I remember except that I think that the brother and sister traveled through space and time at random. Setting: Another planet, on an island, in a restaurant. Characters: I only knew one person, and that was possibly my brother, who in the dream was a boy I know at My school. Everyone else I didn't know. Oh!

"360-12"	"#360-12 (6th grader, 02/01/97) I was at school and one of the teachers came by and gave me these two bottles. When he poured them in the same spot and it blew up. Before he came by, I was asking a different teacher for some money to buy some snacks. He told me he had some in his car. I went to put all of this stuff in my locker.

I was tumbling on the floor along with everyone else, when this woman came in and started talking about her divorce. Everyone sat down and listened for some strange reason, and I remember her mentioning her two daughters (one was there), Arizona, and a hot air balloon. Then she left and everybody went back to what they were doing. Then she came back with a HUGE cardboard box that contained her divorced husband, her other daughter, and her poodle. She talked about all of them, and said we could pet her dog. Zena said, ""Uh, does your dog - ?"" ""Oh, yes,"" said the woman, ""You'd better not pet it."" I somehow knew that she meant to ask if her dog gave off a scent because she was getting a dog. I then woke up. Setting: The gym, where I take gymnastics. Characters: Zena, a friend I have known all my life, a bit too cautious. Kerri, Jaycee and Shannon - Olympic gymnasts. I've never met them.

In the daytime we were walking along the street when my mom told us to stop. This was because she saw a T-shirt/bathing suit stand with a Jr. Bach T-shirt. She got one, and I did, too.

"361-03"	"#361-03 (6th grader, 01/19/97) I was in a classroom at my school and was sitting in a circle with a teacher and a group of people. The teacher brought in some strawberries that were in a huge crate. None of them were ripe, but she didn't seem to notice. She passed them around for everyone to take a handful. Laura commented about them, but only I heard her. Then the teacher brought out really bruised peaches and passed them around too. ""Anyone who likes to make sherbet, these work really well,"" said the teacher. ""Peaches are my favorite fruit,"" I said to Zena. Later in the car, Leah's friend Mindy had gotten the extra peaches and was carrying them in a plastic bag. ""Can I have one?"" I asked. ""Sure."" ""Can I?"" asked Zena. ""Yeah."" ""Can I?"" Leah asked. ""Leah, you already have two."" ""NO"" said Leah, keeping the O on her lips. ""Yeah, they're in that bag."" Leah started sulking. ""Come on you guys, hey, guess what?"" said Terri.

"361-04"	"#361-04 (6th grader, 01/21/97) The science teacher, Melissa, was showing us pictures of science projects, and she came to one of a girl lying on her stomach with her head to the side. Next to her was her lunchbox. Melissa told us what happened. She was doing an experiment to see if she could tell why her lunchbox was making weird noises. She had her project set up in the middle of a freeway (don't ask why). When she opened the lunchbox this poisonous gas came out and put her unconscious. The police somehow knew about it and came. They told her to put on a gas mask next time, so she did and completed the project. Setting: At school, but Melissa's story within the dream took place on the freeway.

We ended up in one room at My school, where a party was going on. I knew that Charles was in there too, and we couldn't escape him and he couldn't escape us. My parents were there too, and so was Courtlyn's dad, but not Courtlyn. Charles had a power to change into other people, not change change, but good makeup change. My brother was there too. Zena and I tried to find out who he was, and my dad helped too. We were sure he was this robot walking around, but we dismantled it and he wasn't in there.

"361-06"	"#361-06 (6th grader, 01/25/97) First of all, I remember two things in the dream that weren't related to anything. A front yard of a neighbor to My school, and a HUGE building that my dad drove me to that was some kind of palace. The person of importance there had a collection of big TinTin postcards hanging on a low wall. But the main part of the dream was that in P.E. we studied the first Olympics. Each of us got a randomly chosen sport, and I got the marathon. I had to draw a picture of a person running it. For some reason, I wanted to draw them holding a torch, but I woke up after my first try which looked like this: (picture). Setting: At school, at the palace, and on the neighbor's front lawn. Characters: My dad - drove to the palace for a work related reason. Person of importance - liked Tintin. I didn't know him, but he looked like Nestor, Captain Haddock's butler.

"361-08"	"#361-08 (6th grader, 01/29/97) I was at Hashy camp in Australia, and we were going to do this activity called the field game. It was freezing cold so Adam and I went into our dark room, to change. We tried to turn on the lights, but there was no switch that we could find. There were a bunch of weird things that we tried to switch, but the best we did was dimming green lights around the room. The problem? They only stayed dimmed. One time, I tried to find a switch and by accident rubbed my hand over some wires. I thought I would get electrocuted, but I didn't. I finally got changed in the dark. The game started by this boy catapulting a big stone off a cliff, and these big men had to hold him back from falling off the cliff. Setting: Hashy camp, out of Melbourne, Australia. Characters: My brother - not very helpful, usually. Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated. It was actually kind of what happened at Hashy camp, but no green lights. What I mean is that the light switches were hard to find and there was a ""field game."""
"361-09"	"#361-09 (6th grader, 01/30/97) First of all, I somehow turned into a bee. I don't know how, but I did. Someone else that I can't remember did too. We were at the zoo, and were flying around and landed on a bench, right in front of the gorillas. I wanted to fly around some more, but whoever was with me told me to watch out for the plastic balls that they were throwing around. The other bee flew around, once to show me, but did get hit by a ball. I flew over, and saw that it was close to being dead. It didn't really mind, though, and talked about how cool it was to have a huge stinger, and told me to get a toothpick. I didn't, so it told me the only way to get us back to normal people was to make the noises like the gorillas. I did, and it worked. We picked up frisbees at the souvenir shop going out of the zoo. When I got home this thing like in the arrival - one that spins around and creates a whirlpool - type-thing and then makes everything into nothing, was in my house, and started. For some reason I wasn't scared at all and just sat there. It didn't harm me at all, but I threw my frisbee in (I don't know why). Setting: At the zoo and my house. Characters: The other bee - I don't know as a person or a bee, unafraid. No one else, except for I saw the Arrival, not too long ago. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, excited, didn't care. Probably the strangest one ever, but it was cool that I saw from a bee's perspective. In science we watched a film on animal behavior including things on bees."
"361-10"	"#361-10 (6th grader, 02/01/97) First, me and Courtlyn were at this store. For some reason we couldn't go past this certain point that I wanted to go past. Then we went to her house, but it wasn't her current house, it was a huge mansion. I remember baking something sweet. Later that day, I went back to the same store with Sandy, Lynne, Claire and Brian. We did go into the part that I really wanted to go, but it wasn't all that exciting after all. But it was still pretty good. We all had bags, so we played ""find the bag."" I hid my bag behind a counter, but no one else had hidden theirs yet. Then Lynne went behind the counter and hid her bag there too, but she didn't see mine. Instead, she started babbling/shouting on and on about how it was the best hiding place. Brian, Claire, Sandy and I heard, but none of us went to find hers there. Setting: In a big store and a big mansion. Characters: I know Brian, Lynne, and Claire, but not very well. Sandy and Courtlyn are my really good friends. I can picture myself at a big store with them, but not with Brian, Lynne or Claire. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, worried. It was VERY weird.
