"0001"	"(05/30/2015)"	"I'm in the Army, I have been to war, and now am in a large military warehouse. I'm climbing up a huge pile of boxes that are packed with thousands of small black toy trains. An MP comes by and harasses me. I start to climb down from the boxes, toppling them, causing the trains to spill out and onto the floor. I tell the MP nobody pushes me around. I threaten him, and he leaves. I walk to another part of the warehouse, a gymnasium. Off to one side, a small group of black women are watching TV. Otherwise, the area is vacant. In my bare feet, I start to skate on the wood floor. I'm going fast, making large sweeping turns. Then a man with movie star looks grabs me. He's kidnapping me. He and others put me in a car. He keeps telling me not to fight him, but I won't let him go. They drive me to a place where criminals do business. The man in the car wants to kill me. We struggle. He keeps trying to break free. I call to the criminals as they walk past, but it's hard to speak, I make only garbled sounds. Then they hear and see me and approach, and I say to them, ""Kill him."" I wake up moaning those words."
"0002"	"(06/02/2015)"	"I'm in bed with a wild tiger that is biting my hand. To stop the attack, I reach back and squeeze its rear end, then poke its rectum. At first the animal continues to bite, but then finally stops. I wake up.    "
"0003"	"(06/03/2015)"	"I'm in a classroom for adults. It's crowded. I'm sitting in the back, half hidden by other students. The subject is math, my worst subject. Then I look to see if the teacher is there, but she is gone. I move to be closer with the other students. Someone messes my hair. Another teacher, an old man in a suit with wild hair, takes charge of the class. He pesters me. I ask him, ""Do you want to get stabbed?"" He doesn't hear me, and walks away. The others can't seem to tell if my question was real or a joke."
"0004"	"(06/03/2015)"	"I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth. A tooth implant that in real life must be repaired, and will eventually fail, falls from my mouth. It looks to be made of copper. I'm scared. I call the dentist. A man answers the phone and says the dentist is on the way. Then a black man is on the phone. He seems to be in a night club. There is jazzy music in the background. His voice is casual, elegant, lighthearted and boozy. The dentist walks in. He is young, athletic and stocky, bare-chested. I'm surprised and relieved. I kiss his forehead. I say, ""What brought you here?"" Then I wake up."
"0005"	"(06/03/2015)"	"At a party of some kind I meet a girl known from grammar school. She remains tall, awkward and insecure. We end up in a bedroom where I try to seduce her. She resists. I become affectionate toward her, but she has trouble accepting my feelings.  When I go to the bathroom to pee, one stall is occupied by a boy in a wheelchair. The other is unoccupied, but an anxious man stands in the way. He leaves. The window in the bedroom is open. I think, if we have sex, people will hear us. The girl asks for a tissue, which I get for her. She is so awkward. I wake up."
"0006"	"(06/04/2015)"	"At a crowded seaport, I run into a woman that I had dated twenty years ago. We sit and talk. She puts her hands on my arms and says she still loves me. I feel the same toward her. It feels wonderful. We go for a walk. She once worked here and points out a large flag mast; at its base, there is a small rusty prong. She says it has caught on her clothes many times. I break it off. A policeman or guard arrives. He asks what I've done. I tell him. He puts me under arrest but I knock him down, and kick and pummel him. To create a panic that will help us escape, I grab his pistol and fire it in the air, yelling ""Gun! Gun!"" Then I wake up."
"0007"	"(06/06/2015)"	"I'm staying with a friend in an apartment building that is similar to the one I lived in as a teen. There's a bottle of Coke by the front door.  My friend says someone is looking for me and points out the window. I recognize a man from my unit in Vietnam. I yell to him, ""Gary Owen! Gary Owen!"" the password we used in the jungle when coming in from patrol. But he does not reply. When it's time to go, my friend says to be careful, they are looking to get me. In the hallway, someone stabs me several times. I'm bleeding. I wake up. I'm fearful for several minutes."
"0008"	"(06/06/2015)"	"I'm at a grungy bar. I'm told that the people who want to harm me would like to make a peace offering of 1000 roses. I say that doesn't sound right and point out the cost. A very tall impoverished black man (an Army vet?) enters the bar. He goes from one person to the next asking for money or cigarettes. He comes to me, and blocks my way out. I get up and deliberately walk toward him and tell him, ""No,"" I have nothing to give him. I'm not intimidated by him. I'm going to walk right past him. Then I wake up."
"0009"	"(06/06/2015)"	"I make my way into a private party. It's dark outside. Celebrities are everywhere. I want to meet Paul Newman but can't find him. I return to the party when everyone is gone and steal sunglasses they have left behind. I'm almost found out but manage to sneak away just as the owner of the house, a woman who resembles either my mother or a college professor who wanted to have an affair, returns. I'm wearing sunglasses that I have found. From a safe distance I look back to see who she is but she doesn't appear. I'm eating a bar of chocolate. "
"0010"	"(06/07/2015)"	"It's night. I'm with a half dozen men defending a small position that is part country, part city. Men who would harm us start to advance and surround us. I tell this to another man. We will soon be attacked. I wake up."
"0011"	"(06/07/2015)"	"It's night. I'm returning to my apartment in a dungeon-like building in New York. It's dangerous. I want to get inside. Once in, I see someone banging on the window. I should be frightened but I'm not. The small man tells me about a job offer in social work. He resembles a VN vet seen in a store last week. I go to the interview. A young black man performs a comedic act. Then a young woman tells me about the job. It's clear she has done this many times. She pitches an entry-level job as if it is exciting and desirable. Until I ask, she leaves out the actual work details, which are to administer cognitive tests to children. The location is vague. A female cashier I speak to talks up the job but I'm more interested in her bust than what she says.  I don't want this job. It reminds me of past experiences in life. I don't want it at all. I don't immediately decline, but ask the female interviewer to send me details. Then I walk towards an open area with trees and grass. There is a table with fruit on it. I accidentally drop some on the ground. Several policemen sit at the table for lunch. Recollection ends here."
"0012"	"(06/08/2015)"	"I'm in a classroom. It's dark. The class is made up of Hispanic people, mostly adults. Everyone is lying on the floor. I try to move, but I can't. I repeatedly scream ""Help, I can't move."" No one offers to help. I wake up fearful."
"0013"	"(06/09/2015)"	"In a sort of basement, another man and I are combating a large industrial oven. Its grill is advancing toward us. We can see the blazing fire and embers inside it. The oven advances closer and closer. Finally, the other man grabs me. I say to them, ""Get me away, boys."" And they lift me out of danger, at the same time inspecting me for burns. My fingertips are burned to the bones; they glow like embers. Otherwise, I'm OK."
"0014"	"(06/09/2015)"	"It's morning. I'm in a large rundown hotel room which is part of a single story complex in a rundown area. A bad smell starts to permeate the room. I open the door. Outside, my mother is washing the floor with ammonia. I yell at her.  I say, ""That's ammonia. It's coming into my room. What are you doing? Why didn't you tell me?"" I try to stop her. We begin to fight. She hits me in the legs with the mop. She yells, ""Get out."" My brother appears. We move toward each other aggressively. We're both angry and willing to fight. I say to him, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" Just before we're about to fight he backs off and I leave."
"0015"	"(06/10/2015)"	"I'm in the bedroom of an apartment lived in during adolescence. It's morning. There's something on the windowsill. The kitten resembles a cat from N town, where I lived a year as a child.  It must have entered through a window. The answering machine picks up a phone call. I think, ""No one calls me; who is it?"" I don't recognize the voice. It's hard to tell what she is saying. I wonder how long the kitten has been here. Where does it relieve itself? I tell the kitten I don't want it here.  I open the front door. The cat scurries down the steps, then runs outside. I'm bare-chested and conscious of my abs. As in life, they are strong from exercise. I wonder if my downstairs neighbors will see me."
"0016"	"(06/11/2015)"	"I'm in my 30s and dating Roberta, a woman known while an undergrad. She is bright, sincere, confident, though not good looking. We decide to go to a movie.  I ask about getting there by subway. She's says we have a little time.  Then we are waiting in line at an airport. I recognize the man in front of me.  He is Wally H., one of my best friends in college (who later became a movie star). He is young and strikingly handsome and without guile. But to greet him, first I have to straddle a banister. In doing so, I say, ""If I don't do this right, I won't be walking for a while,"" or similar words. Then I say, ""Wally, this is Roberta. Roberta, this is Wally."" In fact, they had dated each other in college. Throughout the dream I feel good."
"0017"	"(06/12/2015)"	"I'm standing in front of a very tall cyclone wire fence. It's not sturdy. The top is especially flimsy. There's no way to climb over it. I'm wondering how to get to the other side. It's as if I've done this before."
"0018"	"(06/12/2015)"	"It's late at night. I'm in the bedroom of my college friend John K.'s brother Jerry, who is drinking and using power tools. He isn't building anything of use. He isn't making much sense. My friend David is getting ready to sleep in his own room nearby. I'm trying to go to sleep on the floor but it's too noisy. Finally, I get up and leave Jerry's room and sleep in Dave's room in a bed. All the while I'm aware that in real life David and Jerry are not brothers, even though they act that way in the dream."
"0019"	"(06/13/2015)"	"I'm in college, going from room to room in a large and spacious old building. I'm feeling good. The rooms are bright and neat and well kept. It's a cheerful place. I want to get rid of a large colorful towel, but a worker sees me so I carry it to the right place. Then I'm in a room with someone I know. It's well lit but somehow dark. A piece of thick paper, like a playing card, floats in the air. I show the other person how to grab it. Then he tries and with some difficulty, succeeds. Then I see something else floating in the air, but I'm waking up and it's actually the window fan in my bedroom."
"0020"	"(06/13/2015)"	"I'm in a Jewish community in the country. I meet a woman and want to sleep with her, but she declines. There is an ongoing conflict with another group, who are violent. I find one of their men stuffed in a barrel or small heavy tub. He's been executed.  I meet another woman. She has huge breasts. I go into a room. One of us is taking a shower. For a moment I see her undressing. Her breasts sag. I feel doubtful toward her and lose interest.  Then I meet an exotic looking young man with braided hair. We are in bed. I begin to cuddle him. Recollection ends here."
"0021"	"(06/14/2015)"	"I'm in a medical office in an old building in Europe. The light is soft, not glaring, like in a US. There's no one present.  For a time I look at delicate small plants in a display case which are for sale. They are too expensive for me. This place is also where Erin, my former girlfriend, seems to live. I look for her, and find her brothers or people who know her, but they don't know where she is. I wander around the office rooms. Then I levitate, and float slowly from one room to the next. I want to meet doctors and show them this can be done. I'm floating in a doctor's living quarters. It's exciting, the thought of him or her returning without seeing me. I will see them undress. I hear clothing being unzipped. I wake up."
"0022"	"(06/15/2015)"	"I'm telling someone about an Army Green Beret. Then I can't breathe. I'm struggling for air but I can't breathe. I wake up. [I have this kind of dream once or twice a month.]"
"0023"	"(06/15/2015)"	"I'm in a big old-fashioned school.  I'm about thirty years old. There are no classes, just many high school students partying, and I join in. At one point I steal a large knife and walk through busy hallways with it, then hide it under my trousers beneath my sock. Then the school is nearly empty. I want to stay but I leave by jumping down a long staircase.  Now I'm outside in desolate highlands. There are no trees, only mounds and rows of dry earth instead of mountains. There are school children nearby. Everyone is happy.  I take a path that leads to many trees and branches that must be climbed up or over in order to get past.  I'm singing. There's an old man just behind me. We're both good at finding our way through this thicket. It's like rock climbing. The goal is to some other place. Recollection ends here."
"0024"	"(06/15/2015)"	"I'm with my friends from Veterans for Peace. I have an idea for a play. It's based on a photo I took of my platoon in VN. When the new picture is taken, we are all dressed in bulky but fashionable clothes dyed in earthy reds and browns.  We look a bit like Taliban, or Arab fighters. We will tour the country. At a train station, we stand like the platoon in the photo.  I'm the leader, and I want people to see me, to know that. My mood is very good. Recollection ends."
"0025"	"(06/16/2015)"	"[having spent the afternoon with Erin. She hopes to leave the US for France soon.] I'm with Erin. We're in the country. It's our final time together. It's just understood. We care for each other very much. I go into a bar, looking for the owner. I walk towards a man who I mistake for him. We hold eye contact as I walk forward. He looks familiar-like someone from life. Both of us become aggressive. I need to bluff him and challenge him to a fight. We are almost fighting, grabbing each other. He has my throat. He is so confident. Another man, behind him, is watching. We agree to fight later. Erin waits outside and sees none of this. We meet friends. We spend time together. We go for a walk at night, very much in love. I'm waiting for the right moment to tell her about the fight. I know that the man watching and the man I mistook for the owner have it in for me. And I know that he is the better fighter. I have concern, not fear. Erin and I reach an old wooden porch. She wants to sit down. Thorny brambles cover the seat; still, it's possible to sit down. I tell her about the fight. I ask a favor. To call the police if the fight gets bad. Recollection ends here."
"0026"	"(06/16/2015)"	"I'm walking in the big yard of my grammar school. I'm just leaving when two people who work there pass by. One of them, a black man, is wearing a starched Army fatigue shirt, buttoned at the collar. I want to tell him it looks silly, but I say nothing. I walk past someone who knows me. He begins to say my name loudly, then goes quiet. I warn him not to give me away. I tell him I know that the two people want to kill me. I tell him I'm going to tell the police, who will come here and arrest them. Recollection ends here."
"0027"	"(06/17/2015)"	"I'm with two or three other people on the shoreline of a large lake or the ocean. We're here to fish. I climb up on a tall platform. I'm looking out to the horizon. It grows dark. I see something far away in the water. I shout to the others ""Listen up! Listen up!"" but my voice is not loud. I feel an ominous presence. I'm fearful. I wake up."
"0028"	"(06/17/2015)"	"It's night. I'm in a bedroom similar to backpacker guesthouses in Asia and Central America. It's made of concrete blocks, not well lit, somewhat grim and spartan. I can't sleep. I have to make sure the door is locked. I get out of bed. In Spanish I say, ""Hey buddy, what's happening, man?"" I turn the doorknob and am surprised that the door is unlocked. When I press against the door, it feels like someone is pushing back, but it's only the wind. Still, I'm fearful. I wake up."
"0029"	"(06/19/2015)"	"I'm in a large cinder block building, similar to an airplane hangar or warehouse. I'm waiting to see Joe, a feisty old man who worked at a sweet shop when I was young. In the dream, he runs a general merchandise store. Other customers wait for him too. I'm with someone else, a friend. We begin to argue over something he's said. It's a misunderstanding I could have let pass. I go to another part of the store. I see a man who looks like Joe, but it's his son. Another young man approaches me. It seems like I know him from life. He has an ornately trimmed beard. He wants to show me his artwork. We walk to an open area. He's very friendly, very sincere. He points to canvas workbags he has painted red. There is little skill involved. I tell him it's really good. I'm aware this is the right thing to do. Then I go back in the store. I see Joe. He is much younger than I expected. He wears his hair in a Mohawk. He doesn't recognize me. Then I say goodbye to my friend, or to the younger man I met. I'm shaking his hand. I'm talking to him. When I wake up, I'm saying, ""It was nice meeting you."""
"0030"	"(06/21/2015)"	"I'm hanging with a high school crowd. I'm in conflict with a punk, who I knew in real life. The police come. He's now in trouble. After sticking around for a while, I don't feel safe and decide to leave. It's dark and raining. I'm walking in the pitch black through thick vegetation. There's a deep ditch to watch out for. I arrive at a house similar to those of my childhood. I walk through the house to the back door and try to lock it. As I'm doing this, some of the high school crowd arrives. The punk is with them. I tell him he has to leave. We start to grapple. I wake up."
"0031"	"(06/21/2015)"	"I'm on another planet in a large cave with a high ceiling. The cave contains a variety of large equipment. A voice tells us that we are going to be used in an experiment. A thick billowing cloud, like tear gas, begins to fill the cave. There's no way out. I wake up."
"0032"	"(06/22/2015)"	"There's a man on a bus in the driver's seat who has taken a little boy hostage. He has a knife to the boy's throat. I volunteer to take the boy's place. When I go up to the man, he is now docile. In this moment I have to decide what to do. I take the man's hand. I lead him out of the bus. We will walk toward another man named Ali, who I call out to, and who will make things right. I tell the hostage-taking man everything will be OK. The neighborhood we are passing through resembles the area where my mother once had a store. As we walk, my brother passes by and says something to me. The hostage-taking man lets my hand go and begins to drift away from where we are headed. I wake up."
